It ran much faster and was more convenient to use than other Z80-hosted compilers of the time.  It was possible to run BDS C on single-[[floppy]] machines with as little as 30K of [[Random access memory|RAM]] - something of a minor miracle by comparison to most other commercial compilers which required many passes and the writing of intermediate files to disk.  Around 75,000 copies were sold, including a stripped down Japanese incarnation.\n\nA number of important commercial CP/M products were written in the BDS C subset (no [[long integer]], no [[floating-point arithmetic]]) of the C language, including [[PeachText]] from [[PeachTree Software]], [[MINCE]] and Scribble from [[Mark of the Unicorn]], and most of the software in the [[Perfect Software]] suite including [[Perfect Writer]], [[PerfectCalc]], [[PerfectSpeller]] and [[PerfectFiler]] (which suite was bundled with the [[Kaypro]]).\n\nBDS C was very memory efficient, with fast compilation speeds.

It ran much faster and was more convenient to use than other Z80-hosted compilers of the time.  It was possible to run BDS C on single-[[floppy]] machines with as little as 30K of [[Random access memory|RAM]] - something of a minor miracle by comparison to most other commercial compilers which required many passes and the writing of intermediate files to disk.  Around 75,000 copies were sold, including a stripped down Japanese incarnation.\n\nA number of important commercial CP/M products were written in the BDS C subset (no [[long integer]], no [[floating-point arithmetic]]) of the C language, including [[PeachText]] from [[PeachTree Software]], [[MINCE]] and Scribble from [[Mark of the Unicorn]], and most of the software in the [[Perfect Software]] suite including [[Perfect Writer]], [[PerfectCalc]], [[PerfectSpeller]] and [[PerfectFiler]] (which suite was bundled with the [[Kaypro]]).\n\nBDS C was very memory efficient, with fast compilation speeds. Weak points were that the [[floating point]] math routines and the file access functions were incompatible with the Unix C compiler's and its relocatable object files were not compatible with the Microsoft assembler, making it more difficult to integrate C code with [[assembly language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Official_Book_for_the_Commodore_128/The_Official_Book_for_the_Commodore_128_djvu.txt |title=The Official Book for the Commodore 128}}</ref>\n\nBDS C was bundled with a subset of the Unix system written in about 1980, called MARC (Machine Assisted Resource Coordinator).

{"title_page": "Hide (unit)", "text_new": "{{short description|Historical unit of land measurement}}\nThe '''hide''' was an [[English units|English unit]] of land measurement originally intended to represent the amount of land sufficient to support a household. It was traditionally taken to be {{convert|120|acre|abbr=off}}, but was in fact a measure of value and [[tax assessment]], including obligations for food-rent (''{{lang|ang|feorm}}''), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army (''{{lang|ang|[[fyrd]]}}''), and (eventually) the ''{{lang|ang|geld}}'' [[land tax]]. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]], the hidage assessments were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] and there was a tendency for land producing [[GBP|\u00a3]]1 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe hide was divided into 4 [[yardland]]s or [[virgate]]s.

A Dictionary of Units of Measurement | author = Russ Rowlett | accessdate = 3 November 2017}}</ref> a unit used in the [[Danelaw]].\n\n==Original meaning==\nThe Anglo-Saxon word for a hide was ''hid'' (or its synonym ''hiwisc''). Both words are believed to be derived from the same root ''hiwan'', which meant \"family\".\n\n[[Bede]] in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' (c. 731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, ''terra x familiarum'' meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work ''hid'' or ''hiwan'' is used in place of ''terra ... familiarum''. Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his household<ref>Lennard pp.58-60</ref> or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.<ref>Faith (1997) pp.132-7</ref>\n\nCharles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman,<ref>Charles-Edwards p.5</ref> to whom Stenton referred as \"the independent master of a peasant household\".<ref>Stenton p.278</ref>\n\n==Holy Roman usage==\nHides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (''miles'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 807 it was specified that in the region west of the Seine, for example, a vassal who held four or five hides was responsible for showing up to a muster in person, fully equipped for war. Three men who each possessed one hide, though, merely were grouped such that two of them were responsible for equipping the third, who would go to war in their name. Those holding half-hides were responsible for readying one man for every group of six. This came about as a way of ensuring that the liege took to the field with a fully equipped and provisioned force.<ref>Delbr\u00fcck, 18</ref>\n\n==In Anglo-Saxon England==\nIn early [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of [[food rent]] (known as ''feorm'') due from a village or estate and it became the unit on which all public obligations were assessed, including in particular the maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications and the provision of troops for manning the defences of a town or for the defence force known as the 'fyrd'. For instance, at one period, five hides were expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the [[burh]]s and to help in their initial construction and upkeep.<ref name=powicke18>Powicke. Military Obligation in Medieval England. pp.18-21</ref>\n\nA land tax known as geld was first levied in 990 and this became known as the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already existing system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the geld, which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the geld was raised as required.<ref name=lipson16>E. Lipson, The Economic History of England, 12th ed., vol. 1 p. 16</ref>\n\nThe hide was a measure of value rather than a measurement of area,<ref>Faith (1997) p.91</ref> but the logic of its assessment is not easy to understand, especially as assessments were changed from time to time and not always consistently. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was a measure of 'the taxable worth of an area of land', but it had no fixed relationship to its area, the number of ploughteams working on it, or its population; nor was it limited to the arable land on an estate. According to Bailey, \"It is a commonplace that the hide in 1086 had a very variable extent on the ground; the old concept of 120 acres cannot be sustained.\"<ref>Bailey, p. 5</ref>  Many details of the development of the system during the 350 years which elapsed between  the time of Bede and the Domesday Book remain obscure. According to [[Frank Stenton|Sir Frank Stenton]], \"Despite the work of many great scholars the hide of early English texts remains a term of elusive meaning.\"<ref>Stenton, p. 279</ref> The fact that assessments consistently tended to be made in units of 5 hides or multiples of 5 hides goes to show that we are not speaking of fixed or even approximate acreages and this applies not only to the 11th century but to charters of the 7th and 8th centuries.<ref>Stenton p.287</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the hide became the basis of an artificial system of assessment of land for purposes of taxation, which lasted for a long period. The most consistent aspect of the hide is described as follows by Dr Sally Harvey (referring particularly to Domesday Book): \"Both Maitland and Vinogradoff long ago noticed that there was a general tendency throughout Domesday for a hide of land to be worth \u00a31, or, put another way, for land producing \u00a31 of income to be assessed at one hide.\"<ref>Harvey (1987) pp.252-2</ref>\n\nA number of early documents referring to hides have survived, but these can only be seen as steps in the development of the concept of the hide and do not enable us to see the full story.\n\nThe document known as the [[Tribal Hidage]] is a very early list thought to date possibly from the 7th century, but known only from a later and unreliable manuscript. It is a list of tribes and small kingdoms owing tribute to an overlord and of the proportionate liability or quota imposed on each of them. This is expressed in terms of hides, though we have no details as to how these were arrived at nor how they were converted into a cash liability.<ref>Stenton p.295.  See also Cyril Hart: The Tribal Hidage in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 5th series  Vol.21 (1971)</ref>\n\nThe [[Burghal Hidage]] (early 10th century) is a list of boroughs giving the hide assessments of neighbouring districts which were liable to contribute to the defence of the borough, each contributing to the maintenance and manning of the fortifications in proportion to the number of hides for which they answered.<ref>Stenton p.265.  See also David Hill & A.R.Rumble (edd): The Defence of Wessex - The Burghal Hidage (1996)</ref>\n\nThe County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each [[County#United Kingdom|county]] was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, [[Northamptonshire]] was assigned 3,200 hides, while [[Staffordshire]] was assigned only 500.<ref>Stenton, p. 646.</ref> This number was then divided up between the [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]]s in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown.\n\nThe hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or [[manorialism|manors]], usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.<ref>Stenton, pp.644-6; Darby, pp.1-12.</ref>\n\nAs each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible.\n\n==After the Norman conquest==\nThe Norman kings, after the [[Norman Conquest]], continued to use the system which they found in place. Geld was levied at intervals on the existing hidage assessments. In  1084,  [[William the Conqueror|William I]] laid an exceptionally heavy geld  of six shillings upon every hide. At the time the value of  the hide was approximating twenty shillings a year,  and the price of an ox was two shillings. Thus the holder of a hide had a  tax burden equivalent to three of his oxen and close upon one-third  of the annual value of his land.<ref name=\"lipson16\"/> A more normal rate was 2 shillings on each hide.\n\n[[Domesday Book]], recording the results of the survey made on the orders of William I  in 1086, states in hides (or [[carucate]]s or sulungs as the case might be) the assessed values of estates throughout the area covered by the survey.<ref name=darby106 /> Usually it gives this information for 1086 and 1066, but some counties were different and only showed this information for one of those dates. By that time the assessments showed many anomalies.<ref name=darby106>See for example Darby, pp. 106-8, and Bailey.</ref> Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066  and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.<ref>Harvey (1987) pp.257ff</ref>\n\nSometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the [[demesne]] land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it.  Dr Sally Harvey has suggested that the ploughland data in Domesday Book was intended to be used for a complete re-assessment but, if so, it was never actually made.<ref>Harvey pp.186-189</ref> The [[Pipe Rolls]], where they are available, show that levies were based largely on the old assessments, though with some amendments and exemptions.\n\nThe last recorded levy was for 1162-3 during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], but the tax was not formally abolished and Henry II thought of using it again between 1173 and 1175. The old assessments were used for a tax on land in 1193-4 to raise money for King Richard's ransom.<ref>See J.A.Green</ref>\n\n==Relationship to other terms==\nA hide was usually made up of four [[virgate]]s although exceptionally [[Sussex]] had eight virgates to the hide.<ref name=\"brandon198\">Dennis Haselgrove. The domesday record of Sussex ''in'' Brandon's. South Saxons. pp. 198-199</ref> A similar measure was used in the northern [[Danelaw]], known as a  [[carucate]], consisting of eight [[Oxgang|bovate]]s, and [[Kent]] used a system based on a \"sulung\", consisting of four [[Yoke (unit of measurement)|yokes]], which was larger than the hide and on occasion treated as equivalent to two hides.<ref>Stenton, pp. 281-2, 647</ref> These measures had a different origin, signifying the amount of land which could be cultivated by one plough team as opposed to a family holding, but all later became artificial fiscal assessments.\n\nIn some counties in Domesday Book (e.g. Cambridgeshire), the hide is sometimes shown as consisting of 120 acres (30 acres to the virgate), but as Darby explains: \"The acres are, of course, not units of area, but geld acres, i.e. units of assessment\". In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one-third ({{frac|40|120}}) of 2 shillings\u2014that is, 8 pence\u2014though his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.<ref>Darby (1971) p.274 and see Maitland (1987 edition) p.475</ref>\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Bailey, Keith, ''The Hidation of Buckinghamshire'', in Records of Buckinghamshire, Vol.32, 1990 (pp.&nbsp;1\u201322)\n* {{Cite book|editor-last=Brandon|editor-first=Peter|year=1978|title=The South Saxons|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0-85033-240-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/southsaxons0000unse}}\n*Charles-Edwards, T.M., ''Kinship, Status and the Origins of the Hide''  in  Past & Present, Vol. 36 1972 (pp.&nbsp;3\u201333)\n* Darby, Henry C., ''Domesday England'', Cambridge University Press, 1977\n* Darby, Henry C.; ''The Domesday Geography of Eastern England'', Cambridge university Pree, 1971\n* Delbr\u00fcck, Hans, trans.

It was traditionally taken to be {{convert|120|acre|abbr=off}}, but was in fact a measure of value and [[tax assessment]], including obligations for food-rent (''{{lang|ang|feorm}}''), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army (''{{lang|ang|[[fyrd]]}}''), and (eventually) the ''{{lang|ang|geld}}'' [[land tax]]. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]], the hidage assessments were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] and there was a tendency for land producing [[GBP|\u00a3]]1 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe hide was divided into 4 [[yardland]]s or [[virgate]]s.

Both words are believed to be derived from the same root ''hiwan'', which meant \"family\".\n\n[[Bede]] in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' (c. 731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, ''terra x familiarum'' meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work ''hid'' or ''hiwan'' is used in place of ''terra ... familiarum''. Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his household<ref>Lennard pp.58-60</ref> or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.<ref>Faith (1997) pp.132-7</ref>\n\nCharles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman,<ref>Charles-Edwards p.5</ref> to whom Stenton referred as \"the independent master of a peasant household\".<ref>Stenton p.278</ref>\n\n==Holy Roman usage==\nHides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (''miles'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

See also David Hill & A.R.Rumble (edd): The Defence of Wessex - The Burghal Hidage (1996)</ref>\n\nThe County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each [[County#United Kingdom|county]] was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, [[Northamptonshire]] was assigned 3,200 hides, while [[Staffordshire]] was assigned only 500.<ref>Stenton, p. 646.</ref> This number was then divided up between the [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]]s in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown.\n\nThe hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or [[manorialism|manors]], usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.<ref>Stenton, pp.644-6; Darby, pp.1-12.</ref>\n\nAs each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible.\n\n==After the Norman conquest==\nThe Norman kings, after the [[Norman Conquest]], continued to use the system which they found in place.

By that time the assessments showed many anomalies.<ref name=darby106>See for example Darby, pp. 106-8, and Bailey.</ref> Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066  and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.<ref>Harvey (1987) pp.257ff</ref>\n\nSometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the [[demesne]] land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it.

The domesday record of Sussex ''in'' Brandon's.

In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one-third ({{frac|40|120}}) of 2 shillings\u2014that is, 8 pence\u2014though his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.<ref>Darby (1971) p.274 and see Maitland (1987 edition) p.475</ref>\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Bailey, Keith, ''The Hidation of Buckinghamshire'', in Records of Buckinghamshire, Vol.32, 1990 (pp.&nbsp;1\u201322)\n* {{Cite book|editor-last=Brandon|editor-first=Peter|year=1978|title=The South Saxons|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester|isbn=0-85033-240-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/southsaxons0000unse}}\n*Charles-Edwards, T.M., ''Kinship, Status and the Origins of the Hide''  in  Past & Present, Vol. 36 1972 (pp.&nbsp;3\u201333)\n* Darby, Henry C., ''Domesday England'', Cambridge University Press, 1977\n* Darby, Henry C.; ''The Domesday Geography of Eastern England'', Cambridge university Pree, 1971\n* Delbr\u00fcck, Hans, trans.

Mutualists disagree with the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Although opposed to this type of income, Proudhon expressed that he had never intended \"to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital.

Bestor, Jr., \"The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary\", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Jun., 1948), 259\u2013302.</ref> although the reference was not to an economic system. The first use of the noun mutualist was in the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' by an American [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] in 1826.<ref>''New-Harmony Gazette'', I, 301\u201302 (14 June 1826) cited in Arthur E.

Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements. Broadview Press. p. 100</ref> In ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that \"[t]he word \"mutualism\" seems to have been first used by [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], an English writer, in 1832\".<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism?</ref> When Gray's 1825 ''Lecture on Human Happiness'' was first published in the United States in 1826, the publishers appended the ''Preamble and Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests, Located at Valley Forge''. 1826 also saw the publication of the ''Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests at [[Kendal, Ohio]]''.\n\nBy 1846, Proudhon was speaking of ''mutualit\u00e9'' in his writings and he used the term ''mutuellisme'' at least as early as 1848 in his \"Programme R\u00e9volutionnaire\". In 1850, [[William Batchelder Greene]] used the term mutualism to describe a mutual credit system similar to that of Proudhon. In 1850, the American newspaper ''The Spirit of the Age'', edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a mutualist township by Joshua King Ingalls<ref>Joshua King Ingalls, \"A Practical Movement for Transition,\" Spirit of the Age, II, 13 (March 30, 1850), pp. 202\u201304.</ref> and Albert Brisbane,<ref>Albert Brisbane, \"The Mutualist Township,\" The Spirit of the Age, II, 12 (March 23, 1850), 179\u201383.;  II, 13 (March 30, 1850), 200\u2013202.</ref> together with works by Proudhon,<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, \"The Coming Era of Mutualism,\" ''Spirit of the Age'', I, 7 (August 18, 1849), 107\u201308.</ref> Greene, [[Pierre Leroux]] and others.\n\nProudhon ran for the [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|French Constituent Assembly]] in April 1848, but was not elected, although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille. He was successful in the complementary elections of June 4 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. He was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nProudhon was surprised by the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic. However, he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767\u20131855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849<!-- which month? -->, ''Solution du probl\u00e8me social'' (''Solution of the Social Problem''), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\n=== 19th century United States ===\nMutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. [[Labor notes (currency)|Labor notes]] were first discussed in [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Time Store]] of former [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] member and [[individualist anarchist]] [[Josiah Warren]]. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with [[William Batchelder Greene]], but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, [[Edward Kellogg (economist)|Edward Kellogg]] and William Beck as well as from the land bank tradition.\n\n[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|200px|[[American individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]], one of the individualist anarchists influenced by Proudhon's mutualism]]\nMutualism can in many ways be considered the original [[anarchy]] since [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first to identify himself as an [[anarchist]]. Although mutualism is generally associated with anarchism, it is not necessarily anarchist. Historian [[Wendy McElroy]] reports that [[American individualist anarchism]] received an important influence of three European thinkers. One of the most important of these influences was the French political philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whose words \"Liberty is not the Daughter But the Mother of Order\" appeared as a motto on ''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]''{{'}}s masthead.<ref name=\"mises\">[[Wendy McElroy]]. [https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf \"The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America\"].</ref> ''Liberty'' was an influential [[American individualist anarchist]] publication of [[Benjamin Tucker]]. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]. [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\".<ref name=\"againstallauthority.org\">Eunice Minette Scuster.

[...] \"Mind your own business\", \"Judge not that ye be not judged\". Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason, he demands \"mutuality\" in marriage\u2014the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property\".<ref name=\"againstallauthority.org\"/>\n\nTucker later connected his economic views with those of Proudhon, Warren and [[Karl Marx]], taking sides with the first two while also arguing against American anti-socialists who declared socialism as imported, stating: {{quote|The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his \"Wealth of Nations,\" \u2013 namely, that labor is the true measure of price. [...] Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy. [...] This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew. [...] That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought. So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, \u2013 a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article.<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-individual-liberty ''Individual Liberty'' by Benjamin Tucker]</ref>}}\n\n=== 19th century Spain ===\n[[File:Pi y margall.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Francesc Pi i Margall]], briefly [[President of Spain|President]] of the [[First Spanish Republic]] and main Spanish translator of Proudhon's works]]\nMutualist ideas found fertile ground in the 19th century in Spain.

His political ideas had much in common with those of [[Richard Price]], [[Joseph Priestly]] [''sic''], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period.

M. Stekloff, in April 1856 \"arrived from Paris a deputation of Proudhonist workers whose aim it was to bring about the foundation of a Universal League of Workers. The object of the League was the social emancipation of the working class, which, it was held, could only be achieved by a union of the workers of all lands against international capital. Since the deputation was one of Proudhonists, of course this emancipation was to be secured, not by political methods, but purely by economic means, through the foundation of productive and distributive co-operatives\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch02.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]</ref> Stekloff continues by saying that \"[i]t was in the 1863 elections that for the first time workers' candidates were run in opposition to bourgeois republicans, but they secured very few votes. [...] [A] group of working-class Proudhonists (among whom were Murat and Tolain, who were subsequently to participate in the founding of the (First) International issued the famous Manifesto of the Sixty, which, though extremely moderate in tone, marked a turning point in the history of the French movement. For years and years the bourgeois liberals had been insisting that the revolution of 1789 had abolished class distinctions. The Manifesto of the Sixty loudly proclaimed that classes still existed. These classes were the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The latter had its specific class interests, which none but workers could be trusted to defend. The inference drawn by the Manifesto was that there must be independent working-class candidates\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch03.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]</ref>\n\nFor Stekloff, \"the Proudhonists, who were at that date the leaders of the French section of the International. They looked upon the International Workingmen's Association as a sort of academy or synagogue, where Talmudists or similar experts could \"investigate\" the workers' problem; wherein the spirit of Proudhon they could excogitate means for an accurate solution of the problem, without being disturbed by the stresses of a political campaign.

Carson's thesis is that an authentic [[free-market]] economy would not be capitalism as the separation of labor from ownership and the subordination of labor to capital would be impossible, bringing a classless society where people could easily choose between working as a freelancer, working for a [[Living wage|fair wage]], taking part of a cooperative, or being an entrepreneur. As did [[Benjamin Tucker]] before him, he notes that a mutualist free-market system would involve significantly different property rights than capitalism is based on, particularly in terms of land and intellectual property.<ref>Caron, Kevin (2001).

Mutualism is often described by its proponents as advocating an anti-capitalist free market. Mutualists argue that most of the economic problems associated with capitalism each amount to a violation of the cost principle, or as [[Josiah Warren]] interchangeably said, the cost the limit of price. It was inspired by the [[labor theory of value]] which was popularized\u2014although not invented\u2014by [[Adam Smith]] in 1776 (Proudhon mentioned Smith as an inspiration). The labor theory of value holds that the actual price of a thing (or the true cost) is the amount of labor that was undertaken to produce it. In Warren's terms, cost should be the limit of price, with cost referring to the amount of labor required to produce a good or service. Anyone who sells goods should charge no more than the cost to himself of acquiring these goods.\n\n=== Contract and federation ===\nMutualism holds that producers should exchange their goods at cost-value using systems of contract. While Proudhon's early definitions of cost-value were based on fixed assumptions about the value of labor-hours, he later redefined cost-value to include other factors such as the intensity of labor, the nature of the work involved and so on. He also expanded his notions of contract into expanded notions of federation. As Proudhon argued: {{quote|I have shown the contractor, at the birth of industry, negotiating on equal terms with his comrades, who have since become his workmen. It is plain, in fact, that this original equality was bound to disappear through the advantageous position of the master and the dependent position of the wage-workers. In vain does the law assure the right of each to enterprise. [...] When an establishment has had leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can a workman do against a power so superior?<ref>System of Economical Contradictions, p. 202</ref>}}\n\n=== Gradualism and dual power ===\n{{main|Dual power}}\nDual power is the process of building alternative institutions to the ones that already exist in modern society. Originally theorized by Proudhon, it has become adopted by many anti-state movements like [[autonomism]] and [[agorism]]. Proudhon described it as such: <blockquote>Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political institutions, out of the sight of statemen and priests, society is producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy.<ref>Proudhon, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.'' Translated by John Beverly Robinson. New York: Haskell House Publishers, Ltd., 1923, 1969 [1851]. p. 243.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDual power should not be confused with the dual power popularized by [[Vladimir Lenin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}</ref> as it was also theorized by Proudhon<ref>{{cite book|first=Murray|last=Bookchin|title=The Third Revolution: Popular Movements in the Revolutionary Era|volume=2|publisher=A&C Black|year=1996|page=115|quote=Proudhon made the bright suggestion, in his periodical ''Le Repr\u00e9sentant du peuple'' (April 28, 1848), that the mass democracy of the clubs could become a popular forum where the social agenda of the revolution could be prepared for use by the [[Constituent Assembly]]\u2014a proposal that would essentially have defused the potency of the clubs as a potentially rebellious dual power.}}</ref> and it refers to a more specific scenario where a revolutionary entity intentionally maintains the structure of the previous political institutions until the power of the previous institution is weakened enough such that the revolutionary entity can overtake it entirely. Dual power as implemented by mutualists and agorists is the development of the alternative institution itself.\n\n=== Free association ===\n{{main|Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|l1=Free association}}\nMutualists argue that association is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other\u2014and without association they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave.\n\nAn operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs and so on. He recognized that their work is inherently sovereign and free. In commenting on the degree of association that is preferable, Proudhon said: <blockquote>In cases in which production requires great division of labour, it is necessary to form an association among the workers [...] because without that they would remain isolated as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two industrial castes of masters and wage workers, which is repugnant in a free and democratic society. But where the product can be obtained by the action of an individual or a family, [...] there is no opportunity for association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutualism.de/mutu/mutu.htm|title=Some background about the name: What is mutualism?|publisher=Mutualism.de|date=|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor Proudhon, mutualism involved creating industrial democracy, a system where workplaces would be \"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations. [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic\".<ref>Guerin, Daniel (ed.) ''No Gods, No Masters'', AK Press, vol. 1, p. 62</ref> He urged \"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". This would result in \"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\".<ref>''The General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 277, 281</ref> Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.\n\nAs Robert Graham notes: \"Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked to his notions of industrial democracy and workers' self-management\".<ref>\"Introduction\", ''General Idea of the Revolution'', p. xxxii</ref> K. Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that \"Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers\". For Proudhon, \"strong workers' associations [...] would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\".<ref>''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism,'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984, pp. 156, 230</ref>\n\n=== Mutual credit ===\n{{main|Mutual credit}}\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|[[American individualist anarchism|American individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]], whose views on mutual credit causes many to view him as an early mutualist]] \nMutualists argue that [[free banking]] should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on the means of production and landlords have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run [[Mutual savings bank|mutual bank]] or [[credit union]], it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[William Batchelder Greene]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. Some modern forms of mutual credit are [[LETS]] and the [[Ripple monetary system]] project.{{citation needed|reason=Nothing on Ripple page references a mutual credit system. This appears to be a marketing claim.|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed [[income tax]] to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33{{fraction|1|3}} percent and 50 percent, but it was turned down by the legislature.<ref>Anderson, Edwin Robert (1911).

[...] Suppose that by means of this tax a bank be founded, in Competition with the Bank (miscalled) of France, discounting and giving credit on mortgages at the rate of one-half of one per cent\".</ref> Proudhon also argued for the abolition of all taxes.<ref>Cohen, Henry ed. (1927). ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem''. Vanguard Press. p. 46.</ref>\n\n=== Property ===\n[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was one of the most famous philosophers who articulated thoughts on the nature of property. He is known for claiming that \"[[property is theft]]\", but is less known for the claims that \"property is liberty\" and \"property is impossible\".<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What is Property?''</ref> According to [[Colin Ward]], Proudhon did not see a contradiction between these slogans. This was because Proudhon distinguished between what he considered to be two distinct forms of property often bound up in the single label. To the mutualist, this is the distinction between property created by coercion and property created by labor. Property is theft \"when it is related to a landowner or capitalist whose ownership is derived from conquest or exploitation and [is] only maintained through the state, property laws, police, and an army\". Property is freedom for \"the peasant or artisan family [who have] a natural right to a home, land [they may] cultivate, [...] to tools of a trade\" and the fruits of that cultivation\u2014but not to ownership or control of the lands and lives of others. The former is considered illegitimate property, the latter legitimate property.<ref>Ward, Colin (2004). ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''.</ref> Proudhon argued that property in the product of labor is essential to liberty while property that strayed from possession (\"occupancy and use\") was the basis for tyranny and would lead a society to destroy itself. The conception of entitlement property as a destructive force and illegitimate institution can be seen in this quote by Proudhon: <blockquote>Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty, equality, and security, we are not associated for the sake of property; then if property is a natural right, this natural right is not social, but anti-social. Property and society are utterly irreconcilable institutions. It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to join two magnets by their opposite poles. Either society must perish, or it must destroy property. If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable right, why, in all ages, has there been so much speculation as to its origin? \u2013 for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics. The origin of a natural right! Good God! who ever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty, security, or equality?<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What Is Property?''</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nIn ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] says: <blockquote>It is, therefore, one of the purposes of Mutualists, not only to awaken in the people the appreciation of and desire for freedom, but also to arouse in them a determination to abolish the legal restrictions now placed upon non-invasive human activities and to institute, through purely voluntary associations, such measures as will liberate all of us from the exactions of privilege and the power of concentrated capital.<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What Is Mutualism''.</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nSwartz also states that mutualism differs from [[anarcho-communism]] and other collectivist philosophies by its support of private property, arguing: \"One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property\".<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What Is Mutualism?''</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}} However, Proudhon warned that a society with private property would lead to statist relations between people, arguing: <blockquote>The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people [...] will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants.'<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What Is Property?'' p. 118.</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnlike [[capitalist]] private-property supporters, Proudhon stressed equality. He thought that all workers should own property and have access to capital, stressing that in every cooperative \"every worker employed in the association [must have] an undivided share in the property of the company\".<ref>Quoted by James J. Martin. ''Men Against the State''. p. 223.</ref> This distinction Proudhon made between different kinds of property has been articulated by some later anarchist and socialist theorists as one of the first distinctions between [[private property]] and [[personal property]], with the latter having direct [[use-value]] to the individual possessing it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Friedland|first1=William H.|author1-link=William H.

D\u00e9jacque asked: 'Am I thus right to want, as with the system of contracts, to measure out to each\u2014according to their accidental capacity to produce\u2014what they are entitled to?' The answer given by D\u00e9jacque to this question is unambiguous: 'it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.'

Some critics object to the use of the term capitalism in reference to historical or actually existing economic arrangements which they term [[mixed economies]]. They reserve the term for the abstract ideal or future possibility of a genuinely free market. This sort of [[free-market capitalism]] may closely follow contemporary mutualist [[Kevin Carson]]'s [[Left-wing market anarchism|free-market anti-capitalism]] in its practical details, except for the fact that Carson does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has transformed through labor or purchased to be protected when he is not using it. Like other mutualists, Carson only recognize occupancy and use as the standard for retaining legitimate control over something.<ref name=\"Carson p. 200\">Carson, Kevin (28 June 2006).

Reisman sees the seizure of such land as the theft of the product of labor and has said: \"Mutualism claims to oppose the exploitation of labor, i.e. the theft of any part of its product. But when it comes to labor that has been mixed with land, it turns a blind eye out foursquare on the side of the exploiter\".<ref>Reisman, George.

''What Is Property?''. p. 118. \"The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people [...] will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants'\".</ref><ref>Martin, James J. ''Men Against the State''. p. 223.</ref> For mutualists, occupancy and use is \"the only legitimate standard for establishing ownership of land, regardless of how many times it has changed hands\". According to Carson, \"[a]n existing owner may transfer ownership by sale or gift; but the new owner may establish legitimate title to the land only by his own occupancy and use. A change in occupancy will amount to a change in ownership. Absentee landlord rent, and exclusion of homesteaders from vacant land by an absentee landlord, are both considered illegitimate by mutualists. The actual occupant is considered the owner of a tract of land, and any attempt to collect rent by a self-styled landlord is regarded as a violent invasion of the possessor's absolute right of property\".<ref name=\"Carson p. 200\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Anti-capitalism]]\n* [[Distributism]]\n* [[Free-market anarchism]]\n* [[Georgism]]\n* [[Individualist anarchism]]\n* [[Labor theory of property]]\n* [[Labor theory of value]]\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Left-wing market anarchism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[:Category:Mutualists|List of mutualists]]\n* [[Market anarchism]]\n* [[Personal property]]\n* [[Private property]]\n* [[Property is theft!]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n* [[Worker cooperative]]\n* [[Workers' self-management]]\n* [[Workplace democracy]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Backer, Thomas B.

Mutualists disagree with the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Although opposed to this type of income, Proudhon expressed that he had never intended \"to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital.

Bestor, Jr., \"The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary\", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Jun., 1948), 259\u2013302.</ref> although the reference was not to an economic system.

Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements. Broadview Press. p. 100</ref> In ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that \"[t]he word \"mutualism\" seems to have been first used by [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], an English writer, in 1832\".<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism?</ref> When Gray's 1825 ''Lecture on Human Happiness'' was first published in the United States in 1826, the publishers appended the ''Preamble and Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests, Located at Valley Forge''. 1826 also saw the publication of the ''Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests at [[Kendal, Ohio]]''.\n\nBy 1846, Proudhon was speaking of ''mutualit\u00e9'' in his writings and he used the term ''mutuellisme'' at least as early as 1848 in his \"Programme R\u00e9volutionnaire\". In 1850, [[William Batchelder Greene]] used the term mutualism to describe a mutual credit system similar to that of Proudhon. In 1850, the American newspaper ''The Spirit of the Age'', edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a mutualist township by Joshua King Ingalls<ref>Joshua King Ingalls, \"A Practical Movement for Transition,\" Spirit of the Age, II, 13 (March 30, 1850), pp. 202\u201304.</ref> and Albert Brisbane,<ref>Albert Brisbane, \"The Mutualist Township,\" The Spirit of the Age, II, 12 (March 23, 1850), 179\u201383.;  II, 13 (March 30, 1850), 200\u2013202.</ref> together with works by Proudhon,<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, \"The Coming Era of Mutualism,\" ''Spirit of the Age'', I, 7 (August 18, 1849), 107\u201308.</ref> Greene, [[Pierre Leroux]] and others.\n\nProudhon ran for the [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|French Constituent Assembly]] in April 1848, but was not elected, although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille. He was successful in the complementary elections of June 4 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. He was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nProudhon was surprised by the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic. However, he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767\u20131855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849<!-- which month? -->, ''Solution du probl\u00e8me social'' (''Solution of the Social Problem''), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\n=== 19th century United States ===\nMutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. [[Labor notes (currency)|Labor notes]] were first discussed in [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Time Store]] of former [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] member and [[individualist anarchist]] [[Josiah Warren]]. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with [[William Batchelder Greene]], but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, [[Edward Kellogg (economist)|Edward Kellogg]] and William Beck as well as from the land bank tradition.\n\n[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|200px|[[American individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]], one of the individualist anarchists influenced by Proudhon's mutualism]]\nMutualism can in many ways be considered the original [[anarchy]] since [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first to identify himself as an [[anarchist]]. Although mutualism is generally associated with anarchism, it is not necessarily anarchist. Historian [[Wendy McElroy]] reports that [[American individualist anarchism]] received an important influence of three European thinkers. One of the most important of these influences was the French political philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whose words \"Liberty is not the Daughter But the Mother of Order\" appeared as a motto on ''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]''{{'}}s masthead.<ref name=\"mises\">[[Wendy McElroy]].

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]].

For this reason, he demands \"mutuality\" in marriage\u2014the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property\".<ref name=\"againstallauthority.org\"/>\n\nTucker later connected his economic views with those of Proudhon, Warren and [[Karl Marx]], taking sides with the first two while also arguing against American anti-socialists who declared socialism as imported, stating: {{quote|The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his \"Wealth of Nations,\" \u2013 namely, that labor is the true measure of price. [...] Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy. [...] This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew.

According to [[George Woodcock]], \"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\".<ref>George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'': \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or [[Cantonalism|cantonalist]], political system on Proudhonian lines\".<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as ''La reacci\u00f3n y la revoluci\u00f3n'' (''Reaction and Revolution'' from 1855), ''Las nacionalidades'' (''Nationalities'' from 1877) and ''La Federaci\u00f3n'' (''The Federation'' from 1880). For prominent [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Rudolf Rocker]], \"[t]he first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi y Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi y Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of [[Richard Price]], [[Joseph Priestly]] [''sic''], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period.

M. Stekloff, in April 1856 \"arrived from Paris a deputation of Proudhonist workers whose aim it was to bring about the foundation of a Universal League of Workers. The object of the League was the social emancipation of the working class, which, it was held, could only be achieved by a union of the workers of all lands against international capital. Since the deputation was one of Proudhonists, of course this emancipation was to be secured, not by political methods, but purely by economic means, through the foundation of productive and distributive co-operatives\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch02.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]</ref> Stekloff continues by saying that \"[i]t was in the 1863 elections that for the first time workers' candidates were run in opposition to bourgeois republicans, but they secured very few votes. [...] [A] group of working-class Proudhonists (among whom were Murat and Tolain, who were subsequently to participate in the founding of the (First) International issued the famous Manifesto of the Sixty, which, though extremely moderate in tone, marked a turning point in the history of the French movement. For years and years the bourgeois liberals had been insisting that the revolution of 1789 had abolished class distinctions. The Manifesto of the Sixty loudly proclaimed that classes still existed. These classes were the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The latter had its specific class interests, which none but workers could be trusted to defend. The inference drawn by the Manifesto was that there must be independent working-class candidates\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch03.htm History of The First International by G. M. Stekloff. London. Martin Lawrence Limited]</ref>\n\nFor Stekloff, \"the Proudhonists, who were at that date the leaders of the French section of the International. They looked upon the International Workingmen's Association as a sort of academy or synagogue, where Talmudists or similar experts could \"investigate\" the workers' problem; wherein the spirit of Proudhon they could excogitate means for an accurate solution of the problem, without being disturbed by the stresses of a political campaign. Thus Fribourg, voicing the opinions of the Parisian group of the Proudhonists (Tolain and Co.) assured his readers that \"the International was the greatest attempt ever made in modern times to aid the proletariat towards the conquest, by peaceful, constitutional, and moral methods, of the place which rightly belongs to the workers in the sunshine of civilisation\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch04.htm History of The First International by G.

Carson's thesis is that an authentic [[free-market]] economy would not be capitalism as the separation of labor from ownership and the subordination of labor to capital would be impossible, bringing a classless society where people could easily choose between working as a freelancer, working for a [[Living wage|fair wage]], taking part of a cooperative, or being an entrepreneur. As did [[Benjamin Tucker]] before him, he notes that a mutualist free-market system would involve significantly different property rights than capitalism is based on, particularly in terms of land and intellectual property.<ref>Caron, Kevin (2001).

Retrieved 19 December 2019.</ref>\n\n== Theory ==\n{{see also|Cost the limit of price}}\nThe primary aspects of mutualism are [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]], reciprocity and gradualism, or dual power. Mutualism is often described by its proponents as advocating an anti-capitalist free market. Mutualists argue that most of the economic problems associated with capitalism each amount to a violation of the cost principle, or as [[Josiah Warren]] interchangeably said, the cost the limit of price. It was inspired by the [[labor theory of value]] which was popularized\u2014although not invented\u2014by [[Adam Smith]] in 1776 (Proudhon mentioned Smith as an inspiration). The labor theory of value holds that the actual price of a thing (or the true cost) is the amount of labor that was undertaken to produce it. In Warren's terms, cost should be the limit of price, with cost referring to the amount of labor required to produce a good or service. Anyone who sells goods should charge no more than the cost to himself of acquiring these goods.\n\n=== Contract and federation ===\nMutualism holds that producers should exchange their goods at cost-value using systems of contract. While Proudhon's early definitions of cost-value were based on fixed assumptions about the value of labor-hours, he later redefined cost-value to include other factors such as the intensity of labor, the nature of the work involved and so on. He also expanded his notions of contract into expanded notions of federation. As Proudhon argued: {{quote|I have shown the contractor, at the birth of industry, negotiating on equal terms with his comrades, who have since become his workmen. It is plain, in fact, that this original equality was bound to disappear through the advantageous position of the master and the dependent position of the wage-workers. In vain does the law assure the right of each to enterprise. [...] When an establishment has had leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can a workman do against a power so superior?<ref>System of Economical Contradictions, p. 202</ref>}}\n\n=== Gradualism and dual power ===\n{{main|Dual power}}\nDual power is the process of building alternative institutions to the ones that already exist in modern society. Originally theorized by Proudhon, it has become adopted by many anti-state movements like [[autonomism]] and [[agorism]]. Proudhon described it as such: <blockquote>Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political institutions, out of the sight of statemen and priests, society is producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy.<ref>Proudhon, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.'' Translated by John Beverly Robinson. New York: Haskell House Publishers, Ltd., 1923, 1969 [1851]. p. 243.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDual power should not be confused with the dual power popularized by [[Vladimir Lenin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}</ref> as it was also theorized by Proudhon<ref>{{cite book|first=Murray|last=Bookchin|title=The Third Revolution: Popular Movements in the Revolutionary Era|volume=2|publisher=A&C Black|year=1996|page=115|quote=Proudhon made the bright suggestion, in his periodical ''Le Repr\u00e9sentant du peuple'' (April 28, 1848), that the mass democracy of the clubs could become a popular forum where the social agenda of the revolution could be prepared for use by the [[Constituent Assembly]]\u2014a proposal that would essentially have defused the potency of the clubs as a potentially rebellious dual power.}}</ref> and it refers to a more specific scenario where a revolutionary entity intentionally maintains the structure of the previous political institutions until the power of the previous institution is weakened enough such that the revolutionary entity can overtake it entirely. Dual power as implemented by mutualists and agorists is the development of the alternative institution itself.\n\n=== Free association ===\n{{main|Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|l1=Free association}}\nMutualists argue that association is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other\u2014and without association they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave.\n\nAn operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs and so on. He recognized that their work is inherently sovereign and free. In commenting on the degree of association that is preferable, Proudhon said: <blockquote>In cases in which production requires great division of labour, it is necessary to form an association among the workers [...] because without that they would remain isolated as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two industrial castes of masters and wage workers, which is repugnant in a free and democratic society. But where the product can be obtained by the action of an individual or a family, [...] there is no opportunity for association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutualism.de/mutu/mutu.htm|title=Some background about the name: What is mutualism?|publisher=Mutualism.de|date=|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor Proudhon, mutualism involved creating industrial democracy, a system where workplaces would be \"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations. [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic\".<ref>Guerin, Daniel (ed.) ''No Gods, No Masters'', AK Press, vol. 1, p. 62</ref> He urged \"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". This would result in \"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\".<ref>''The General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 277, 281</ref> Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.\n\nAs Robert Graham notes: \"Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked to his notions of industrial democracy and workers' self-management\".<ref>\"Introduction\", ''General Idea of the Revolution'', p. xxxii</ref> K. Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that \"Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers\". For Proudhon, \"strong workers' associations [...] would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\".<ref>''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism,'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984, pp. 156, 230</ref>\n\n=== Mutual credit ===\n{{main|Mutual credit}}\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|[[American individualist anarchism|American individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]], whose views on mutual credit causes many to view him as an early mutualist]] \nMutualists argue that [[free banking]] should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on the means of production and landlords have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run [[Mutual savings bank|mutual bank]] or [[credit union]], it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[William Batchelder Greene]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. Some modern forms of mutual credit are [[LETS]] and the [[Ripple monetary system]] project.{{citation needed|reason=Nothing on Ripple page references a mutual credit system. This appears to be a marketing claim.|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed [[income tax]] to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33{{fraction|1|3}} percent and 50 percent, but it was turned down by the legislature.<ref>Anderson, Edwin Robert (1911).

[...] Suppose that by means of this tax a bank be founded, in Competition with the Bank (miscalled) of France, discounting and giving credit on mortgages at the rate of one-half of one per cent\".</ref> Proudhon also argued for the abolition of all taxes.<ref>Cohen, Henry ed. (1927). ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem''. Vanguard Press. p. 46.</ref>\n\n=== Property ===\n[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was one of the most famous philosophers who articulated thoughts on the nature of property. He is known for claiming that \"[[property is theft]]\", but is less known for the claims that \"property is liberty\" and \"property is impossible\".<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What is Property?''</ref> According to [[Colin Ward]], Proudhon did not see a contradiction between these slogans. This was because Proudhon distinguished between what he considered to be two distinct forms of property often bound up in the single label. To the mutualist, this is the distinction between property created by coercion and property created by labor. Property is theft \"when it is related to a landowner or capitalist whose ownership is derived from conquest or exploitation and [is] only maintained through the state, property laws, police, and an army\". Property is freedom for \"the peasant or artisan family [who have] a natural right to a home, land [they may] cultivate, [...] to tools of a trade\" and the fruits of that cultivation\u2014but not to ownership or control of the lands and lives of others. The former is considered illegitimate property, the latter legitimate property.<ref>Ward, Colin (2004). ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''.</ref> Proudhon argued that property in the product of labor is essential to liberty while property that strayed from possession (\"occupancy and use\") was the basis for tyranny and would lead a society to destroy itself. The conception of entitlement property as a destructive force and illegitimate institution can be seen in this quote by Proudhon: <blockquote>Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty, equality, and security, we are not associated for the sake of property; then if property is a natural right, this natural right is not social, but anti-social. Property and society are utterly irreconcilable institutions. It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to join two magnets by their opposite poles. Either society must perish, or it must destroy property. If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable right, why, in all ages, has there been so much speculation as to its origin? \u2013 for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics. The origin of a natural right! Good God! who ever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty, security, or equality?<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What Is Property?''</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nIn ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] says: <blockquote>It is, therefore, one of the purposes of Mutualists, not only to awaken in the people the appreciation of and desire for freedom, but also to arouse in them a determination to abolish the legal restrictions now placed upon non-invasive human activities and to institute, through purely voluntary associations, such measures as will liberate all of us from the exactions of privilege and the power of concentrated capital.<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What Is Mutualism''.</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nSwartz also states that mutualism differs from [[anarcho-communism]] and other collectivist philosophies by its support of private property, arguing: \"One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property\".<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What Is Mutualism?''</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}} However, Proudhon warned that a society with private property would lead to statist relations between people, arguing: <blockquote>The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people [...] will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants.'<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What Is Property?'' p. 118.</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnlike [[capitalist]] private-property supporters, Proudhon stressed equality. He thought that all workers should own property and have access to capital, stressing that in every cooperative \"every worker employed in the association [must have] an undivided share in the property of the company\".<ref>Quoted by James J. Martin.

According to Pengam, D\u00e9jacque criticized Proudhon as far as \"the Proudhonist version of Ricardian socialism, centred on the reward of labour power and the problem of exchange value. In his polemic with Proudhon on women's emancipation, D\u00e9jacque urged Proudhon to push on 'as far as the abolition of the contract, the abolition not only of the sword and of capital, but of property and authority in all their forms,' and refuted the commercial and wages logic of the demand for a 'fair reward' for 'labour' (labour power). D\u00e9jacque asked: 'Am I thus right to want, as with the system of contracts, to measure out to each\u2014according to their accidental capacity to produce\u2014what they are entitled to?' The answer given by D\u00e9jacque to this question is unambiguous: 'it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.' [...] For D\u00e9jacque, on the other hand, the communal state of affairs\u2014the phalanstery 'without any hierarchy, without any authority' except that of the 'statistics book'\u2014corresponded to 'natural exchange,' i.e. to the 'unlimited freedom of all production and consumption; the abolition of any sign of agricultural, individual, artistic or scientific property; the destruction of any individual holding of the products of work; the demonarchisation and the demonetarisation of manual and intellectual capital as well as capital in instruments, commerce and buildings.\"</ref> In his critique of Proudhon, D\u00e9jacque also coined the word libertarian and argued that Proudhon was merely a liberal, a moderate, suggesting him to become \"frankly and completely an anarchist\" instead by giving up all forms of authority and property.<ref>The [[An Anarchist FAQ|Anarchist FAQ]] Editorial Collective (2017).

In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph D\u00e9jacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sebastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists\".</ref>\n\nOne area of disagreement between [[anarcho-communists]] and mutualists stems from Proudhon's alleged advocacy of [[labour voucher]]s to compensate individuals for their labor as well as markets or [[artificial market]]s for goods and services.<ref>The persistent claim that Proudhon proposed a labor currency has been challenged as a misunderstanding or misrepresentation. See, for example, McKay, Iain. \"Proudhon\u2019s Constituted Value and the Myth of Labour Notes.\" Anarchist Studies. Spring 2017.</ref> [[Peter Kropotkin]], like other anarcho-communists, advocated the abolition of labor remuneration and questioned \"how can this new form of wages, the [[Labour voucher|labor note]], be sanctioned by those who admit that houses, fields, mills are no longer private property, that they belong to the commune or the nation?\".<ref>Kropotkin, Peter. [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-wage-system The Wage System, Freedom Pamphlets No. 1, New Edition 1920]</ref> According to [[George Woodcock]], Kropotkin believed that a wage system in any form, whether \"administered by Banks of the People or by workers' associations through [[Labour voucher|labor cheques]]\", is a form of compulsion.<ref>Woodcock, George (2004). ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. Broadview Press. p. 168.</ref>\n\n[[Collectivist anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]] was an adamant critic of Proudhonian mutualism as well,<ref>Bookchin, Murray. [[The Spanish Anarchists]]. AK Press. 1996. p. 25</ref> stating: \"How ridiculous are the ideas of the individualists of the Jean Jacques Rousseau school and of the Proudhonian mutualists who conceive society as the result of the free contract of individuals absolutely independent of one another and entering into mutual relations only because of the convention drawn up among men. As if these men had dropped from the skies, bringing with them speech, will, original thought, and as if they were alien to anything of the earth, that is, anything having social origin\".<ref>Cited in Bookchin, Murray (1995).

''Political Philosophy of Bakunin''. p. 167.</ref>\n\n=== Capitalism ===\nCriticism from pro-capitalist market sectors has been common as well. Some critics object to the use of the term capitalism in reference to historical or actually existing economic arrangements which they term [[mixed economies]]. They reserve the term for the abstract ideal or future possibility of a genuinely free market. This sort of [[free-market capitalism]] may closely follow contemporary mutualist [[Kevin Carson]]'s [[Left-wing market anarchism|free-market anti-capitalism]] in its practical details, except for the fact that Carson does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has transformed through labor or purchased to be protected when he is not using it. Like other mutualists, Carson only recognize occupancy and use as the standard for retaining legitimate control over something.<ref name=\"Carson p. 200\">Carson, Kevin (28 June 2006). ''Mutualist Political Economy''. BookSurge Publishing. p. 200. {{ISBN|978-1419658693}}.</ref> As a result, [[Austrian School]] economist and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[George Reisman]] charges that mutualism supports exploitation when it does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has mixed his labor with if he happens to not be using it. Reisman sees the seizure of such land as the theft of the product of labor and has said: \"Mutualism claims to oppose the exploitation of labor, i.e. the theft of any part of its product. But when it comes to labor that has been mixed with land, it turns a blind eye out foursquare on the side of the exploiter\".<ref>Reisman, George. [http://blog.mises.org/archives/005219.asp \"Mutualism's Support for the Exploitation of Labor and State Coercion\"].</ref>\n\nThis is due to the different conception of property rights between capitalism and mutualism, with the latter supporting free access to capital, the means of production and natural resources, arguing that permanent private ownership of land and capital entails to monopolization, if there is not the [[equal liberty]] of access; and that a society with capitalist private property inevitably lead to statist relations between people.<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''What Is Property?''. p. 118. \"The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people [...] will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants'\".</ref><ref>Martin, James J. ''Men Against the State''. p. 223.</ref> For mutualists, occupancy and use is \"the only legitimate standard for establishing ownership of land, regardless of how many times it has changed hands\". According to Carson, \"[a]n existing owner may transfer ownership by sale or gift; but the new owner may establish legitimate title to the land only by his own occupancy and use. A change in occupancy will amount to a change in ownership. Absentee landlord rent, and exclusion of homesteaders from vacant land by an absentee landlord, are both considered illegitimate by mutualists. The actual occupant is considered the owner of a tract of land, and any attempt to collect rent by a self-styled landlord is regarded as a violent invasion of the possessor's absolute right of property\".<ref name=\"Carson p. 200\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Anti-capitalism]]\n* [[Distributism]]\n* [[Free-market anarchism]]\n* [[Georgism]]\n* [[Individualist anarchism]]\n* [[Labor theory of property]]\n* [[Labor theory of value]]\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Left-wing market anarchism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[:Category:Mutualists|List of mutualists]]\n* [[Market anarchism]]\n* [[Personal property]]\n* [[Private property]]\n* [[Property is theft!]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n* [[Worker cooperative]]\n* [[Workers' self-management]]\n* [[Workplace democracy]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Backer, Thomas B.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972).

Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]].

The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans).

This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31\u201353 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}. After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points. Subsequent wins over {{AFL Fre}}, {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Haw}} saw the Swans sit second behind {{AFL WC}} on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).\n\nThe Swans defeated {{AFL Ade}} by 29 points in their qualifying final at [[AAMI Stadium]], thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated {{AFL Col}} by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.\n\nIn the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn [[2012 AFL Grand Final|by ten points]] in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with [[Nick Malceski]] kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005.

After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans' won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 grand finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/sport/2014/07/12/dozen-unstoppable-sydney-swans/|title=Dozen up for unstoppable Swans \u2013 The New Daily|date=12 July 2014|publisher=}}</ref> and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}</ref> The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.\n\nThe Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015</ref> Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015</ref> The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.\n\nThe Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap \u2013 thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au \u2013 Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref> It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014</ref> The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke.

The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev. Michael J. Shea and John F. Shea. In 1961, the school and other musical houses granted South Melbourne a copyright to adapt the ''Victory March'' into the new club song, which replaced an adaptation of ''[[Springtime in the Rockies (1937 film)|Springtime in the Rockies]]'' by [[Gene Autry]].<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/club/our-club/club-song Sydney Swans Club Song] SydneySwans.com.au</ref> Port Adelaide also has used the ''Victory March'' as the basis for their club song since 1971, though their senior team changed their club song to their current original ''Power To Win'' after their entry into the AFL.\n\nGeorge Gershwin's ''[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]'' (1919) was used by the club in marketing promotions during the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Swans mascot.jpg|thumb|Syd 'Swannie' Skilton, Sydney Swans Mascot Manor mascot]]The Sydney Swans' mascot for the [[Mascot Manor|AFL's Mascot Manor]] is Syd 'Swannie' Skilton.\nHe is named after Swans legend [[Bob Skilton]].

The rivalry was highlighted by Sydney's four-point win against West Coast in the [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005 Grand Final]], and West Coast's one-point win against Sydney in the [[2006 AFL Grand Final|2006 Grand Final]].\n\n===Hawthorn===\n\nThe rivalry with [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] has been more recent, mostly defined by two grand finals ([[2012 AFL Grand Final|2012]] and [[2014 AFL Grand Final|2014]]). The Swans beat Hawthorn in 2012 by 10 points to claim their fifth premiership. The rivalry grew in 2013, when Hawthorn forward Lance Franklin transferred to the Swans as a free agent on a nine-year, $10&nbsp;million deal. In 2014, the Swans finished minor premiers and were favourites to win the grand final, however Hawthorn beat Sydney by 63 points.

Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2018}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox Australian football club\n|color1 = #ED171F\n|color2 = white\n|color3 = solid white\n| clubname  = Sydney Swans\n| image     = Sydney Swans Logo.svg\n| image_size      = 125px\n| caption   = \n| fullname  = Sydney Swans Limited<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/adf.task-flow?adf.tfId=panelSearch&adf.tfDoc=/taskflows/panelSearch.xml&searchText=063349708&searchType=OrgAndBusNm|title=ASIC Registry Search}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/SydneySwans/Club%20HQ/Swans%20Constitution.pdf|title=Sydney Swans Constitution|access-date=24 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916123719/http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/SydneySwans/Club%20HQ/Swans%20Constitution.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| formernames = South Melbourne Football Club<br/>(1874\u20131982)<br />Swans Football Club<br/>(1982)<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Sydney_part_2.htm Sydney \u2013 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107085620/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Sydney_part_2.htm |date=7 January 2009 }} \u2013 FullPointsFooty.

Established in [[Melbourne]] as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' in 1874, the Swans relocated to [[Sydney]] in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nInitially playing in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896. It won premierships in [[1909 VFL Grand Final|1909]], [[1918 VFL Grand Final|1918]] and [[1933 VFL Grand Final|1933]] before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought\u2014the longest in the competition's history. The club broke the drought in [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005]] and won another premiership in [[2012 AFL season|2012]].\n\nThe club has proven to be one of the most consistent teams in the AFL era, failing to make the finals in only four seasons since [[1995 AFL season|1995]], playing the most number of finals matches and winning the second-most matches overall (only behind {{AFL Gee}}) since 2000 and boasting a finals winning record of over 50% in the same time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKBlqPdAo0WO-F_PQzFLuRX-TDz7xsg7TFb-gQ1C3F0/pubhtml?gid=388289766&single=true|title=AFL Finals Summary All Clubs 2000\u20132015|accessdate=9 November 2015|location=Google Docs|first=Justin|last=Mitchell|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-02-06/which-was-the-best-club-since-2000|title=Which was the best club since 2000?|work=Staff writers|publisher=Australian Football League|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Swans' headquarters and training facilities are located at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], the club's playing home ground since 1982.\n\n==South Melbourne history==\n[[File:Smfc.png|thumb|Old South Melbourne Football Club shield.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972). From left to right those represented are: [[Jack Bisset]], the team's captain; [[Dick Mullaly]], the club's secretary; [[Brighton Diggins]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Bert Beard]], from South Fremantle (WAFL); [[Bill Faul]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jim O'Meara]], from East Perth (WAFL); [[Frank Davies (footballer, born 1907)|Frank Davies]], from City (NTFA); [[Laurie Nash]], from City (NTFA); [[John Bowe (footballer)|John Bowe]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jack Wade (footballer)|Jack Wade]], from Port Adelaide (SANFL); [[Ossie Bertram]], from West Torrens (SANFL); and [[Wilbur Harris]], from West Torrens (SANFL).</ref>\n\nOn grand final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] wound down,<ref>Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]</ref> while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson (Australian footballer)|Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.\n\nAttendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=35%\n|align=right\n|quote=Nick Davis!

This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31\u201353 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign.\n\nThe conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of [[Adam Schneider]] and [[Sean Dempster]] to [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the delisting of [[Simon Phillips (footballer)|Simon Phillips]], Jonathan Simpkin and [[Luke Vogels]], and the gain of [[Henry Playfair]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Martin Mattner]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]].\n\n[[File:Sydney banner honouring Amon Buchanon and Paul Roos.jpg|thumb|A Sydney Swans banner honouring Amon Buchanon's 100th game as a player [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]]' 500th game as player and coach]]\n\nThe Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated {{AFL Nor}} in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week.\n\n2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994.

The club defeated {{AFL Car}} by five points in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons.

The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}.

The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137).

For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.\n\nThe Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap \u2013 thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au \u2013 Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref> It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014</ref> The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev.

Both teams have had close games since their grand final encounters, with their matches often finishing within single digit margins.\n\n==VFL and AFL premierships==\n\n===Premiers===\n* 1909 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Carlton 4.14 (38) to 4.12 (36)\n* 1918 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Collingwood 9.8 (62) to 7.15 (57)\n* 1933 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Richmond 9.17 (71) to 4.5 (29)\n* 2005 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated West Coast 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54)\n* 2012 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated Hawthorn 14.7 (91) to 11.15 (81)\n\n===Defeated in grand finals===\n* 1899 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Fitzroy 3.9 (27) to 3.8 (26)\n* 1907 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.14 (50) to 6.9 (45)\n* 1912 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Essendon 5.17 (47) to 4.9 (33)\n* 1914 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.9 (45) to 4.15 (39)\n* 1934 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Richmond 19.14 (128) to 12.17 (89)\n* 1935 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.12 (78) to 7.16 (58)\n* 1936 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.23 (89) to 10.18 (78)\n* 1945 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 15.13 (103) to 10.15 (75)\n* 1996 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by North Melbourne 19.17 (131) to 13.10 (88); first grand final appearance after relocation\n* 2006 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by West Coast 12.13 (85) to 12.12 (84)\n* 2014 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Hawthorn 21.11 (137) to 11.8 (74)\n* 2016 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Western Bulldogs 13.11 (89) to 10.7 (67)\n\n==Players and staff==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Sydney Swans current squad}}\n\n===Officials===\n* '''Chairman:''' [[Andrew Pridham]]\n* '''Directors:'''\n** Andrew McMaster (Deputy chairman)\n** Rob Morgan\n** Alexandra Goodfellow\n** Greg Paramor\n** Robert Pascoe\n** Brian Tyson\n** Brad Seymour\n** Tim Worner\n* '''Chief executive:''' [[Tom Harley]]\n* '''general manager \u2013 Football:''' [[Charlie Gardiner (footballer)|Charlie Gardiner]]\n* '''Player Welfare & Development:''' [[Dennis Carroll]]\n\n==Reserves team==\n{{Main|Australian Football League reserves affiliations}}\nThe Swans currently field a reserves team in the [[North East Australian Football League]]. Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

(SAFF)\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n===Print===\n\nThe Sydney Swans receive regular exposure from Sydney's two major daily newspapers, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]], the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans"}

It was named the \"North Auckland Rugby Union\" from its founding in 1920 until 1994.\n\n==History==\nRugby was first played in Northland in the 1870s, and the first union was set up in the province in 1895, known as the Marsden Football Union.<ref name=\"Sports and Leisure in Northland\">[http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Northland/Northland/14/en Sports and Leisure in Northland]</ref> The Northland union was founded in 1920, as North Auckland Rugby Union. It formed when the Whangarei Rugby Union applied to the New Zealand Union to have the areas controlled by the Whangarei, Northern Wairoa, Bay of Islands, Otamatea and Hokianga sub-unions combined as a major union.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Arthur C. Swan, ''History of New Zealand Rugby Football 1870\u20131945'', 1948</ref> This application was granted in 1921.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RugbyUnionFootball/History/en Rugby Beginnings in New Zealand]</ref> In 1989 the Omaha, Warkworth and Kaipara Flats clubs merged to become the Mahurangi club and switched from the North Auckland union to the [[North Harbour Rugby Union]]. In 1994, North Auckland changed its name to the Northland Rugby Football Union.<ref name=\"Sports and Leisure in Northland\"/>\n\nNorth Auckland played their first ever match as union on August 3, 1920, in an 11-0 victory over South Island Country. However, they did not play their first 'inter-union' match until July 27, 1922 - an 8-6 loss at the hands of Auckland in Whangarei. Their first 'inter-union' win came on August 30, 1923, when they beat King Country 20-8<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Northland Taniwha.png|thumb|right|125px|Northland Taniwha.]] -->\n\n==Ranfurly Shield==\nNorthland, as North Auckland, have held the Shield on only four occasions - 1950, 1960, 1971 and 1978. However, they have been a part of a couple of the most memorable moments in Shield History.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lindsay Knight, ''Shield Fever'', 1980</ref>\n\nNorthland's first ever challenge came on July 3, 1935. The 126th Ranfurly Shield match. Northland lost this challenge comprehensively, 29-8, to Auckland.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nNorthland first won the Shield in 1950, with a 20-9 win over South Canterbury. However, their reign lasted only three games, as Waikato took it off them with a 6-3 win. Almost 10 years passed before Northland won the Shield again, beating Auckland 24-11 in 1960. Their defense of the Shield this time around was not any better, losing it back to Auckland only 11 days later.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Ron Palenski, Rod Chester, Neville McMillan, ''The Encyclopedia of New Zealand Rugby, 4th Edition'', 2005</ref>\n\nMore than 10 years passed before Northland would win the Shield for a third time. On this occasion, they beat Auckland 17-12, in 1971. This Shield-winning side fared much better than their predecessors. They managed six successful defenses before losing the Shield back to Auckland in 1972, in what is commonly regarded as the most famous rugby match in Northland history.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> \"Ranfurly Shield Fever\" hit the city of Whangarei hard before this encounter. One memorable sign was erected on Whangarei's main street on the morning of the match, reading: \"Northland vs South Northland\". While another sign, erected just south of Whangarei, read: \"You are now entering  Ranfurly Shield Country\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> When game-time arrived, a staggering 40,000 people crammed into Whangarei's Okara Park. An amazing number considering, at the time, Whangarei was a city of only 34,000 people, and Okara Park's capacity seating was not near 40,000.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Despite Northland losing the match 16-15, it is seen as a monumental, and proud moment in Northland rugby history.\n\n===Incensing a nation===\n\nNorthland's fourth, and final, Shield victory came in 1978, with a 12-10 win over Manawatu.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Northland only managed to win this game by scoring a penalty goal a few minutes after what should have been full-time. Although the Manawatu supporters were livid with what they had just witnessed, what was to follow severely dented the reputation of Northland rugby for years to come.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Northland, after regaining the Shield, were to finish their season with two home fixtures against Southland and Otago. Being home matches, everyone assumed they would be Shield defenses, but to the astonishment of the Southland and Otago unions, Northland refused to put the Shield on the line for these matches.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Both Southland and Otago took the case to the New Zealand union's appeal committee, but to no avail.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Rage towards the Northland union spread throughout the country, even within its own province. Ted Griffin, who coached Northland to its previous Shield wins, boycotted Northlands home matches, but visited the Southland and Otago teams to offer his condolences.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nNorthland proceeded to defend the Shield successfully five times in the 1979 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> However, very few cared.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Many people - players, officials, fans etc. - had lost a lot of respect for the Northland union due to the way they ended the 1978 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Although they lost the Shield on their 6th defense, to who else but Auckland, Northland had left a bad taste in peoples mouths for the next few years to come.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Representative rugby==\n{{Infobox rugby team \n  | teamname = Northland\n  | image    =  \n  | nickname = ''[[Taniwha]]'', ''Cambridge Blues''  \n  | founded  = {{Start date and age|1920}}\n  | region = [[Northland Region|Northland]]\n  | ground   = [[Okara Park]], [[Whangarei]] \n  | capacity = 30,000 \n  | CEO = [[Jim Smylie]]\n  | coach  = [[Derren Witcombe]]\n  | captain =[[Matt Moulds]]\n  | url     = http://www.taniwha.co.nz/\n  | league     = [[Mitre 10 Cup]]\n  | season     = [[2019 Mitre 10 Cup|2019]]\n  | position   = 6th In Championship\n  | pattern_la1=_GFCA1213a\n  | pattern_b1 =_whitethinlines\n  | pattern_ra1=_GFCA1213a\n  | pattern_sh1 =_thinblue stripes\n  | pattern_so1 =_3_stripes_white\n  | leftarm1   =6699DD\n  | body1      =6699DD\n  | rightarm1  =6699DD\n  | shorts1    =FFFFFF\n  | socks1     =6699DD\n  | pattern_la2=|pattern_b2=|pattern_ra2=|leftarm2=|body2=|rightarm2=|shorts2=|socks2=\n}}\n\nPast representative players of the North Auckland and Northland Union have the right to belong to the New Zealand Vikings Rugby Football Club should they wish to do so.

This was due to the preponderance of All Blacks (players representing New Zealand) who came from North Harbour, Counties-Manukau and Auckland at the time. Hence if the Blues were to consist of these unions, they would field an All Blacks team in all but name.\n\nThis led to North Harbour and Northland being represented by the nearest other team, the [[Chiefs (Super rugby franchise)|Chiefs]] (at the time named the Waikato Chiefs).\n\n====Blues 1999\u2013present====\nBy the end of the 1990s the number of All Blacks from these unions had decreased. This led the Blues and the Chiefs to arrange a swap, where the Chiefs would represent Thames Valley and Counties Manukau in exchange for the Blues representing Northland and North Harbour.\n\n==Sub-Unions==\nDue to the large size of the Northland province, the Northland rugby union is divided into 7 sub-unions. Each sub-union represents a number of rugby clubs.\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* [[Bay of Islands]]\n* [[Hokianga]]\n|\n* [[Mangonui]]\n* [[Dargaville|Northern

including the northernmost part of the [[Auckland Region|Auckland local government region]]. It was named the \"North Auckland Rugby Union\" from its founding in 1920 until 1994.\n\n==History==\nRugby was first played in Northland in the 1870s, and the first union was set up in the province in 1895, known as the Marsden Football Union.<ref name=\"Sports and Leisure in Northland\">[http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Northland/Northland/14/en Sports and Leisure in Northland]</ref> The Northland union was founded in 1920, as North Auckland Rugby Union. It formed when the Whangarei Rugby Union applied to the New Zealand Union to have the areas controlled by the Whangarei, Northern Wairoa, Bay of Islands, Otamatea and Hokianga sub-unions combined as a major union.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Arthur C. Swan, ''History of New Zealand Rugby Football 1870\u20131945'', 1948</ref> This application was granted in 1921.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RugbyUnionFootball/History/en Rugby Beginnings in New Zealand]</ref> In 1989 the Omaha, Warkworth and Kaipara Flats clubs merged to become the Mahurangi club and switched from the North Auckland union to the [[North Harbour Rugby Union]]. In 1994, North Auckland changed its name to the Northland Rugby Football Union.<ref name=\"Sports and Leisure in Northland\"/>\n\nNorth Auckland played their first ever match as union on August 3, 1920, in an 11-0 victory over South Island Country. However, they did not play their first 'inter-union' match until July 27, 1922 - an 8-6 loss at the hands of Auckland in Whangarei. Their first 'inter-union' win came on August 30, 1923, when they beat King Country 20-8<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Northland Taniwha.png|thumb|right|125px|Northland Taniwha.]] -->\n\n==Ranfurly Shield==\nNorthland, as North Auckland, have held the Shield on only four occasions - 1950, 1960, 1971 and 1978. However, they have been a part of a couple of the most memorable moments in Shield History.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lindsay Knight, ''Shield Fever'', 1980</ref>\n\nNorthland's first ever challenge came on July 3, 1935. The 126th Ranfurly Shield match. Northland lost this challenge comprehensively, 29-8, to Auckland.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nNorthland first won the Shield in 1950, with a 20-9 win over South Canterbury. However, their reign lasted only three games, as Waikato took it off them with a 6-3 win. Almost 10 years passed before Northland won the Shield again, beating Auckland 24-11 in 1960. Their defense of the Shield this time around was not any better, losing it back to Auckland only 11 days later.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Ron Palenski, Rod Chester, Neville McMillan, ''The Encyclopedia of New Zealand Rugby, 4th Edition'', 2005</ref>\n\nMore than 10 years passed before Northland would win the Shield for a third time. On this occasion, they beat Auckland 17-12, in 1971. This Shield-winning side fared much better than their predecessors. They managed six successful defenses before losing the Shield back to Auckland in 1972, in what is commonly regarded as the most famous rugby match in Northland history.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> \"Ranfurly Shield Fever\" hit the city of Whangarei hard before this encounter. One memorable sign was erected on Whangarei's main street on the morning of the match, reading: \"Northland vs South Northland\". While another sign, erected just south of Whangarei, read: \"You are now entering  Ranfurly Shield Country\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> When game-time arrived, a staggering 40,000 people crammed into Whangarei's Okara Park. An amazing number considering, at the time, Whangarei was a city of only 34,000 people, and Okara Park's capacity seating was not near 40,000.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Despite Northland losing the match 16-15, it is seen as a monumental, and proud moment in Northland rugby history.\n\n===Incensing a nation===\n\nNorthland's fourth, and final, Shield victory came in 1978, with a 12-10 win over Manawatu.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Northland only managed to win this game by scoring a penalty goal a few minutes after what should have been full-time. Although the Manawatu supporters were livid with what they had just witnessed, what was to follow severely dented the reputation of Northland rugby for years to come.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Northland, after regaining the Shield, were to finish their season with two home fixtures against Southland and Otago. Being home matches, everyone assumed they would be Shield defenses, but to the astonishment of the Southland and Otago unions, Northland refused to put the Shield on the line for these matches.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Both Southland and Otago took the case to the New Zealand union's appeal committee, but to no avail.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Rage towards the Northland union spread throughout the country, even within its own province. Ted Griffin, who coached Northland to its previous Shield wins, boycotted Northlands home matches, but visited the Southland and Otago teams to offer his condolences.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nNorthland proceeded to defend the Shield successfully five times in the 1979 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> However, very few cared.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Many people - players, officials, fans etc. - had lost a lot of respect for the Northland union due to the way they ended the 1978 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Although they lost the Shield on their 6th defense, to who else but Auckland, Northland had left a bad taste in peoples mouths for the next few years to come.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Representative rugby==\n{{Infobox rugby team \n  | teamname = Northland\n  | image    =  \n  | nickname = ''[[Taniwha]]'', ''Cambridge Blues''  \n  | founded  = {{Start date and age|1920}}\n  | region = [[Northland Region|Northland]]\n  | ground   = [[Okara Park]], [[Whangarei]] \n  | capacity = 30,000 \n  | CEO = [[Jim Smylie]]\n  | coach  = [[Derren Witcombe]]\n  | captain =[[Matt Moulds]]\n  | url     = http://www.taniwha.co.nz/\n  | league     = [[Mitre 10 Cup]]\n  | season     = [[2019 Mitre 10 Cup|2019]]\n  | position   = 6th In Championship\n  | pattern_la1=_GFCA1213a\n  | pattern_b1 =_whitethinlines\n  | pattern_ra1=_GFCA1213a\n  | pattern_sh1 =_thinblue stripes\n  | pattern_so1 =_3_stripes_white\n  | leftarm1   =6699DD\n  | body1      =6699DD\n  | rightarm1  =6699DD\n  | shorts1    =FFFFFF\n  | socks1     =6699DD\n  | pattern_la2=|pattern_b2=|pattern_ra2=|leftarm2=|body2=|rightarm2=|shorts2=|socks2=\n}}\n\nPast representative players of the North Auckland and Northland Union have the right to belong to the New Zealand Vikings Rugby Football Club should they wish to do so.

This was due to the preponderance of All Blacks (players representing New Zealand) who came from North Harbour, Counties-Manukau and Auckland at the time. Hence if the Blues were to consist of these unions, they would field an All Blacks team in all but name.\n\nThis led to North Harbour and Northland being represented by the nearest other team, the [[Chiefs (Super rugby franchise)|Chiefs]] (at the time named the Waikato Chiefs).\n\n====Blues 1999\u2013present====\nBy the end of the 1990s the number of All Blacks from these unions had decreased. This led the Blues and the Chiefs to arrange a swap, where the Chiefs would represent Thames Valley and Counties Manukau in exchange for the Blues representing Northland and North Harbour.\n\n==Sub-Unions==\nDue to the large size of the Northland province, the Northland rugby union is divided into 7 sub-unions. Each sub-union represents a number of rugby clubs.\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* [[Bay of Islands]]\n* [[Hokianga]]\n|\n* [[Mangonui]]\n* [[Dargaville|Northern

Altogether, he won 63 doubles titles, surpassed only by [[the Bryan brothers]], [[Todd Woodbridge]], [[John McEnroe]] and [[Tom Okker]]. He was also ranked No.1 in Doubles on the ATP Computer for a significant period from 1977 to 1979 when he was aged 37.\n\n== Biography ==\nMcMillan was born in [[Springs, South Africa]].  Aside from his considerable success as a doubles player, he had a singles career with good results mostly in South Africa.\n\nHe played in 38 Grand Slam singles events with a 28 to 38 win/loss record, first playing in 1961 at Wimbledon and last at the first US Open at Flushing Meadows in 1978. His best results in both came at the US Open reaching the quarter finals in 1972 and the last 16 in 1976. Arguably his greatest result was reaching the final of the [[1970 South African Open (tennis)|1970 South African Open]] held at Ellis Park. He beat a raging [[Pancho Gonzales]] in the semi-final before losing to world no.1 [[Rod Laver]] in four sets in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Routs Foe, Wins Tennis Title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RudHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nf8MAAAAIBAJ&dq=laver%20mcmillan%20tennis&pg=3831%2C4732794|work=The Morning Record|date=4 April 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Captures So.

As late as 1979 McMillan reached the quarter-finals of the [[Fischer Open]] in Vienna.\n\nMcMillan continued to play the tour for many years. In doubles, he played his last Wimbledon with [[Bob Hewitt]] in 1979 reaching the semi-finals. They made a last appearance together in the main draw at Flushing Meadows in 1980 reaching the quarter-finals with a nostalgic victory over fellow veteran Americans [[Clark Graebner]] and [[Charlie Pasarell]]. McMillan won his last tour title at the 1982 South African Open with [[Brian Gottfried]].\n\nMcMillan played for many years on the seniors tours and was runner-up at the inaugural \"Wimbledon over 35's\" to [[John Newcombe]] in 1982 after good wins against [[Tony Roche]], [[Mark Cox (tennis)|Mark Cox]] and [[Ismail El Shafei]]. In 1988 he and Hewitt, older by 20 years between them, beat the Gullikson twins Tim and Tom in the 35's doubles final at Wimbledon.\n\nThe most notable aspect of his game was that he had both a two-handed backhand and forehand, which increased his power while restricting his mobility.  In the 1967 Wimbledon, he and Hewitt did not lose a set, and McMillan did not once lose a service game.\n\nMcMillan was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, in 1992. He now works as a tennis commentator for [[Eurosport]] and on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC Radio 5]] during [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].\n\n== Grand Prix Championship Series singles finals

championships including three [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]s with [[Bob Hewitt]]. Altogether, he won 63 doubles titles, surpassed only by [[the Bryan brothers]], [[Todd Woodbridge]], [[John McEnroe]] and [[Tom Okker]]. He was also ranked No.1 in Doubles on the ATP Computer for a significant period from 1977 to 1979 when he was aged 37.\n\n== Biography ==\nMcMillan was born in [[Springs, South Africa]].  Aside from his considerable success as a doubles player, he had a singles career with good results mostly in South Africa.\n\nHe played in 38 Grand Slam singles events with a 28 to 38 win/loss record, first playing in 1961 at Wimbledon and last at the first US Open at Flushing Meadows in 1978. His best results in both came at the US Open reaching the quarter finals in 1972 and the last 16 in 1976. Arguably his greatest result was reaching the final of the [[1970 South African Open (tennis)|1970 South African Open]] held at Ellis Park. He beat a raging [[Pancho Gonzales]] in the semi-final before losing to world no.1 [[Rod Laver]] in four sets in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Routs Foe, Wins Tennis Title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RudHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nf8MAAAAIBAJ&dq=laver%20mcmillan%20tennis&pg=3831%2C4732794|work=The Morning Record|date=4 April 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Captures So.

As late as 1979 McMillan reached the quarter-finals of the [[Fischer Open]] in Vienna.\n\nMcMillan continued to play the tour for many years. In doubles, he played his last Wimbledon with [[Bob Hewitt]] in 1979 reaching the semi-finals. They made a last appearance together in the main draw at Flushing Meadows in 1980 reaching the quarter-finals with a nostalgic victory over fellow veteran Americans [[Clark Graebner]] and [[Charlie Pasarell]]. McMillan won his last tour title at the 1982 South African Open with [[Brian Gottfried]].\n\nMcMillan played for many years on the seniors tours and was runner-up at the inaugural \"Wimbledon over 35's\" to [[John Newcombe]] in 1982 after good wins against [[Tony Roche]], [[Mark Cox (tennis)|Mark Cox]] and [[Ismail El Shafei]]. In 1988 he and Hewitt, older by 20 years between them, beat the Gullikson twins Tim and Tom in the 35's doubles final at Wimbledon.\n\nThe most notable aspect of his game was that he had both a two-handed backhand and forehand, which increased his power while restricting his mobility.  In the 1967 Wimbledon, he and Hewitt did not lose a set, and McMillan did not once lose a service game.\n\nMcMillan was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, in 1992. He now works as a tennis commentator for [[Eurosport]] and on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC Radio 5]] during [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].\n\n== Grand Prix Championship Series singles finals

Steve Arnott ([[Martin Compston]]), an [[authorised firearms officer]], transferred to Anti-Corruption Unit 12 after refusing to agree to cover-up an unlawful shooting by his own team. At AC-12 Arnott is partnered with D.C. Kate Fleming ([[Vicky McClure]]), a highly-commended undercover officer with a keen investigative instinct. She is swiftly promoted to D.S. in series 4 and D.I. in series 5. They work under the supervision of Superintendent Ted Hastings ([[Adrian Dunbar]]), who is one of several Senior Investigating Officers (along with D.C.S. Patricia Carmichael ([[Anna Maxwell Martin]]) of AC-3 and those of AC-9) responsible for uncovering corruption within the police force. Throughout the series, AC-12 investigate seemingly disparate cases involving seemingly-corrupt police officers such as D.C.I. Tony Gates ([[Lennie James]]), D.I. Lindsay Denton ([[Keeley Hawes]]), Sergeant Danny Waldron ([[Daniel Mays]]), D.C.I. Roseanne Huntley ([[Thandie Newton]]) and undercover officer D.S. John Corbett ([[Stephen Graham]]). AC-12 realise the pervasive nature of corruption and the police's deep-rooted links to an organised crime group.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Split section |List of Line of Duty characters|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split, another proposal&nbsp;|date=April 2019}}\n* [[Martin Compston]] as Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, a detective sergeant assigned to AC-12, the anti-corruption unit within Central Police. Previously, he served as a counter-terrorism officer. He transferred after he refused to collude with his colleagues following the fatal shooting of an innocent man.\n* [[Vicky McClure]] as Detective Inspector Kate Fleming, an undercover specialist. A consummate professional, Fleming is willing to investigate officers inside and outside AC-12. Initially a detective constable, she is promoted to detective sergeant at the end of the third series and to detective inspector following the fourth. Fleming is married with a son.\n* [[Adrian Dunbar]] as Superintendent Ted Hastings, the senior investigating officer of AC-12. He recruited Arnott, Fleming and Cottan. Once a member of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], it is revealed that Hastings is a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].\n* [[Craig Parkinson]] as Detective Inspector Matthew \"Dot\" Cottan (series 1, 2 & 3), an AC-12 officer, initially introduced as a Sergeant on Tony Gates' TO-20 team. At the beginning of series 2, he is promoted to detective inspector and transferred to AC-9. He is seconded to AC-12 by Hastings. Cottan is revealed to be \"The Caddy\", working as a fixer for the organised crime group. He is killed at the close of the third series having escaped from AC-12 custody.\n* [[Lennie James]] as Detective Chief Inspector Anthony \"Tony\" Gates (series 1), the head of the serious crime unit TO-20, Tony Gates is renowned for returning the best crime figures of any unit in Central Police.

Suspected of corruption, Gates faces an internal affairs investigation that adds further complications to his troubled home-life.\n* [[Keeley Hawes]] as Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton (series 2 & 3), a silver commander who organises a convoy to transport a protected witness which is ambushed, resulting in the deaths of all the other police officers. As the only police survivor, Denton is arrested, charged with conspiracy to commit murder. She attempts to convince AC-12 of her innocence and regain her reputation, but eventually receives a life sentence. In series 3, Denton is granted an appeal, and is acquitted on the basis of an improper sexual relationship Arnott had with her while she was being investigated. She discovers crucial evidence pertaining to the Danny Waldron murder investigation and historical child sex abuse but after refusing to accept a bribe to conceal that evidence, she is murdered by \"The Caddy\".\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Sergeant Danny Waldron (series 3) is an Authorised Firearms Officer (A.F.O.). His armed response unit is investigated by AC-12, as a matter of routine following the shooting of a suspect. A deeper investigation is initiated when Arnott and Fleming discover the shooting may have been unlawful.

Steve Arnott ([[Martin Compston]]), an [[authorised firearms officer]], transferred to Anti-Corruption Unit 12 after refusing to agree to cover-up an unlawful shooting by his own team. At AC-12 Arnott is partnered with D.C. Kate Fleming ([[Vicky McClure]]), a highly-commended undercover officer with a keen investigative instinct. She is swiftly promoted to D.S. in series 4 and D.I. in series 5. They work under the supervision of Superintendent Ted Hastings ([[Adrian Dunbar]]), who is one of several Senior Investigating Officers (along with D.C.S. Patricia Carmichael ([[Anna Maxwell Martin]]) of AC-3 and those of AC-9) responsible for uncovering corruption within the police force. Throughout the series, AC-12 investigate seemingly disparate cases involving seemingly-corrupt police officers such as D.C.I. Tony Gates ([[Lennie James]]), D.I. Lindsay Denton ([[Keeley Hawes]]), Sergeant Danny Waldron ([[Daniel Mays]]), D.C.I. Roseanne Huntley ([[Thandie Newton]]) and undercover officer D.S. John Corbett ([[Stephen Graham]]). AC-12 realise the pervasive nature of corruption and the police's deep-rooted links to an organised crime group.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Split section |List of Line of Duty characters|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split, another proposal&nbsp;|date=April 2019}}\n* [[Martin Compston]] as Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, a detective sergeant assigned to AC-12, the anti-corruption unit within Central Police. Previously, he served as a counter-terrorism officer. He transferred after he refused to collude with his colleagues following the fatal shooting of an innocent man.\n* [[Vicky McClure]] as Detective Inspector Kate Fleming, an undercover specialist. A consummate professional, Fleming is willing to investigate officers inside and outside AC-12. Initially a detective constable, she is promoted to detective sergeant at the end of the third series and to detective inspector following the fourth. Fleming is married with a son.\n* [[Adrian Dunbar]] as Superintendent Ted Hastings, the senior investigating officer of AC-12. He recruited Arnott, Fleming and Cottan. Once a member of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], it is revealed that Hastings is a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].\n* [[Craig Parkinson]] as Detective Inspector Matthew \"Dot\" Cottan (series 1, 2 & 3), an AC-12 officer, initially introduced as a Sergeant on Tony Gates' TO-20 team. At the beginning of series 2, he is promoted to detective inspector and transferred to AC-9. He is seconded to AC-12 by Hastings. Cottan is revealed to be \"The Caddy\", working as a fixer for the organised crime group. He is killed at the close of the third series having escaped from AC-12 custody.\n* [[Lennie James]] as Detective Chief Inspector Anthony \"Tony\" Gates (series 1), the head of the serious crime unit TO-20, Tony Gates is renowned for returning the best crime figures of any unit in Central Police. It is this reputation, however, that leads AC-12 to his team. Suspected of corruption, Gates faces an internal affairs investigation that adds further complications to his troubled home-life.\n* [[Keeley Hawes]] as Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton (series 2 & 3), a silver commander who organises a convoy to transport a protected witness which is ambushed, resulting in the deaths of all the other police officers. As the only police survivor, Denton is arrested, charged with conspiracy to commit murder. She attempts to convince AC-12 of her innocence and regain her reputation, but eventually receives a life sentence. In series 3, Denton is granted an appeal, and is acquitted on the basis of an improper sexual relationship Arnott had with her while she was being investigated. She discovers crucial evidence pertaining to the Danny Waldron murder investigation and historical child sex abuse but after refusing to accept a bribe to conceal that evidence, she is murdered by \"The Caddy\".\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Sergeant Danny Waldron (series 3) is an Authorised Firearms Officer (A.F.O.). His armed response unit is investigated by AC-12, as a matter of routine following the shooting of a suspect. A deeper investigation is initiated when Arnott and Fleming discover the shooting may have been unlawful. Waldron is shot and killed by a colleague; his death results in an investigation into historic child sex abuse.\n* [[Thandie Newton]] as Detective Chief Inspector Roseanne \"Roz\" Huntley (series 4), the senior investigating officer of Operation Trapdoor, and at the centre of an AC-12 investigation for mishandling evidence.\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as Detective Sergeant John Corbett (series 5), Corbett is an undercover police officer who has been uncontactable for several months. He first appears as John Clayton, the gangleader of an organised crime group which hijacked a police convoy transporting seized drugs.\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Detective Chief Superintendent Patricia Carmichael (series 5), the senior investigating officer of AC-3, who is drafted in to review AC-12's handling of the Corbett investigation.\n\n== Supporting cast ==\n{{Split section |List of Line of Duty characters|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split, another proposal&nbsp;|date=April 2019}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Brian McCardie]] as Tommy Hunter (series 1 & 2)\n* [[Neil Morrissey]] as D.C.

The first two series were  produced by [[World Productions]], on behalf of [[BBC Two]]. David Caffrey and Douglas Mackinnon directed series one. Mackinnon directed the first three episodes of series two and Daniel Nettheim directed the remaining three episodes. Mercurio produced series one and acted as executive producer for series two, with Peter Norris taking over as producer for series two.\n\n===Inspiration===\nAlthough [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom, Crown dependencies and British Overseas Territories|the police]] refused to co-operate with the programme's producers, the production team was advised anonymously by serving officers and by retired police officers. Use was made of anonymous police [[blogs]].<ref name=GuardLoD>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/line-of-duty-police-drama-bbc?newsfeed=true|title=Line of Duty \u2013 a police drama that swaps reassurance for reality|author=Jed Mercurio|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=26 June 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312185421/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/line-of-duty-police-drama-bbc?newsfeed=true|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nSeries one was filmed in [[Birmingham]], including pub interiors in the [[Queen's Arms, Birmingham|Queen's Arms]].<ref name=\"QA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensarmsbar.co.uk/lineofduty.html|title=Line of Duty|accessdate=15 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215211929/http://www.queensarmsbar.co.uk/lineofduty.html|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Series two, three, four and five were made in [[Northern Ireland]] by [[BBC Northern Ireland]].
