Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one [[Computing platform|platform]], increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]] or ''killer app''. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern [[spreadsheet]] software for the Apple II and helped selling the then-new [[personal computer]]s into offices.

It can even be sold, but without transferring the public domain property to other single subjects.

There has been a contentious debate in the computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes, especially on mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s. Web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses, but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon, if ever.

Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* ''Content access software'' is used primarily to access content without editing, but may include software that allows for content editing. Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume [[digital entertainment]] and published digital content. (Examples include [[Media player (application software)|media players]], [[web browser]]s, and help browsers.)\n* ''[[Educational software]]'' is related to content access software, but has the content or features adapted for use in by educators or students.

It is the first installment of the ''[[Race (film series)|Race film series]]'' and stars [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Akshaye Khanna]], [[Katrina Kaif]] and [[Bipasha Basu]] in lead roles. The story is loosely based on the 1998 [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Goodbye Lover]]'' and explores themes of sibling rivalry, betrayal and passion. The supporting cast of ''Race'' includes [[Dalip Tahil]], [[Sameera Reddy]] and [[Johnny Lever]].\n\n''Race'' was filmed in [[Durban]] and [[Dubai]] on a budget of {{INR|46 crore}}. With a runtime of 148 minutes, it premiered worldwide on 21 March 2008, receiving positive to mixed reviews from critics. ''Race'' emerged a major box-office success, grossing a total of {{INR|103.45 crore}} worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=190|title=Race - Movie - Box Office India|publisher=[[Box Office India]]}}</ref> and it was one of the year's highest-grossing Bollywood films.<ref name=\"BOIndia\">{{cite web|work=Box Office India|title=Top Earners 2008 |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=215}}</ref> It was dubbed into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''Panthayam'' and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Race Telugu'', and went on to spawn two sequels\u2014''[[Race 2]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Race 3]]'' in 2018, though the latter was a reboot.\n\n== Plot ==\nA voice-over by RD ([[Anil Kapoor]]) introduces the four main characters: Ranvir Singh \"Ronny\" ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) who runs a successful business he inherited from his father. His younger brother Rajiv Singh ([[Akshaye Khanna]]) who mooches off of Ronny and is an alcoholic. Ronny is dating an upcoming model Sonia ([[Bipasha Basu]]), while his personal assistant Sophia ([[Katrina Kaif]]) appears to be secretly in love with him. Ronny is also involved in an intense competition with a rival horse-owner Kabir ([[Dalip Tahil]]). The film opens with a murder plot involving a car accident which Ronny narrowly survives. When Ronny loses money in a race because his jockey had been bribed by Kabir, Ronny plants a bomb in the jockey's car and kills him, showing Ronny to be a ruthless businessman. Later, Ronny also destroys Kabir when the latter offers him money to buy his business, which is in debt.\n\nIn a drunken stupor, Rajiv confesses to Ronny that he likes Sonia and that he would quit drinking if he could spend his life with a woman like her. Ronny immediately stops dating Sonia so that Rajiv can have her. Rajiv and Sonia begin dating and appear happy until, in a twist, Rajiv reveals he knows of Sonia's shady past and has a plan to use Sonia to his advantage. Rajiv reveals that his father had secured identical life-insurance policies for huge sums on each of the sons. He explains that he wants to kill Ronny in what would appear to be an accident and inherit $100 million in insurance payments and wants Sonia to play along. Sonia agrees to help in exchange for $20 million. They pretend to get married and Rajiv ignores Sonia in this fake-marriage while continuing to play an alcoholic. As per his instructions, Sonia seduces Ronny who confesses he loved her all along. Rajiv reveals the rest of his plan: to threaten to commit suicide in response to Sonia and Ronny's affair by leaping off a tall building, have Ronny appear on the terrace, and get Sonia to push Ronny off. However, it turns out Ronny was aware of the plan all along as Sonia had been keeping him updated, having always been in league with him. They then plan to apparently kill Rajiv, using his own plan against him.\n\nThings go according to plan but Sonia double-crosses Ronny and pushes him off, saying she loved him, but the money was more important. Inspector RD appears at this point to investigate the death, accompanied by his idiotic assistant Mini ([[Sameera Reddy]]). Upon his arrival, he immediately suspects foul play in the death. During his investigation, Ronny's assistant Sophia reveals that she was married to Ronny and produces a legitimate marriage certificate. Sonia is shocked that their plan has been thwarted as Sophia is now the heir to the insurance money. In another twist, Sophia was in on the plan all along and is Rajiv's secret collaborator. Rajiv plans to bump off Sonia after he and Sophia get the insurance money. However, RD figures out during his investigation that Sophia and Rajiv had faked her marriage with Ranvir and that he had been tricked into signing the marriage certificate. RD confronts Rajiv about this and agrees to remain silent about it in exchange for $25 million.\n\nRajiv hires the same hitman who had attempted to murder Ronny at the beginning to kill Sonia, revealing that he had been behind the first murder attempt, too. Sonia is lured into following Rajiv and Sophia to a parking lot where the hitman attacks her.  Just as the hitman is about to kill her, Ronny reappears and rescues her, killing the hitman in the process.\n\nLater, when Rajiv and Sophia plan to celebrate, Ronny appears and confronts them. He explains that he had overheard Rajiv discussing the failed murder attempt with the hitman and had been playing along the whole time so he could get the insurance money from his own fake-death along with the insurance money from killing Rajiv. Discovering that Rajiv's hatred towards him as a half brother was his main reason for doing this, he allows Rajiv one last chance to win by agreeing to a car race. Ranvir shows up to the race in a sports car, whilst Rajiv doesn't. When Rajiv protests, he switches cars with Ranvir. This turns out to be a trick as Rajiv had tampered with the brakes on his own car. Ronny, in turn, lies to Rajiv, claiming he had planted a bomb in his car, similar to the one that killed the jockey, and that it would be detonated if Rajiv ever slowed down below 100&nbsp; mp/h. This causes Rajiv to crash into a petroleum tank, killing him and Sophia, who had been riding with him. Ronny narrowly escapes death himself. Ronny then says that there was no bomb in the car and that Rajiv had \"killed himself\".\n\nIn the end, Ronny collects the insurance money from Rajiv and Sophia's death, along with the money from his own fake-death. Upon fleeing the city, he is stopped by Inspector RD, who had been in on the plan, too, and had helped Ronny fake his death and get the insurance money. Inspector RD takes his $25 million, only to find a bomb in the bag along with the money. The bomb does not detonate, and Ronny reveals that it was a mere precaution to see if RD would try to betray him and take all the money. Ranvir rewards RD for his relative honesty by allowing him to live, and the two drive off in opposite directions while RD hopes to never meet him again.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Anil Kapoor]] as Inspector Robert D'Costa a.k.a.

It is the first installment of the ''[[Race (film series)|Race film series]]'' and stars [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Akshaye Khanna]], [[Katrina Kaif]] and [[Bipasha Basu]] in lead roles. The story is loosely based on the 1998 [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Goodbye Lover]]'' and explores themes of sibling rivalry, betrayal and passion. The supporting cast of ''Race'' includes [[Dalip Tahil]], [[Sameera Reddy]] and [[Johnny Lever]].\n\n''Race'' was filmed in [[Durban]] and [[Dubai]] on a budget of {{INR|46 crore}}. With a runtime of 148 minutes, it premiered worldwide on 21 March 2008, receiving positive to mixed reviews from critics. ''Race'' emerged a major box-office success, grossing a total of {{INR|103.45 crore}} worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=190|title=Race - Movie - Box Office India|publisher=[[Box Office India]]}}</ref> and it was one of the year's highest-grossing Bollywood films.<ref name=\"BOIndia\">{{cite web|work=Box Office India|title=Top Earners 2008 |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=215}}</ref> It was dubbed into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''Panthayam'' and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Race Telugu'', and went on to spawn two sequels\u2014''[[Race 2]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Race 3]]'' in 2018, though the latter was a reboot.\n\n== Plot ==\nA voice-over by RD ([[Anil Kapoor]]) introduces the four main characters: Ranvir Singh \"Ronny\" ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) who runs a successful business he inherited from his father. His younger brother Rajiv Singh ([[Akshaye Khanna]]) who mooches off of Ronny and is an alcoholic. Ronny is dating an upcoming model Sonia ([[Bipasha Basu]]), while his personal assistant Sophia ([[Katrina Kaif]]) appears to be secretly in love with him. Ronny is also involved in an intense competition with a rival horse-owner Kabir ([[Dalip Tahil]]). The film opens with a murder plot involving a car accident which Ronny narrowly survives. When Ronny loses money in a race because his jockey had been bribed by Kabir, Ronny plants a bomb in the jockey's car and kills him, showing Ronny to be a ruthless businessman. Later, Ronny also destroys Kabir when the latter offers him money to buy his business, which is in debt.\n\nIn a drunken stupor, Rajiv confesses to Ronny that he likes Sonia and that he would quit drinking if he could spend his life with a woman like her. Ronny immediately stops dating Sonia so that Rajiv can have her. Rajiv and Sonia begin dating and appear happy until, in a twist, Rajiv reveals he knows of Sonia's shady past and has a plan to use Sonia to his advantage. Rajiv reveals that his father had secured identical life-insurance policies for huge sums on each of the sons. He explains that he wants to kill Ronny in what would appear to be an accident and inherit $100 million in insurance payments and wants Sonia to play along. Sonia agrees to help in exchange for $20 million. They pretend to get married and Rajiv ignores Sonia in this fake-marriage while continuing to play an alcoholic. As per his instructions, Sonia seduces Ronny who confesses he loved her all along. Rajiv reveals the rest of his plan: to threaten to commit suicide in response to Sonia and Ronny's affair by leaping off a tall building, have Ronny appear on the terrace, and get Sonia to push Ronny off. However, it turns out Ronny was aware of the plan all along as Sonia had been keeping him updated, having always been in league with him. They then plan to apparently kill Rajiv, using his own plan against him.\n\nThings go according to plan but Sonia double-crosses Ronny and pushes him off, saying she loved him, but the money was more important. Inspector RD appears at this point to investigate the death, accompanied by his idiotic assistant Mini ([[Sameera Reddy]]). Upon his arrival, he immediately suspects foul play in the death. During his investigation, Ronny's assistant Sophia reveals that she was married to Ronny and produces a legitimate marriage certificate. Sonia is shocked that their plan has been thwarted as Sophia is now the heir to the insurance money. In another twist, Sophia was in on the plan all along and is Rajiv's secret collaborator. Rajiv plans to bump off Sonia after he and Sophia get the insurance money. However, RD figures out during his investigation that Sophia and Rajiv had faked her marriage with Ranvir and that he had been tricked into signing the marriage certificate. RD confronts Rajiv about this and agrees to remain silent about it in exchange for $25 million.\n\nRajiv hires the same hitman who had attempted to murder Ronny at the beginning to kill Sonia, revealing that he had been behind the first murder attempt, too. Sonia is lured into following Rajiv and Sophia to a parking lot where the hitman attacks her.  Just as the hitman is about to kill her, Ronny reappears and rescues her, killing the hitman in the process.\n\nLater, when Rajiv and Sophia plan to celebrate, Ronny appears and confronts them. He explains that he had overheard Rajiv discussing the failed murder attempt with the hitman and had been playing along the whole time so he could get the insurance money from his own fake-death along with the insurance money from killing Rajiv. Discovering that Rajiv's hatred towards him as a half brother was his main reason for doing this, he allows Rajiv one last chance to win by agreeing to a car race. Ranvir shows up to the race in a sports car, whilst Rajiv doesn't. When Rajiv protests, he switches cars with Ranvir. This turns out to be a trick as Rajiv had tampered with the brakes on his own car. Ronny, in turn, lies to Rajiv, claiming he had planted a bomb in his car, similar to the one that killed the jockey, and that it would be detonated if Rajiv ever slowed down below 100&nbsp; mp/h. This causes Rajiv to crash into a petroleum tank, killing him and Sophia, who had been riding with him. Ronny narrowly escapes death himself. Ronny then says that there was no bomb in the car and that Rajiv had \"killed himself\".\n\nIn the end, Ronny collects the insurance money from Rajiv and Sophia's death, along with the money from his own fake-death. Upon fleeing the city, he is stopped by Inspector RD, who had been in on the plan, too, and had helped Ronny fake his death and get the insurance money. Inspector RD takes his $25 million, only to find a bomb in the bag along with the money. The bomb does not detonate, and Ronny reveals that it was a mere precaution to see if RD would try to betray him and take all the money. Ranvir rewards RD for his relative honesty by allowing him to live, and the two drive off in opposite directions while RD hopes to never meet him again.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Anil Kapoor]] as Inspector Robert D'Costa a.k.a.

This time it's Pehli Nazar Mein.\" while Atta Khan wrote \"the soundtrack of Race turns out to be a typical Pritam offering for a bigger profile movie; a few solid tracks that will make the intended impact on screen (especially for the promos) and could well elevate sales for the soundtrack as well. But in all other respects it is unspectacular, unoriginal and uninspiring and apart from 'Pehli Nazar Mein' and a few nice remixes by DJ Suketu, provides little scope for repeated listening\".

{"title_page": "Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Character class (''Dungeons & Dragons'')}}\nA '''character class''' is a fundamental part of the identity and nature of characters in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]]. A character's capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses are largely defined by its class; choosing a class is one of the first steps a player takes to [[character creation|create]] a ''Dungeons & Dragons'' [[player character]].<ref name=\"Fine\">{{Cite book | first=Gary Alan | last=Fine | year=2002 | title=Shared Fantasy: Role Playing Games as Social Worlds | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=16&ndash;18 | isbn=0-226-24944-1 }}</ref> A character's class affects a character's available skills and abilities. A well-rounded party of characters requires a variety of abilities offered by the classes found within the game.\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons'' was the first game to introduce the usage of [[character class]]es to role-playing.<ref name=\"Fine\"/> Many other traditional role-playing games and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s have since adopted the concept as well. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' classes have generally been defined in the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', one of the three core rulebooks; a variety of alternate classes have also been defined in supplemental sourcebooks.\n\n==Classes by type==\n===Principal base classes===\nThese classes have appeared as character classes in the core books of multiple published editions:\n* [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barbarian]]\n* [[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]]\n* [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]]\n* [[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid]]\n* [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]]\n* [[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk]]\n* [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]]\n* [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger]]\n* [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rogue]]\n* [[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sorcerer]]\n* [[Warlock (Dungeons & Dragons)|Warlock]]\n* [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Wizard]]\n\n===Alternative base classes===\n{{See also|List of alternative Dungeons & Dragons classes}}\nWhile the main character classes available have been fairly stable since the 1st edition of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'', a variety of alternate base classes have been offered in supplemental books. The release of ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' in 1985, for instance, introduced the new (at the time) base class of [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barbarian]] and reworked Paladins to be a type of the new base class [[Cavalier (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cavalier]]; ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' also introduced a number of alternate classes more appropriate for an Eastern setting. The 2nd edition added several completely new base classes (e.g. [[Runecaster (Dungeons & Dragons)|Runecaster]], and [[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Shaman]]); in addition, supplemental handbooks offered a variety of \"kits\" to customize each base class, and the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' offered suggestions on how to balance custom classes created by individual players. The 3rd edition introduced five [[Non-player character|NPC]] classes not intended for player use in its ''Dungeon Master's Guide''.\n\nNon-core base classes are considered optional and do not always exist in all settings. For example, the [[Samurai (Dungeons & Dragons)|Samurai]] class introduced in the ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' book may not make sense in a game set in a standard European-style realm. Similarly, classes associated with [[psionics]] such as the [[Psychic Warrior]] don't apply to worlds without psionics.\n\n===Multiclassing===\nMost editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have allowed for the possibility to either advance in more than one class simultaneously, alternately taking levels in more than one class, or branching out in a second (or more) class at a specific point defined by the first class, a concept generally called multiclassing.\n\nIn the 1st and 2nd editions, changing a character's class is difficult. Only those playing as humans can, and it requires extremely high stats to do so. This is called \"dual-classing\". Non-humans, on the other hand, can \"multiclass\" where they effectively learn two (or rarely even three) classes at the same time at the cost of a slower character level progression.\n\n3rd edition allows players to mix and match levels from any number of classes, though certain combinations are more effective than others. In addition, Prestige classes add more options for multiclassing. This edition offers the most freedom regarding multiclassing. There are, however, penalties to the rate of experience point gained if classes are added haphazardly. The [[Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition)|3rd edition version of ''Unearthed Arcana'']] includes rules for gestalt characters which combine the advantages of two classes.\n\nThe 4th edition allows characters to take a [[Feat (Dungeons & Dragons)|feat]] that grants access to specific facets of another class. The class-specific multiclass feats are also prerequisites for the power-swap feats, each of which allows the character to swap out a daily, encounter, or utility power from their first class for one from their second class. Also, at level 11, a character with a multiclass feat and all of the power-swap feats is eligible for paragon multiclassing, which allows them to gain additional powers from their second class in lieu of taking a [[#Paragon paths and epic destinies|Paragon Path]]. Some classes are only available through multiclassing; the first such class was Spellscarred, introduced in the Forgotten Realms Player's Guide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bart Carroll |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4pr/20080703a |title=Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Article (July and Beyond) |publisher=Wizards.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> In the 4th edition, each character can only multiclass into a single class, unless otherwise stated by their primary class (such as the Bard). The ''Player's Handbook III'' introduced \"hybrid\" classes, a deeper form of multiclassing in which elements of two classes are combined each level.\n\nIn the 5th edition, multiclassing requires minimum ability scores before it can be chosen, however the requirements are not as steep as in previous editions. The core classes only require an ability score of 13 or greater in the specific requisite score, except for the Monk, Paladin and Ranger (who need 13s in two stats).<ref name=PHB5>{{cite book| last1=Mearls|first1=Mike|authorlink1=Mike Mearls|last2=Crawford|first2=Jeremey|authorlink2=Jeremy Crawford| title=[[Player's Handbook]] | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==Classes by editions==\n{{main article|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}\nIn the [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' boxed set]], there were only three main classes: the [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]], the [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighting man]], and the [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic-User]]. The first supplement, ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'', added the [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]] as a fourth main class, as well as the [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]] as a Fighting Man subclass. These four fantasy gaming archetypes represent four major tactical roles in play: the Fighter offers direct combat strength and durability; the Thief offers cunning and stealth; the Cleric provides support in both combat and magic; and the Magic-User has a variety of magical powers. In many ways, other classes are thought of as alternatives that refine or combine these functions. Dwarves and Halflings were restricted to the Fighting Man class, and Elves were restricted to the Fighting Man and Magic-User classes; all three non-human races had limited level advancement.\n\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 1st edition===\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|''Player's Handbook'' classes<ref>{{cite book \n | first=Ian | last=Livingstone\n | year=1982 | title=Dicing with Dragons\n | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-7100-9466-3 | page=74 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Base class||Sub-classes\n|-\n|[[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]]||n/a\n|-\n|[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]]||[[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid]]\n|-\n|[[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk]]||n/a\n|-\n|[[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]]||Assassin\n|-\n|[[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]]||[[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]], [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger]]\n|-\n|[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic-User]]||[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Illusionist]]\n|}\n</div>\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' loosened the restrictions on race and class combinations, although non-human races often had restricted choices among classes and maximum levels they could reach in a class. Additional classes that had first appeared in supplements and articles in ''[[The Strategic Review]]'' magazine were included as base classes. The ''Player's Handbook'' also introduced the [[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]] as a sixth base class; however, its usage in 1st edition was more akin to what would be called a [[#Prestige classes|prestige class]] in later editions, as it was not a legal choice for a starting character. Instead, a character had to start as a Fighter, change classes to a Thief, and finally switch classes once more to become a Bard.\n\nA character's ability scores directly tied into what class choices were legal for them. For instance, a character wishing to be a Fighter required at least 9 Strength; the more discriminating Monk required 15 Strength, 15 Wisdom, 15 Dexterity, and 11 Constitution.<ref name=\"lookback\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/alumni/20060602a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061516/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Falumni%2F20060602a| title= A Look Back at Player's Handbooks |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> Unusually high or low ability scores could proscribe class choice further; \"too high\" an Intelligence could prohibit being a Fighter, while a Charisma of 5 or less would require the character to become an Assassin. High ability scores in statistics considered pertinent to the class would grant an experience bonus.\n\nThe ''Player's Handbook'' brought about other changes in the game and its character classes.<ref name=\"WD10\"/> Fighters, clerics and thieves have improved hit-dice (D10, D8 and D6 respectively) over the previous edition. The effects of a character's strength score on hit probability, damage, weight allowed, and open doors rolls were changed. High intelligence conferred an increased chance for both spell knowledge and ability to learn languages. A high wisdom score now gave clerics a spell bonus, while low wisdom gave a chance of spell failure. New charts delineated the effects of constitution, dexterity and charisma. Each of the five main character classes and five sub-classes had its own experience table; for most classes it was now harder to gain promotion above third or fourth levels. multiclassed characters were also introduced.<ref name=\"WD10\">{{cite journal  | last =Turnbull  | first =Don  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Players Handbook| type = review  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 10  | page =17  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=December 1978 \u2013 January 1979  | url =  | issn =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\n''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' added the Cavalier, Barbarian, and Thief-Acrobat classes.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set''===\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set'' classes\n|-\n|Human classes||[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]], [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]], [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic User]], [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]]\n|-\n|Demi-human classes||[[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dwarf]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|Elf]], [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|Halfling]]\n|}\n</div>\nThe second version of the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' combined the idea of race and class; non-human races did not have classes. Hence, a character might be a (human) Cleric or else simply an \"Elf\" or \"Dwarf\". The ''Basic Set'' presented four human classes: Cleric, Fighter, Magic User and Thief, and three demi-human classes: Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling. The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion Set]]'' introduced four optional classes for high-level characters: the Avenger, Paladin, and Knight for Fighters, and the Druid for Clerics.  The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Set|Master Set]]'' introduced one additional class: the Mystic. The ''[[Mystara#Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteers|Gazetteer]]'' series included many optional classes for humans and non-humans, including the shaman (GAZ12) and shamani (GAZ14).

As such, it sought to simplify the rules and straighten out contradictions. Character classes were divided into four groups or \"metaclasses\": Warrior, Wizard, Priest, and Rogue. Each of these groups had a \"base\" class which only required at least a 9 in the \"prime requisite\" statistic in Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Thief; these were intended to be playable in any setting. The ''Player's Handbook'' went on to say that \"all of the other classes are optional.\"<ref name=\"2edPHB\" /> Each group of classes had the same hit dice (determining [[hit point]] growth), THAC0 progression, and [[saving throw]] table.<ref name=\"2edPHB\">{{cite book  | first = David | last = Cook  | year = 1995 | origyear = 1989b | title = [[Player's Handbook]]  | edition = Revised | publisher = TSR  | isbn = 0-7869-0329-5 | url = }}</ref> 2nd edition maintained minimums in certain statistics to qualify for some classes, but removed many of the other restrictions such as one extremely low statistic forcing a character into a specific class.\n\n====Changes====\nMagic-using classes were altered in the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition had two unified spell groups, one for wizard spells and another for priest spells. These lists were then further subdivided by school of magic and sphere of influence, respectively. Different classes had access to different schools or spheres, allowing for each class to have distinct spell lists. \n\nThe illusionist class from 1st edition, for example, became a type of specialist wizard; specialists gained the ability to cast extra spells of their chosen [[Arcane magic (Dungeons & Dragons)|school of magic]] in exchange for the inability to cast spells of \"opposed\" schools; an illusionist would gain extra spells per day in the school of illusion, but would be denied access to the schools of abjuration, necromancy, and evocation. \n\nA similar distinction was made for priests. 2nd edition introduced priests of a specific mythology who would gain their own specific abilities, restrictions, and sphere of influence selection. The druid was provided as an example; the specification of other specialty priests was left to dungeon masters and setting books. As an example, a specialty priest of Tempus, the god of war in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' campaign setting, can incite a berserker rage in allies and lacks the \"only blunt weapons\" restriction of normal clerics. The selection of spheres of influence worked similarly to the allowed and forbidden schools of magic. \n\nThe bard class was changed to be a normal class that could be chosen at character creation. The assassin and monk classes were removed from the 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook''. The ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' clarified the rationale behind the decision in a section on creating new character classes:\n\n{{quote|What is a Viking but a fighter with a certain outlook on life and warfare? A witch is really nothing but a female wizard. A vampire hunter is only a title assumed by a character of any class who is dedicated to the destruction and elimination of those loathsome creatures.\n\nThe same is true of assassins. Killing for profit requires no special powers, only a specific reprehensible outlook. Choosing the title does not imply any special powers or abilities. The character just uses his current skills to fulfill a specific, personal set of goals.|''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', 2nd edition}}\n\nClass-specific supplements for 2nd edition introduced a number of additional class modifications called ''kits'', which allowed players to create characters with particular themes without having to introduce additional classes. The assassin, barbarian, and monk were re-implemented in such fashion, with the barbarian receiving its own ''Complete Barbarian's Handbook'' as part of the series. [[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Shamans]] and [[Runecaster (Dungeons & Dragons)|runecasters]] were likewise included as kits, while [[Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons)|psionic characters]] were introduced in the ''Complete Psionics Handbook''.\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons'' 3rd edition===\nThe 3rd edition abolished the practice of grouping classes directly, allowing hit dice, attack bonus, and saving throws to vary for each particular class again. 3rd edition also saw the return of the Monk as a base class, the creation of the new Sorcerer class, and the inclusion of Barbarian as a base ''Player's Handbook'' class, previously described in 1st edition's ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' rules and as an optional kit in 2nd edition. Statistical requirements on classes and experience bonuses were abolished, though a low score in an important statistic to a class would still adversely affect a character in it.\n\n3rd edition allows for a much more fluid idea of multiclassing than earlier editions, as one unified experience-points-per-level table was made. Rather than earlier editions' rules on splitting experience, characters can simply choose which class they wish to take a new level in and add the appropriate bonus from the class.\n\n[[#Prestige classes|Prestige classes]] were also introduced in the 3rd edition's ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', with new classes only available at higher level and after meeting several prerequisites.\n\nIn addition to the eleven classes presented in the PHB, various [[List of alternative Dungeons & Dragons classes#3rd and 3.5 editions|alternate base classes]] were presented in supplements, and the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' presented five weaker classes designed for NPCs.\n\n====Core character class====\nThe eleven base classes presented in the 3rd edition ''Player's Handbook'' are:\n*[[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barbarian (Bbn)]]\n*[[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard (Brd)]]\n*[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric (Clr)]]\n*[[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid (Drd)]]\n*[[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter (Ftr)]]\n*[[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk (Mnk)]]\n*[[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin (Pal)]]\n*[[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger (Rgr)]]\n*[[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rogue (Rog)]]\n*[[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sorcerer (Sor)]]\n*[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Wizard (Wiz)]]\n\n====Alternative classes====\n{{See also|List of alternative Dungeons & Dragons classes#3rd and 3.5 editions}}\nIn addition to ''class variants'' for the eleven core classes, many of the supplemental books introduce new base classes which can be taken from first level or multiclassed into. Some of these books also present prestige classes which have entry requirements only accessible by taking levels in the base classes described in those books (e.g. the Soulcaster prestige class requires the ''soulmelding'' class ability, only offered by the three classes in ''[[Magic of Incarnum]]'').\n\n====Prestige classes====\n{{See also|List of prestige classes}}\nPrestige classes were introduced in third edition as a further means of individualizing a character.<ref name=tresca2010>{{citation | first1=Michael J. | last1=Tresca | title=The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games | publisher=McFarland | year=2010 | isbn=078645895X | page=64 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&pg=PA64 }}</ref> They expand upon the form of multiclassing and are inaccessible at 1st level, specifically meant to be multiclassed into from the base classes. To attain a specific prestige class, a character must first meet a number of prerequisites, such as certain [[Feat (Dungeons & Dragons)|feats]] or membership in a specific organization. Prestige classes offer a focus on different abilities that may be difficult to attain otherwise; for example, the 3rd edition version of the Assassin prestige class grants minor magical powers, more sneak attack damage, and better usage of poison.\n\n====3.5 revision====\nSome of these classes were readjusted for balance in the 3.5 revision of the game.\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons'' 4th edition ===\n\n====Core character classes====\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=4| Classes in 4th edition\n|-\n!colspan=4| ''Player's Handbook''\n|-\n!

Classes can be defined as the combination of a character role with a power source and are differentiated by what active-use class features and powers they give, all of which follow the same pattern of at-will, once per encounter, once daily and utility powers.\n\nThe 4th edition ''Player's Handbook'' does not include some classes from 3rd edition, such as the Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Monk, and Sorcerer (though these classes returned in the second and third volumes of the ''Player's Handbook'') but does include the Warlock (originally introduced the v3.5 sourcebook ''Complete Arcane'') and Warlord (originally introduced as the Marshal in the 3rd edition ''Miniatures Handbook'') which had not appeared in the ''Player's Handbook'' in previous editions. Twenty-six classes were released in total.\n\n=====Power sources=====\nDifferent classes draw on different power sources for their abilities. The power sources used by the ''Player's Handbook'' classes are arcane, divine, and martial. Arcane classes gain magical energy from the cosmos, divine classes receive their power from the gods, and martial classes draw power from training and willpower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080425a |title=4th Edition Excerpts: Powers |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|accessdate=2017-03-28}}</ref> The ''Player's Handbook 2'' introduces the primal power source, which draws power from the spirits of the natural world and features transformation as a theme. ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 379 included the Assassin class, introducing the shadow power source.

''Player's Option: Heroes of the Elemental Chaos'' introduced builds which use the elemental power source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/356170000 |title=Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Product (Heroes of the Elemental Chaos) |publisher=Wizards.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref>\n\n=====Character roles=====\nCharacters of a given class are said to fill a particular role in the party, especially in combat. ''Leaders'' are focused on [[Status effects|buffing]] and healing allies. ''Controllers'' focus on affecting multiple targets at once, either damaging or debuffing them, or altering the battlefield's terrain. ''Defenders'' focus on blocking attacking enemies or drawing their attacks to themselves and are typically focused on melee combat. ''Strikers'' are focused on mobility, dealing heavy damage to single targets and avoiding attacks. While some Leader and Striker classes and builds are focused towards either melee or ranged combat, the roles as a whole are not.\n\n====Paragon paths and epic destinies====\nThe optional prestige classes from earlier editions have instead been replaced by paragon paths and epic destinies as methods of character customization. Each character may choose a paragon path upon reaching the paragon tier at level 11 and an epic destiny upon reaching the epic tier at level 21.\n\nParagon paths are often (though not always) class-specific, and some have additional prerequisites. Other paragon paths are restricted to members of a certain race or are associated with a nation or faction in a campaign setting. Paragon paths generally expand on a character's existing abilities. For example, fighter paragon paths improve a characters toughness, resilience, or damage with melee weapons.\n\nEpic destinies generally have looser prerequisites than paragon paths; many are available to multiple classes, and some, such as Demigod and Eternal Seeker, have 21st level as their only prerequisite. Each epic destiny includes at least one way in which a character can establish a legacy and at least one way in which a character can retire. Most epic destinies provide fewer benefits than paragon paths, but the benefits that they provide are far more powerful. A common feature of an epic destiny is to allow characters to (usually once per day) return to life or otherwise continue to function after dying.\n\nUnlike prestige classes, a character may only take a single paragon path and a single epic destiny, and path and destiny advancement is in addition to class advancement rather than being in lieu of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080423a |title=4th Edition Excerpts: Paragon Paths<!-- Bot generated title --> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518030309/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2F4ex%2F20080423a |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080512a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513011915/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2F4ex%2F20080512a |title=4th Edition Excerpts: Epic Destinies<!-- Bot generated title --> |url-status=dead |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons'' 5th edition===\nClasses in the 5th edition are mechanically and thematically similar to the versions in the 3rd edition.

The release of ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' in 1985, for instance, introduced the new (at the time) base class of [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barbarian]] and reworked Paladins to be a type of the new base class [[Cavalier (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cavalier]]; ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' also introduced a number of alternate classes more appropriate for an Eastern setting. The 2nd edition added several completely new base classes (e.g. [[Runecaster (Dungeons & Dragons)|Runecaster]], and [[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Shaman]]); in addition, supplemental handbooks offered a variety of \"kits\" to customize each base class, and the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' offered suggestions on how to balance custom classes created by individual players. The 3rd edition introduced five [[Non-player character|NPC]] classes not intended for player use in its ''Dungeon Master's Guide''.\n\nNon-core base classes are considered optional and do not always exist in all settings. For example, the [[Samurai (Dungeons & Dragons)|Samurai]] class introduced in the ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' book may not make sense in a game set in a standard European-style realm. Similarly, classes associated with [[psionics]] such as the [[Psychic Warrior]] don't apply to worlds without psionics.\n\n===Multiclassing===\nMost editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have allowed for the possibility to either advance in more than one class simultaneously, alternately taking levels in more than one class, or branching out in a second (or more) class at a specific point defined by the first class, a concept generally called multiclassing.\n\nIn the 1st and 2nd editions, changing a character's class is difficult. Only those playing as humans can, and it requires extremely high stats to do so. This is called \"dual-classing\". Non-humans, on the other hand, can \"multiclass\" where they effectively learn two (or rarely even three) classes at the same time at the cost of a slower character level progression.\n\n3rd edition allows players to mix and match levels from any number of classes, though certain combinations are more effective than others. In addition, Prestige classes add more options for multiclassing. This edition offers the most freedom regarding multiclassing. There are, however, penalties to the rate of experience point gained if classes are added haphazardly. The [[Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition)|3rd edition version of ''Unearthed Arcana'']] includes rules for gestalt characters which combine the advantages of two classes.\n\nThe 4th edition allows characters to take a [[Feat (Dungeons & Dragons)|feat]] that grants access to specific facets of another class. The class-specific multiclass feats are also prerequisites for the power-swap feats, each of which allows the character to swap out a daily, encounter, or utility power from their first class for one from their second class. Also, at level 11, a character with a multiclass feat and all of the power-swap feats is eligible for paragon multiclassing, which allows them to gain additional powers from their second class in lieu of taking a [[#Paragon paths and epic destinies|Paragon Path]]. Some classes are only available through multiclassing; the first such class was Spellscarred, introduced in the Forgotten Realms Player's Guide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bart Carroll |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4pr/20080703a |title=Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Article (July and Beyond) |publisher=Wizards.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> In the 4th edition, each character can only multiclass into a single class, unless otherwise stated by their primary class (such as the Bard). The ''Player's Handbook III'' introduced \"hybrid\" classes, a deeper form of multiclassing in which elements of two classes are combined each level.\n\nIn the 5th edition, multiclassing requires minimum ability scores before it can be chosen, however the requirements are not as steep as in previous editions. The core classes only require an ability score of 13 or greater in the specific requisite score, except for the Monk, Paladin and Ranger (who need 13s in two stats).<ref name=PHB5>{{cite book| last1=Mearls|first1=Mike|authorlink1=Mike Mearls|last2=Crawford|first2=Jeremey|authorlink2=Jeremy Crawford| title=[[Player's Handbook]] | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==Classes by editions==\n{{main article|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}\nIn the [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' boxed set]], there were only three main classes: the [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]], the [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighting man]], and the [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic-User]]. The first supplement, ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'', added the [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]] as a fourth main class, as well as the [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]] as a Fighting Man subclass. These four fantasy gaming archetypes represent four major tactical roles in play: the Fighter offers direct combat strength and durability; the Thief offers cunning and stealth; the Cleric provides support in both combat and magic; and the Magic-User has a variety of magical powers. In many ways, other classes are thought of as alternatives that refine or combine these functions. Dwarves and Halflings were restricted to the Fighting Man class, and Elves were restricted to the Fighting Man and Magic-User classes; all three non-human races had limited level advancement.\n\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 1st edition===\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|''Player's Handbook'' classes<ref>{{cite book \n | first=Ian | last=Livingstone\n | year=1982 | title=Dicing with Dragons\n | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-7100-9466-3 | page=74 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Base class||Sub-classes\n|-\n|[[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]]||n/a\n|-\n|[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]]||[[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid]]\n|-\n|[[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk]]||n/a\n|-\n|[[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]]||Assassin\n|-\n|[[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]]||[[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]], [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger]]\n|-\n|[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic-User]]||[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Illusionist]]\n|}\n</div>\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' loosened the restrictions on race and class combinations, although non-human races often had restricted choices among classes and maximum levels they could reach in a class. Additional classes that had first appeared in supplements and articles in ''[[The Strategic Review]]'' magazine were included as base classes. The ''Player's Handbook'' also introduced the [[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]] as a sixth base class; however, its usage in 1st edition was more akin to what would be called a [[#Prestige classes|prestige class]] in later editions, as it was not a legal choice for a starting character. Instead, a character had to start as a Fighter, change classes to a Thief, and finally switch classes once more to become a Bard.\n\nA character's ability scores directly tied into what class choices were legal for them. For instance, a character wishing to be a Fighter required at least 9 Strength; the more discriminating Monk required 15 Strength, 15 Wisdom, 15 Dexterity, and 11 Constitution.<ref name=\"lookback\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/alumni/20060602a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061516/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Falumni%2F20060602a| title= A Look Back at Player's Handbooks |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> Unusually high or low ability scores could proscribe class choice further; \"too high\" an Intelligence could prohibit being a Fighter, while a Charisma of 5 or less would require the character to become an Assassin. High ability scores in statistics considered pertinent to the class would grant an experience bonus.\n\nThe ''Player's Handbook'' brought about other changes in the game and its character classes.<ref name=\"WD10\"/> Fighters, clerics and thieves have improved hit-dice (D10, D8 and D6 respectively) over the previous edition. The effects of a character's strength score on hit probability, damage, weight allowed, and open doors rolls were changed. High intelligence conferred an increased chance for both spell knowledge and ability to learn languages. A high wisdom score now gave clerics a spell bonus, while low wisdom gave a chance of spell failure. New charts delineated the effects of constitution, dexterity and charisma. Each of the five main character classes and five sub-classes had its own experience table; for most classes it was now harder to gain promotion above third or fourth levels. multiclassed characters were also introduced.<ref name=\"WD10\">{{cite journal  | last =Turnbull  | first =Don  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Players Handbook| type = review  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 10  | page =17  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=December 1978 \u2013 January 1979  | url =  | issn =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\n''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' added the Cavalier, Barbarian, and Thief-Acrobat classes.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set''===\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set'' classes\n|-\n|Human classes||[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]], [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]], [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic User]], [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]]\n|-\n|Demi-human classes||[[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dwarf]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|Elf]], [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|Halfling]]\n|}\n</div>\nThe second version of the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' combined the idea of race and class; non-human races did not have classes. Hence, a character might be a (human) Cleric or else simply an \"Elf\" or \"Dwarf\". The ''Basic Set'' presented four human classes: Cleric, Fighter, Magic User and Thief, and three demi-human classes: Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling. The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion Set]]'' introduced four optional classes for high-level characters: the Avenger, Paladin, and Knight for Fighters, and the Druid for Clerics.  The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Set|Master Set]]'' introduced one additional class: the Mystic. The ''[[Mystara#Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteers|Gazetteer]]'' series included many optional classes for humans and non-humans, including the shaman (GAZ12) and shamani (GAZ14). Additional human and race classes were also presented in other supplements.\n{{clear}}\n\n===''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 2nd edition===\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Group\n!Class\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Warrior\n|[[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]]\n|-\n|[[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]]\n|-\n|[[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Wizard\n|[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Mage]]\n|-\n|Specialist wizard\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Priest\n|[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]]\n|-\n|[[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid]]\n|-\n|Priest of specific mythos\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Rogue\n|[[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]]\n|-\n|[[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]]\n|}\n</div>\n\nThe 2nd edition of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' attempted to streamline what had become a hodgepodge of rules that only applied in specific cases in 1st edition. As such, it sought to simplify the rules and straighten out contradictions. Character classes were divided into four groups or \"metaclasses\": Warrior, Wizard, Priest, and Rogue. Each of these groups had a \"base\" class which only required at least a 9 in the \"prime requisite\" statistic in Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Thief; these were intended to be playable in any setting. The ''Player's Handbook'' went on to say that \"all of the other classes are optional.\"<ref name=\"2edPHB\" /> Each group of classes had the same hit dice (determining [[hit point]] growth), THAC0 progression, and [[saving throw]] table.<ref name=\"2edPHB\">{{cite book  | first = David | last = Cook  | year = 1995 | origyear = 1989b | title = [[Player's Handbook]]  | edition = Revised | publisher = TSR  | isbn = 0-7869-0329-5 | url = }}</ref> 2nd edition maintained minimums in certain statistics to qualify for some classes, but removed many of the other restrictions such as one extremely low statistic forcing a character into a specific class.\n\n====Changes====\nMagic-using classes were altered in the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition had two unified spell groups, one for wizard spells and another for priest spells. These lists were then further subdivided by school of magic and sphere of influence, respectively. Different classes had access to different schools or spheres, allowing for each class to have distinct spell lists. \n\nThe illusionist class from 1st edition, for example, became a type of specialist wizard; specialists gained the ability to cast extra spells of their chosen [[Arcane magic (Dungeons & Dragons)|school of magic]] in exchange for the inability to cast spells of \"opposed\" schools; an illusionist would gain extra spells per day in the school of illusion, but would be denied access to the schools of abjuration, necromancy, and evocation. \n\nA similar distinction was made for priests. 2nd edition introduced priests of a specific mythology who would gain their own specific abilities, restrictions, and sphere of influence selection. The druid was provided as an example; the specification of other specialty priests was left to dungeon masters and setting books. As an example, a specialty priest of Tempus, the god of war in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' campaign setting, can incite a berserker rage in allies and lacks the \"only blunt weapons\" restriction of normal clerics. The selection of spheres of influence worked similarly to the allowed and forbidden schools of magic. \n\nThe bard class was changed to be a normal class that could be chosen at character creation. The assassin and monk classes were removed from the 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook''. The ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' clarified the rationale behind the decision in a section on creating new character classes:\n\n{{quote|What is a Viking but a fighter with a certain outlook on life and warfare? A witch is really nothing but a female wizard. A vampire hunter is only a title assumed by a character of any class who is dedicated to the destruction and elimination of those loathsome creatures.\n\nThe same is true of assassins. Killing for profit requires no special powers, only a specific reprehensible outlook. Choosing the title does not imply any special powers or abilities. The character just uses his current skills to fulfill a specific, personal set of goals.|''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', 2nd edition}}\n\nClass-specific supplements for 2nd edition introduced a number of additional class modifications called ''kits'', which allowed players to create characters with particular themes without having to introduce additional classes. The assassin, barbarian, and monk were re-implemented in such fashion, with the barbarian receiving its own ''Complete Barbarian's Handbook'' as part of the series. [[Shaman (Dungeons & Dragons)|Shamans]] and [[Runecaster (Dungeons & Dragons)|runecasters]] were likewise included as kits, while [[Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons)|psionic characters]] were introduced in the ''Complete Psionics Handbook''.\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons'' 3rd edition===\nThe 3rd edition abolished the practice of grouping classes directly, allowing hit dice, attack bonus, and saving throws to vary for each particular class again. 3rd edition also saw the return of the Monk as a base class, the creation of the new Sorcerer class, and the inclusion of Barbarian as a base ''Player's Handbook'' class, previously described in 1st edition's ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' rules and as an optional kit in 2nd edition. Statistical requirements on classes and experience bonuses were abolished, though a low score in an important statistic to a class would still adversely affect a character in it.\n\n3rd edition allows for a much more fluid idea of multiclassing than earlier editions, as one unified experience-points-per-level table was made. Rather than earlier editions' rules on splitting experience, characters can simply choose which class they wish to take a new level in and add the appropriate bonus from the class.\n\n[[#Prestige classes|Prestige classes]] were also introduced in the 3rd edition's ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', with new classes only available at higher level and after meeting several prerequisites.\n\nIn addition to the eleven classes presented in the PHB, various [[List of alternative Dungeons & Dragons classes#3rd and 3.5 editions|alternate base classes]] were presented in supplements, and the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' presented five weaker classes designed for NPCs.\n\n====Core character class====\nThe eleven base classes presented in the 3rd edition ''Player's Handbook'' are:\n*[[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barbarian (Bbn)]]\n*[[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard (Brd)]]\n*[[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric (Clr)]]\n*[[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid (Drd)]]\n*[[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter (Ftr)]]\n*[[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk (Mnk)]]\n*[[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin (Pal)]]\n*[[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger (Rgr)]]\n*[[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rogue (Rog)]]\n*[[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sorcerer (Sor)]]\n*[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Wizard (Wiz)]]\n\n====Alternative classes====\n{{See also|List of alternative Dungeons & Dragons classes#3rd and 3.5 editions}}\nIn addition to ''class variants'' for the eleven core classes, many of the supplemental books introduce new base classes which can be taken from first level or multiclassed into. Some of these books also present prestige classes which have entry requirements only accessible by taking levels in the base classes described in those books (e.g. the Soulcaster prestige class requires the ''soulmelding'' class ability, only offered by the three classes in ''[[Magic of Incarnum]]'').\n\n====Prestige classes====\n{{See also|List of prestige classes}}\nPrestige classes were introduced in third edition as a further means of individualizing a character.<ref name=tresca2010>{{citation | first1=Michael J. | last1=Tresca | title=The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games | publisher=McFarland | year=2010 | isbn=078645895X | page=64 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&pg=PA64 }}</ref> They expand upon the form of multiclassing and are inaccessible at 1st level, specifically meant to be multiclassed into from the base classes. To attain a specific prestige class, a character must first meet a number of prerequisites, such as certain [[Feat (Dungeons & Dragons)|feats]] or membership in a specific organization. Prestige classes offer a focus on different abilities that may be difficult to attain otherwise; for example, the 3rd edition version of the Assassin prestige class grants minor magical powers, more sneak attack damage, and better usage of poison.\n\n====3.5 revision====\nSome of these classes were readjusted for balance in the 3.5 revision of the game.\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons'' 4th edition ===\n\n====Core character classes====\n<div style=\"float:right;border-left:1em solid white\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=4| Classes in 4th edition\n|-\n!colspan=4| ''Player's Handbook''\n|-\n!

Classes can be defined as the combination of a character role with a power source and are differentiated by what active-use class features and powers they give, all of which follow the same pattern of at-will, once per encounter, once daily and utility powers.\n\nThe 4th edition ''Player's Handbook'' does not include some classes from 3rd edition, such as the Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Monk, and Sorcerer (though these classes returned in the second and third volumes of the ''Player's Handbook'') but does include the Warlock (originally introduced the v3.5 sourcebook ''Complete Arcane'') and Warlord (originally introduced as the Marshal in the 3rd edition ''Miniatures Handbook'') which had not appeared in the ''Player's Handbook'' in previous editions. Twenty-six classes were released in total.\n\n=====Power sources=====\nDifferent classes draw on different power sources for their abilities. The power sources used by the ''Player's Handbook'' classes are arcane, divine, and martial. Arcane classes gain magical energy from the cosmos, divine classes receive their power from the gods, and martial classes draw power from training and willpower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080425a |title=4th Edition Excerpts: Powers |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|accessdate=2017-03-28}}</ref> The ''Player's Handbook 2'' introduces the primal power source, which draws power from the spirits of the natural world and features transformation as a theme.

''Leaders'' are focused on [[Status effects|buffing]] and healing allies. ''Controllers'' focus on affecting multiple targets at once, either damaging or debuffing them, or altering the battlefield's terrain. ''Defenders'' focus on blocking attacking enemies or drawing their attacks to themselves and are typically focused on melee combat. ''Strikers'' are focused on mobility, dealing heavy damage to single targets and avoiding attacks. While some Leader and Striker classes and builds are focused towards either melee or ranged combat, the roles as a whole are not.\n\n====Paragon paths and epic destinies====\nThe optional prestige classes from earlier editions have instead been replaced by paragon paths and epic destinies as methods of character customization. Each character may choose a paragon path upon reaching the paragon tier at level 11 and an epic destiny upon reaching the epic tier at level 21.\n\nParagon paths are often (though not always) class-specific, and some have additional prerequisites. Other paragon paths are restricted to members of a certain race or are associated with a nation or faction in a campaign setting. Paragon paths generally expand on a character's existing abilities. For example, fighter paragon paths improve a characters toughness, resilience, or damage with melee weapons.\n\nEpic destinies generally have looser prerequisites than paragon paths; many are available to multiple classes, and some, such as Demigod and Eternal Seeker, have 21st level as their only prerequisite. Each epic destiny includes at least one way in which a character can establish a legacy and at least one way in which a character can retire. Most epic destinies provide fewer benefits than paragon paths, but the benefits that they provide are far more powerful. A common feature of an epic destiny is to allow characters to (usually once per day) return to life or otherwise continue to function after dying.\n\nUnlike prestige classes, a character may only take a single paragon path and a single epic destiny, and path and destiny advancement is in addition to class advancement rather than being in lieu of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080423a |title=4th Edition Excerpts: Paragon Paths<!-- Bot generated title --> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518030309/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2F4ex%2F20080423a |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080512a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513011915/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2F4ex%2F20080512a |title=4th Edition Excerpts: Epic Destinies<!-- Bot generated title --> |url-status=dead |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===''Dungeons & Dragons'' 5th edition===\nClasses in the 5th edition are mechanically and thematically similar to the versions in the 3rd edition.
