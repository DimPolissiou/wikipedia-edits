He also served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] from [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]] to [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. A former member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], he was on the party's left wing, ideologically identifying as a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]].\n\nBorn in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]], to a working-class family, Livingstone joined Labour in 1968 and was elected to represent [[West Norwood|Norwood]] at the GLC in [[1973 Greater London Council election|1973]], [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] in [[1977 Greater London Council election|1977]], and [[Paddington]] in [[1981 Greater London Council election|1981]]. That year, Labour representatives on the GLC elected him as the council's leader. Attempting to [[Fares Fair|reduce London Underground fares]], his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and underprivileged minorities, despite stiff opposition. The mainstream media gave him the moniker \"Red Ken\" in reference to his socialist beliefs and heavily criticised him for supporting controversial issues like [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]], [[LGBT rights]], and a [[United Ireland]]. Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], which in 1986 abolished the GLC. Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987, he became closely associated with [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaigns. He unsuccessfully stood for [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] on a leftist platform in 1992 and 1994, in the latter losing to [[Tony Blair]]. Livingstone became a vocal critic of Blair's [[New Labour]] project that pushed the party closer to [[centrism|the centre]] and won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].\n\nAfter failing to become Labour's candidate in the [[2000 London mayoral election]], Livingstone successfully contested the election as an [[independent politician|independent candidate]]. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]], [[Oyster card]], and [[articulated bus]]es, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of [[London Underground]]. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the [[Iraq War]], Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was [[2004 London mayoral election|re-elected in 2004]], expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's [[East End of London|East End]], his leadership after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] and [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]], losing both to the Conservative candidate [[Boris Johnson]]. A longstanding critic of [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|Israeli policy regarding the Palestinians]], his comments about the relationship between [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Zionism]] resulted in his suspension from the Labour Party in 2016; he then resigned in 2018.\n\nCharacterised by [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] as \"the only truly successful left-wing British politician of modern times\",{{sfnm|1a1=Moore|1y=2007|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=314|3a1=Eaton|3y=2014}} Livingstone was praised for his efforts to improve rights for women, LGBT people, and ethnic minorities in London, but also faced allegations of [[cronyism]] and [[antisemitism]] and was criticised for his connections to [[Islamism|Islamists]], [[Marxism|Marxists]], and [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and young adulthood: 1945\u20131967===\nLivingstone was born in his grandmother's house in [[Lambeth]], [[south London]], on 17 June 1945.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=26, 28|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2p=1}} His family was working class; his mother, Ethel Ada (n\u00e9e Kennard, 1915\u20131997), had been born in [[Southwark]] before training as an [[acrobatic dance]]r and working on the [[music hall]] circuit prior to the [[Second World War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=27|2a1=Carvel|2y=1999|2p=17|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=1\u20132}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk|title=Births England and Wales 1837\u20131915 |publisher=Freebmd.org.uk |date=21 June 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> Ken's Scottish father, Robert \"Bob\" Moffat Livingstone (1915\u20131971), had been born in [[Dunoon]] before joining the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] in 1932 and becoming a ship's master.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=27\u201328|2a1=Carvel|2y=1999|2pp=18, 36|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Edwards|4a2=Isaby|4y=2008|4pp=32\u201333}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Family Detective:Ken Livingstone|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2007/04/07/nosplit/ftdet107.xml|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London, UK|first=Nick|last=Barratt|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nHaving first met in April 1940 at a music hall in [[Workington]], they married within three months.

Leaving his job at Chester Beatty, in September 1970 he began a 3-year course at the Philippa Fawcett Teacher Training College (PFTTC) in [[Streatham]]; his attendance was poor, and he considered it \"a complete waste\" of time. Beginning a romantic relationship with Christine Chapman, president of the PFTTC student's union, the couple married in 1973.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=44\u201345|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=16\u201318}}\n\nRealising the Conservative governance of Lambeth Borough council was hard to unseat, Livingstone aided Eddie Lopez in reaching out to members of the local populace disenfranchised from the traditional Labour leadership. Associating with the leftist Schools' Action Union (SAU) founded in the wake of the 1968 student protests, he encouraged members of the [[Brixton]] branch of the [[British Black Panthers|Black Panthers]] to join Labour.{{sfn|Livingstone|1987|pp=16\u201317}} His involvement in the SAU led to his dismissal from the PFTCC student's union, who disagreed with politicising secondary school pupils.{{Sfn|Hosken|2008|p=18}}\n\n===Lambeth Housing Committee: 1971\u20131973===\n{{Quote box|width=25em||align=right|quote=\"It was intoxicating to be at what seemed at the time the centre of events.

Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats in the south of the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=41|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=18\u201319|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3p=20}} In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a [[heart attack]]; his mother soon moved to [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=44}} That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee on the [[Lambeth London Borough Council]], his first job in local government.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=42|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2p=21|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3p=21}} Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for [[council housing]], temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest tower blocks, and founded a Family Squatting Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through [[squatting]] in empty houses.

Livingstone backed the strikers, urging Camden Council to grant their demands, eventually getting his way. District auditor Ian Pickwell, a government-appointed accountant who monitored council finances, claimed that this move was reckless and illegal, taking Camden Council to court. If found guilty, Livingstone would have been held personally responsible for the measure, forced to pay the massive [[surcharge (sanction)|surcharge]], and been disqualified for public office for five years; ultimately the judge threw out the case.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=66\u201367|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=99\u2013100|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn May 1979, a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election was held in the United Kingdom]].

A staunch right winger and [[free market]] advocate, she became a bitter opponent of the labour movement and Livingstone.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=67|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2p=64}} Following the electoral defeat, Livingstone told ''Socialist Organiser'' that the blame lay solely with the \"Labour government's policies\" and the anti-democratic attitude of Callaghan and the Parliamentary Labour Party, calling for greater party democracy and a turn towards a socialist platform. This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the SCLV. The primary figurehead for this leftist trend was [[Tony Benn]], who narrowly missed being elected deputy leader of Labour in September 1981, under new party leader [[Michael Foot]]. The head of the \"Bennite left\", Benn became \"an inspiration and a prophet\" to Livingstone; the two became the best known left-wingers in Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=67\u201368|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=90\u201391|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201369|4a1=Turner|4y=2010|4p=32}}\n\n==Greater London Council leadership==\n{{Main|Greater London Council leadership of Ken Livingstone}}\n\n===Becoming leader of the GLC: 1979\u20131981===\nInspired by the Bennites, Livingstone planned a GLC take-over; on 18 October 1979, he called a meeting of Labour leftists entitled \"Taking over the GLC\", beginning publication of monthly newsletter the ''London Labour Briefing''.

At the time, the Brent East Labour Party was characterised by competing factions, with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left. Securing a significant level of support from local party members, he nonetheless failed to apply for the candidacy in time, and so the incumbent centrist [[Reg Freeson]] was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East.

Based on a fare freeze implemented by the [[South Yorkshire|South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council]] in 1975, it was widely considered to be a moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London [[Rates (tax)|rates]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\nThe legality of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the [[London Borough of Bromley]] council, who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it did not operate in their borough. Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC, Bromley Borough took the issue to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], where three judges \u2013 [[Lord Denning]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Justice Oliver]] and Lord Justice Watkins \u2013 reversed the previous decision, finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November.

He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide different parts of the Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] (RMT) and the [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen]] (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the [[picket line]] by Livingstone.{{sfnm|1a1=Hosken|1y=2008|1pp=328\u2013332|2a1=Edwards|2a2=Isaby|2y=2008|2pp=22\u201323}} Appointing [[Bob Kiley]] as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done in the case of the [[New York City Subway]].

He also served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] from [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]] to [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. A former member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], he was on the party's left wing, ideologically identifying as a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]].\n\nBorn in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]], to a working-class family, Livingstone joined Labour in 1968 and was elected to represent [[West Norwood|Norwood]] at the GLC in [[1973 Greater London Council election|1973]], [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] in [[1977 Greater London Council election|1977]], and [[Paddington]] in [[1981 Greater London Council election|1981]]. That year, Labour representatives on the GLC elected him as the council's leader. Attempting to [[Fares Fair|reduce London Underground fares]], his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and underprivileged minorities, despite stiff opposition. The mainstream media gave him the moniker \"Red Ken\" in reference to his socialist beliefs and heavily criticised him for supporting controversial issues like [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]], [[LGBT rights]], and a [[United Ireland]]. Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], which in 1986 abolished the GLC. Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987, he became closely associated with [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaigns. He unsuccessfully stood for [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] on a leftist platform in 1992 and 1994, in the latter losing to [[Tony Blair]]. Livingstone became a vocal critic of Blair's [[New Labour]] project that pushed the party closer to [[centrism|the centre]] and won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].\n\nAfter failing to become Labour's candidate in the [[2000 London mayoral election]], Livingstone successfully contested the election as an [[independent politician|independent candidate]]. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]], [[Oyster card]], and [[articulated bus]]es, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of [[London Underground]]. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the [[Iraq War]], Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was [[2004 London mayoral election|re-elected in 2004]], expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's [[East End of London|East End]], his leadership after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] and [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]], losing both to the Conservative candidate [[Boris Johnson]].

Livingstone backed the strikers, urging Camden Council to grant their demands, eventually getting his way. District auditor Ian Pickwell, a government-appointed accountant who monitored council finances, claimed that this move was reckless and illegal, taking Camden Council to court. If found guilty, Livingstone would have been held personally responsible for the measure, forced to pay the massive [[surcharge (sanction)|surcharge]], and been disqualified for public office for five years; ultimately the judge threw out the case.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=66\u201367|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=99\u2013100|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn May 1979, a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election was held in the United Kingdom]]. Standing as Labour candidate for Hampstead, Livingstone was defeated by the incumbent Conservative, [[Geoffrey Finsberg]]. Weakened by the Winter of Discontent, Callaghan's government lost to the Conservatives, whose leader, [[Margaret Thatcher]], became Prime Minister.

This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the SCLV. The primary figurehead for this leftist trend was [[Tony Benn]], who narrowly missed being elected deputy leader of Labour in September 1981, under new party leader [[Michael Foot]]. The head of the \"Bennite left\", Benn became \"an inspiration and a prophet\" to Livingstone; the two became the best known left-wingers in Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=67\u201368|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=90\u201391|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201369|4a1=Turner|4y=2010|4p=32}}\n\n==Greater London Council leadership==\n{{Main|Greater London Council leadership of Ken Livingstone}}\n\n===Becoming leader of the GLC: 1979\u20131981===\nInspired by the Bennites, Livingstone planned a GLC take-over; on 18 October 1979, he called a meeting of Labour leftists entitled \"Taking over the GLC\", beginning publication of monthly newsletter the ''London Labour Briefing''.

Others stayed in their former positions, including Dave Wetzel as transport chair and Mike Ward as chair of industry; thus was created what biographer John Carvel described as \"the second Livingstone administration\", leading to a \"more calm and supportive environment\".{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=149, 195}} Turning his attention once more to Parliament, Livingstone sought to be selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]], a place which he felt an \"affinity\" for and where several of his friends lived. At the time, the Brent East Labour Party was characterised by competing factions, with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left. Securing a significant level of support from local party members, he nonetheless failed to apply for the candidacy in time, and so the incumbent centrist [[Reg Freeson]] was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East. A subsequent vote at the council meeting revealed that 52 local Labour members would have voted for Livingstone, with only 2 for Freeson and 3 abstentions. Nevertheless, in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election]], Freeson went on to win the Brent East constituency for Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=166\u2013175|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=174\u2013181}} In 1983, Livingstone began co-presenting a late night television chat show with [[Janet Street-Porter]] for [[London Weekend Television]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=199}}\n\n====Fares Fair and transport policy====\n\nThe Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, although written under McIntosh's leadership, had been determined by a special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=83\u201384|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2p=101}} One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as [[Fares Fair]], which focused on reducing [[London Underground]] fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the [[South Yorkshire|South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council]] in 1975, it was widely considered to be a moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London [[Rates (tax)|rates]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\nThe legality of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the [[London Borough of Bromley]] council, who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it did not operate in their borough. Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC, Bromley Borough took the issue to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], where three judges \u2013 [[Lord Denning]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Justice Oliver]] and Lord Justice Watkins \u2013 reversed the previous decision, finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November. They proclaimed that the Fares Fair policy was illegal because the GLC was expressly forbidden from choosing to run London Transport at a deficit, even if this was in the perceived interest of Londoners.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=128\u2013133|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=117\u2013118}} The GLC appealed this decision, taking the case to the [[House of Lords]]; on 17 December five Law Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Bromley Borough Council, putting a permanent end to the Fares Fair policy.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=135\u2013136}} GLC transport chairman Dave Wetzel labelled the judges \"Vandals in Ermine\" while Livingstone maintained his belief that the judicial decision was politically motivated.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nInitially presenting a motion to the GLC Labour groups that they refuse to comply with the judicial decision and continue with the policy regardless, but was out-voted by 32\u201322; many commentators claimed that Livingstone had only been bluffing in order to save face among the Labour Left.{{Sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=140\u2013143}} Instead, Livingstone got on board with a campaign known as \"Keep Fares Fair\" in order to bring about a change in the law that would make the Fares Fair policy legal; an alternate movement, \"Can't Pay, Won't Pay\", accused Livingstone of being a sell-out and insisted that the GLC proceed with its policies regardless of their legality.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=148\u2013150}} One aspect of the London Transport reforms was however maintained; the new system of [[London Underground ticketing|flat fares within ticket zones]], and the inter-modal [[Travelcard]] ticket continues as the basis of the ticketing system.{{sfn|Turner|2010|p=80}} The GLC then put together new measures in the hope of reducing London Transport fares by the more modest amount of 25%, taking them back to roughly the price that they were when Livingstone's administration took office; it was ruled legal in January 1983, and subsequently implemented.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n====GLEB and nuclear disarmament====\nLivingstone's administration founded the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment by investing in the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=126|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=148\u2013149}} Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale-off of GLC council housing largely failed, in part due to the strong opposition from the Conservative government.{{Sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=124\u2013126}} ILEA attempted to carry through with its promise to cut the price of [[school meals]] in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=124}}\n\nThe Livingstone administration took a strong stance on the issue of [[nuclear disarmament]], proclaiming London a \"[[nuclear-free zone]]\". On 20 May 1981, the GLC halted its annual spending of \u00a31 million on nuclear war defence plans, with Livingstone's deputy, Illtyd Harrington, proclaiming that \"we are challenging... the absurd cosmetic approach to Armageddon.\" They published the names of the 3000 politicians and administrators who had been earmarked for survival in underground bunkers in the event of a nuclear strike on London. Thatcher's government remained highly critical of these moves, putting out a propaganda campaign explaining their argument for the necessity of Britain's [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrent]] to counter the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Hosken|2008|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\n====Egalitarian policies====\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"Arguing that politics had long been the near-exclusive preserve of white middle-aged men, the GLC began an attempt to open itself to representations from other groups, principally from women, the working-class, ethnic minorities and homosexuals but also from children and the elderly.

One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\n\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.<ref name=\"Mooney 1900 393\"/> They may have moved south into [[Muscogee Creek]] territory and settled at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the [[Mississippian culture]] and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]]. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\n\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands? Early settlers?|last=Boyle|first=John|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=August 21, 2017|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPre-contact Cherokee are considered to be part of the later [[Pisgah Phase]] of Southern Appalachia, which lasted from circa 1000 to 1500.<ref>Sturtevant and Fogelson, 132</ref> Despite the consensus among most specialists in Southeast archeology and anthropology, some scholars{{Who|date=November 2014}} contend that ancestors of the Cherokee people lived in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee for a far longer period of time.<ref>Finger, 6\u20137</ref> During the late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] and [[Woodland Period]], Native Americans in the region began to cultivate plants such as [[Iva annua|marsh elder]], [[Chenopodium berlandieri|lambsquarters]], [[Amaranthus palmeri|pigweed]], [[Helianthus annuus|sunflowers]], and some native [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].\n\n==Early cultures==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the [[Mississippian culture]], the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the [[Muscogee]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a '''Chalaque''' nation as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet.<ref>Mooney</ref> As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\n\nThe American writer [[John Howard Payne]] wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\n\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.<ref name = \"Irwina-1992\">Irwin 1992.</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.<ref>Mooney, p. 392.</ref> By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/>\n\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/> Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\n\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], an indication of their migration from another area. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern <!-- Have not read theory of Iroquois migration to the north - not typical of patterns across the continent --> migration.\n\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of [[Haudenosaunee|their political confederacy]], known as the ''Haudenosaunee''.<ref>[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_041100_tuscarora.htm David Landy, \"Tuscarora\"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', Cengage Learning Website, Houghton Mifflin Company, accessed January 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago.

In 1735 the Cherokee were estimated to have sixty-four towns and villages, and 6,000 fighting men.  In 1738 and 1739 [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity to the new infectious disease.  Nearly half their population died within a year.  Hundreds of other Cherokee committed [[suicide]] due to their losses and disfigurement from the disease.\n[[File:Three Cherokee.jpg|thumb|250px|right|After the [[Anglo-Cherokee War]], bitterness remained between the two groups.

To remedy this, they generally slit but one at a time; so soon as the patient can bear it, they wound round with wire to expand them, and are adorned with silver pendants and rings, which they likewise wear at the nose.

The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]].<ref name=\"Rozema, pp. 17\u201323\">Rozema, pp. 17\u201323.</ref>\n\nKing George III's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.

The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773\u20131774).\n\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\n\n[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee\u2013American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].\n\n====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref>Mooney, James. ''History, Myths, and Scared Formulas of the Cherokee'', p. 83. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900).</ref>\n\nNotable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of [[James Vann]]), Daniel Ross (father of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts Jr.]]), [[Chisholm Tavern (Knoxville)|John D.

Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\n\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Acculturation====\nThe Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]\n\n[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\n\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788\u20131801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801\u20131811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].\n\nIn 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.

Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\n\nAround 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\n[[File:New Echota.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee National Council building, [[New Echota]]]]\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]).

They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the [[Vermont]] missionary [[Samuel Worcester]] and Major Ridge's nephew [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], who had taken the name of his [[Elias Boudinot|white benefactor]], a leader of the [[Continental Congress]] and [[New Jersey]] Congressman.

This effort was headed by Indian Agent [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return J.

Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to a new Indian Territory.\n\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Lenape|Delaware]]\" had suffered.<ref>Wishart, p. 120</ref>  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques.

His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim.

On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother [[Stand Watie]] fought and survived that day, escaping to [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn 1827, [[Sequoyah]] had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n=====Eastern Band=====\n[[File:C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright|C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\n\nThe Cherokee living along the [[Oconaluftee River]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements. They rejected the reforms of the Cherokee Nation.  When the Cherokee government ceded all territory east of the [[Little Tennessee River]] to [[North Carolina]] in 1819, they withdrew from the Nation.<ref>Theda Purdue, ''Native Carolinians: The Indians of North Carolina'', pg. 40</ref> [[William Holland Thomas]], a white store owner and state legislator from [[Jackson County, North Carolina]], helped over 600 Cherokee from [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Qualla Town]] obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal.

An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states.  They were mostly mixed-race and Cherokee women married to white men. Together, these groups were the ancestors of the federally recognized [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], and some of the state-recognized tribes in surrounding states.\n\n====Civil War====\n[[File:Cherokee Confederates Reunion.gif|right|325px|thumb|Cherokee confederates reunion in [[New Orleans]], 1902.]]\n\n{{Further|Cherokee in the American Civil War|Native Americans in the Civil War}}\nThe [[American Civil War]] was devastating for both East and Western Cherokee.

(March 10, 2007)</ref> Cherokee in Indian Territory divided into Union and Confederate factions, with most supporting the Confederacy.\n\n[[Stand Watie]], the leader of the Ridge Party, raised a regiment for [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] service in 1861. [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who had reluctantly agreed to ally with the Confederacy, was captured by Federal troops in 1862. He lived in self-imposed exile in [[Philadelphia]], supporting the Union. In Indian Territory, the national council of those who supported the Union voted to abolish slavery in the Cherokee Nation in 1863, but they were not the majority slaveholders and the vote had little effect on those supporting the Confederacy.\n\nWatie was elected Principal Chief of the pro-Confederacy majority. A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862. He became a Brigadier General of the [[Confederate States]]; the only other American Indian to hold the rank in the American Civil War was [[Ely S. Parker]] with the Union Army.  On June 25, 1865, two months after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to stand down.\n\n====Reconstruction and late 19th century====\n[[File:Group of Cherokee, Yankton, and Sisseton 1909.jpg|thumb|left|William Penn (Cherokee), His Shield (Yanktonai), Levi Big Eagle (Yanktonai), Bear Ghost (Yanktonai) and Black Moustache (Sisseton).]]\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government required the Cherokee Nation to sign a new treaty, because of its alliance with the Confederacy. The U.S. required the 1866 Treaty to provide for the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of all Cherokee slaves, and full citizenship to all Cherokee [[freedmen]] and all African Americans who chose to continue to reside within tribal lands, so that they \"shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.\"<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm \"Treaty with the Cherokee, 1866.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630013134/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm |date=June 30, 2010 }} ''Oklahoma Historical Society: Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties.

Many Cherokee Freedmen have been active politically within the tribe.\n\nThe US government also acquired [[easement]] rights to the western part of the territory, which became the [[Oklahoma Territory]], for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\n\nThe [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThe [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative.

Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.<ref>Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57\u20138</ref>\n\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.<ref name=\"Perdue 1999, p. 176\"/> As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the US government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Cherokee ethnobotany]]\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times different, roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the [[clan]]s.

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\n\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af}}), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9}}) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\n\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be}})  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\n\nOther examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a7\u13eb}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13e9\u13e5}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5}}) or \"big watch\" for ''clock'').\n\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9: \u13c2\u13a6\u13d3 \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb \u13c2\u13a8\u13ab\u13d3\u13b8\u13be \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c2\u13e0\u13f1 \u13a4\u13be\u13d5\u13bf \u13da\u13f3\u13a7\u13db \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2. \u13a8\u13e5\u13c1\u13b3 \u13a4\u13be\u13d3\u13c5\u13d6\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c3\u13df\u13cd\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13cc\u13ca \u13a8\u13d2 \u13e7\u13c2\u13b8\u13eb\u13cd\u13d3\u13c1\u13d7 \u13a0\u13be\u13df\u13c5\u13e2 \u13a0\u13d3\u13c5\u13d9 \u13ac\u13d7.<ref name=\"Omniglot\">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm |title=Cherokee syllabary |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |date=1998\u20132009 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" | [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]]: {{lang|chr|Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.

On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established.

The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-sixteenth Cherokee blood quantum (genealogical descent, equivalent to one great-great-grandparent) and an ancestor on the Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent), and the UKB does not allow members that have relinquished their membership to re-enroll in the UKB.<ref>[http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html Enrollment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609034110/http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html |date=June 9, 2010 }} ''United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.''

Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.\n\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\n\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.<ref>* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]\n* [http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/default.aspx (Pre-convention \u2013 1999) Oral and Written Testimonies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104091145/http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/Default.aspx |date=January 4, 2011 }}\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/census.htm Cherokee Census Rolls, a follow-up]\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/chapman.htm Chapman Roll Eastern Cherokees, 1851]\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 Treaty with the Cherokee, 1817] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 |date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Cherokee Freedmen===\n{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] -->\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866.

One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\n\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.<ref name=\"Mooney 1900 393\"/> They may have moved south into [[Muscogee Creek]] territory and settled at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the [[Mississippian culture]] and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]]. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\n\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands?

People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].\n\n==Early cultures==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the [[Mississippian culture]], the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the [[Muscogee]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a '''Chalaque''' nation as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet.<ref>Mooney</ref> As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\n\nThe American writer [[John Howard Payne]] wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\n\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.<ref name = \"Irwina-1992\">Irwin 1992.</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.<ref>Mooney, p. 392.</ref> By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/>\n\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/> Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\n\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], an indication of their migration from another area. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern <!-- Have not read theory of Iroquois migration to the north - not typical of patterns across the continent --> migration.\n\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of [[Haudenosaunee|their political confederacy]], known as the ''Haudenosaunee''.<ref>[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_041100_tuscarora.htm David Landy, \"Tuscarora\"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', Cengage Learning Website, Houghton Mifflin Company, accessed January 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago.

This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.\n\nThey that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and [[moccasins|mockasons]] ([[sic]]), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...<ref name=Timberlake>{{cite web|last=Timberlake|first=Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry Timberlake|publisher=London 1765, pp. 49-51}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in [[North Georgia]]. The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]].<ref name=\"Rozema, pp. 17\u201323\">Rozema, pp. 17\u201323.</ref>\n\nKing George III's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.

Retrieved September 21, 2009.</ref> [[Daniel Boone]] and his party tried to settle in Kentucky, but the Shawnee, [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party that included Boone's son.  The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773\u20131774).\n\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\n\n[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee\u2013American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].\n\n====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref>Mooney, James. ''History, Myths, and Scared Formulas of the Cherokee'', p. 83. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900).</ref>\n\nNotable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of [[James Vann]]), Daniel Ross (father of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts Jr.]]), [[Chisholm Tavern (Knoxville)|John D.

Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\n\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Acculturation====\nThe Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]\n\n[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\n\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788\u20131801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801\u20131811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].\n\nIn 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.  He exported cotton to England, and owned a [[steamboat]] on the [[Tennessee River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2726&hl=y |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Chief Vann House |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Cherokee allied with the U.S. against the nativist and pro-British [[Red Stick]] faction of the Upper Creek in the [[Creek War]] during the [[War of 1812]]. Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\n\nAround 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\n[[File:New Echota.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee National Council building, [[New Echota]]]]\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]). In November 1825, New Town became the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and was renamed [[New Echota]], after the [[Overhill Cherokee]] principal town of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/New_Echota_Historic_Site |title=New Echota Historic Site |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref> Sequoyah's syllabary was adopted. They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the [[Vermont]] missionary [[Samuel Worcester]] and Major Ridge's nephew [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], who had taken the name of his [[Elias Boudinot|white benefactor]], a leader of the [[Continental Congress]] and [[New Jersey]] Congressman.

These were the \n\"[[Old Settlers]]\", the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become [[Indian Territory]] (modern day [[Oklahoma]]).  This effort was headed by Indian Agent [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return J. Meigs]], and was finalized with the signing of the [[Jackson and McMinn Treaty]], giving the Old Settlers undisputed title to the lands designated for their use.<ref name=\"Tenn\">[https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/treaties/ ''Treaties'']; Tennessee Encyclopedia, online; accessed October 2019</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Georgia focused on removing the Cherokee's neighbors, the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Lower Creek]].  Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to a new Indian Territory.\n\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Lenape|Delaware]]\" had suffered.<ref>Wishart, p. 120</ref>  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques.  A modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus and could have accommodated both the Cherokee and new settlers.<ref>Wishart 1995.</ref>\n\nThe Cherokee brought their grievances to a US judicial review that set a precedent in [[Indian country]].  John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from [[National Republican Party]] leaders [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. [[Samuel Worcester]] campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (see [[Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren|Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren]]). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]''.\n\nIn 1831 Georgia militia arrested [[Samuel Worcester]] for residing on Indian lands without a state permit, imprisoning him in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]].  In ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] ruled that American Indian nations were \"distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,\" and entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments that infringed on their [[sovereignty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2720 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: \"Worcester v.

His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim. Ross had the support of Cherokee traditionalists, who could not imagine removal from their ancestral lands.\n\n[[File:Cherokee beadwork sampler 1840 ohs.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Cherokee [[beadwork]] sampler, made at [[Dwight Presbyterian Mission|Dwight Mission]], Indian Territory, 19th century, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]] ]]\n\nA small group known as the \"Ridge Party\" or the \"Treaty Party\" saw relocation as inevitable and believed the Cherokee Nation needed to make the best deal to preserve their rights in Indian Territory. Led by [[Major Ridge]], [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], they represented the Cherokee elite, whose homes, plantations and businesses were confiscated, or under threat of being taken by white squatters with Georgia land-titles. With capital to acquire new lands, they were more inclined to accept relocation. On December 29, 1835, the \"Ridge Party\" signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]], stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation.

On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother [[Stand Watie]] fought and survived that day, escaping to [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn 1827, [[Sequoyah]] had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n=====Eastern Band=====\n[[File:C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright|C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\n\nThe Cherokee living along the [[Oconaluftee River]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements.

A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862.

The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The US government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\n\nThe [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as US citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThe [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative.

Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.<ref>Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57\u20138</ref>\n\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.<ref name=\"Perdue 1999, p. 176\"/> As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the US government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Cherokee ethnobotany]]\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times different, roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the [[clan]]s. As in many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1954047274/|title=Sons of Selu: Masculinity and Gendered Power in Cherokee Society, 1775-1846 - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities.

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\n\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af}}), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9}}) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\n\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be}})  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\n\nOther examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a7\u13eb}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13e9\u13e5}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5}}) or \"big watch\" for ''clock'').\n\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9: \u13c2\u13a6\u13d3 \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb \u13c2\u13a8\u13ab\u13d3\u13b8\u13be \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c2\u13e0\u13f1 \u13a4\u13be\u13d5\u13bf \u13da\u13f3\u13a7\u13db \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2. \u13a8\u13e5\u13c1\u13b3 \u13a4\u13be\u13d3\u13c5\u13d6\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c3\u13df\u13cd\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13cc\u13ca \u13a8\u13d2 \u13e7\u13c2\u13b8\u13eb\u13cd\u13d3\u13c1\u13d7 \u13a0\u13be\u13df\u13c5\u13e2 \u13a0\u13d3\u13c5\u13d9 \u13ac\u13d7.<ref name=\"Omniglot\">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm |title=Cherokee syllabary |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |date=1998\u20132009 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" | [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]]: {{lang|chr|Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.

On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established.

Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.\n\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\n\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.<ref>* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]\n* [http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/default.aspx (Pre-convention \u2013 1999) Oral and Written Testimonies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104091145/http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/Default.aspx |date=January 4, 2011 }}\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/census.htm Cherokee Census Rolls, a follow-up]\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/chapman.htm Chapman Roll Eastern Cherokees, 1851]\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 Treaty with the Cherokee, 1817] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 |date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Cherokee Freedmen===\n{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] -->\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866.

On February 11, 1864, Finnegan's troops defeated a Union cavalry raid in Lake City.<ref name=\"battleofolustee.org\"/> After the Union cavalry was repulsed, Finnegan moved his forces to Olustee Station about ten miles east of Lake City. The Confederate presence at Olustee Station was reinforced to prepare for the Union troops coming from Jacksonville.\n\nUnion forces engaged the Confederates at the [[Battle of Olustee]] on February 20, 1864 near the Olustee Station. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war. [[Union Army|Union]] casualties were 1,861 men killed, wounded or missing; [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] casualties were 946 killed, wounded or missing.

In 1876 the Bigelow Building was completed; it later was adapted for use as the City Hall. The first fire department was established in 1883 to complement the police department. In 1891 Lake City became the first city in Florida to have electric lights from a local power and light company.\n\nWhite violence rose against blacks in the late 19th century in a regionwide effort to establish and maintain [[white supremacy]] as Southern states [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] and imposed [[Jim Crow]]. Whites [[Lynchings in the United States|lynched]] 20 African Americans in Columbia County from 1877-1950, mostly in the decades near the turn of the 20th century.

From 1832 to 1839, the county seat was Newnansville, but that town and area were returned to Alachua County.\n\nIn November 1858 a railroad was completed connecting Jacksonville to Alligator, which opened the town to more commerce and passenger traffic. Alligator Town was incorporated and its name changed to '''Lake City''' in 1859; M. Whit Smith was elected as the town's first mayor.<ref>\"Lake City Florida. Celebrating 150 Years.

It contains three interchanges within the county; the first being I-75 in Springville (Exits 296 A-B), and the other two in Five Points, north of Lake City, US 41 (Exit 301), and US 441(Exit 303). Beyond this point I-10 runs through [[Osceola National Forest]].\n*[[Image:I-75.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] is the southeast-to-northwest interstate highway in the county, which enters from Alachua County at bridges over the [[Santa Fe River (Florida)|Santa Fe River]]. It has four interchanges in the county with US 41/441 in Ellisville (Exit 414), SR 47 (Exit 423), US 90 in Lake City (Exit 427) and I-10 in Springville (Exits 435 A-B).\n*[[Image:US 27.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|US 27]] is another southeast-to-northwest road in southwestern Columbia County, that enters from a bridge over the Santa Fe River, runs through Fort White, and leaves at another bridge over the [[Ichetucknee River]] at [[Ichetucknee Springs State Park]].\n*[[Image:US 41.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US 41]] runs north from High Springs in a concurrency with US 441 until just before it reaches Lake City, Then the two routes run parallel to each other until US 41 branches off to the northwest on its way to Hamilton County, Valdosta, Georgia, and points north.\n*[[Image:US 90.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US 90]] was the main west-to-east highway in the county, until it was surpassed by I-10. It enters the county from Wellborn in Suwannee County, and directly enters Lake City. East of the city, it runs along the southern edge of Osceola National Forest and serves as the address of two major prisons before crossing the Baker County Line and entering a portion of the forest itself.\n*[[Image:US 441.svg|23px]] [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|US 441]] runs north from High Springs in a concurrency with US 41 until just before it reaches Lake City, Then the two routes run parallel to each other, but unlike US 41, US 441 stays in Columbia County and runs straight north and south until it crosses the Georgia State Line.\n*[[Image:Florida 2.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 2|State Road 2]] is located on the far northeast corner of the county, and has no intersections whatsoever.\n*[[Image:Florida 47.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 47|State Road 47]] is a northeast-to-southwest road that spans from Trenton in Gilchrist County to US 41 in Lake City. North of there it becomes a hidden state road along US 41 until it reaches US Truck Route 90, then turns east, only to turn north again onto US 441 where it remains for the duration until it crosses the Florida-Georgia State Line.\n*[[Image:Florida 100.svg|25px]] [[Florida State Road 100|State Road 100]]\n*[[Image:Florida 238.svg|25px]] [[Florida State Road 238|State Road 238]]\n*[[Image:Florida 247.svg|25px]] [[Florida State Road 247|State Road 247]] is a northeast to southwest road that spans from Branford in Suwannee County, and terminates at US 90 in western Lake City, just east of US 90's interchange with I-75.\n\n===Railroads===\nColumbia County has at least three existing railroad lines. The primary one is a [[Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad]] line formerly owned by [[CSX]], [[Seaboard System Railroad]], [[Seaboard Coastline Industries]] and [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] that served [[Amtrak]]'s [[Sunset Limited]] until it was truncated to [[New Orleans]] in 2005 by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. [[Lake City (Amtrak station)]] was Columbia County's only active railroad station until that point.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This third, easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the east channel of the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's impossible to know if Massey genuinely considered surrender or whether it was a ruse to buy time.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 71\u2013</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nOn 10 August, the Royalist army arrived at Gloucester and promptly demanded that Colonel [[Edward Massey]] surrender. Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

He had minor film and television roles throughout the late 70s and early 1980s before creating, and then landing, the role of the know-it-all mailman Cliff Clavin on ''Cheers'' (1982\u20131993), a role he portrayed throughout the show's eleven seasons. His first Pixar role was the voice of Hamm in ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), and he has voiced Pixar characters in films and video games ever since.

He had read for the part of [[Norm Peterson]], but after the audition, he sensed that they were not going to give him the part. Sensing an opportunity, he asked if they had written a bar know-it-all, which the producers decided was a great idea.<ref>''Toasting Cheers'', Dennis A. Bjorklund, p.7</ref> Ratzenberger also came up with the idea for Cliff's trademark white socks, which he wore as a tribute to French comedian [[Jacques Tati]].<ref name=\"joecookprogram.wordpress.com\">The Joe Cook Program (Radio). July 26, 2012. http://joecookprogram.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/john-ratzenberger-interview/ Retrieved July 29, 2012.</ref> Cliff became known for his outlandish stories of plausible half-truths, uninteresting trivia, and misinformation, and in general for being a pretentious blowhard. Cliff and Norm, the primary customer characters, became iconic bar buddies. Ratzenberger provided the voice for an animated version of Cliff on [[The Simpsons (season 6)|''The Simpsons'' sixth-season]] episode \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\".

Mack notes that all the characters Ratzenberger has played were excellent until he realizes that they are performed by the same actor, at which point he remarks, \"They're just using the same actor over and over,\" and asks, \"What kind of cut-rate production is this?!\"\n\nHis favorite of his Pixar characters was P.T. Flea, because \"in real life, I always get a kick out of those kinds of characters, people who just go into a rage for [no] explicable reason. He was always on edge.

He is the only voice actor to appear in every Pixar feature film, and with minor appearances in major films such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', he is one of the [[List of highest grossing actors|most successful actors]] of all time in terms of box-office receipts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacey-alcorn/john-ratzenberger--americ_b_9599966.html|title=John Ratzenberger - American Made|last=Alcorn|first=Stacey|date=2016-04-02|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], Ratzenberger began his entertainment career while living in London in the 1970s. He had minor film and television roles throughout the late 70s and early 1980s before creating, and then landing, the role of the know-it-all mailman Cliff Clavin on ''Cheers'' (1982\u20131993), a role he portrayed throughout the show's eleven seasons. His first Pixar role was the voice of Hamm in ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), and he has voiced Pixar characters in films and video games ever since. From 2004 to 2008 he hosted the TV documentary series ''[[Made in America (TV program)|Made in America]]''.

He had read for the part of [[Norm Peterson]], but after the audition, he sensed that they were not going to give him the part. Sensing an opportunity, he asked if they had written a bar know-it-all, which the producers decided was a great idea.<ref>''Toasting Cheers'', Dennis A. Bjorklund, p.7</ref> Ratzenberger also came up with the idea for Cliff's trademark white socks, which he wore as a tribute to French comedian [[Jacques Tati]].<ref name=\"joecookprogram.wordpress.com\">The Joe Cook Program (Radio). July 26, 2012. http://joecookprogram.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/john-ratzenberger-interview/ Retrieved July 29, 2012.</ref> Cliff became known for his outlandish stories of plausible half-truths, uninteresting trivia, and misinformation, and in general for being a pretentious blowhard. Cliff and Norm, the primary customer characters, became iconic bar buddies. Ratzenberger provided the voice for an animated version of Cliff on [[The Simpsons (season 6)|''The Simpsons'' sixth-season]] episode \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\". Ratzenberger was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 1985 and again in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1985/outstanding-supporting-actor-in-a-comedy-series|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date= 2018-01-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1986/outstanding-supporting-actor-in-a-comedy-series|title= Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Paramount Television]] licensed the look of the Cheers bar to the Host International subsidiary of [[Host Marriott Services]] for use in airports in the U.S. and New Zealand, the group also created [[animatronic]] barflies. They were called \"Hank\" and \"Bob\"; Ratzenberger and [[George Wendt]] claimed Hank and Bob resembled them, and in January 1993, sued Host for using their likenesses without permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=115037|title=Norm and Cliff Fight Cheers Robots|work=go.com}}</ref> The case languished in court for eight years before all sides settled in 2001.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,131242,00.html Bar Association Plus, Norm and Cliff settle ''Cheers'' robot lawsuit] from the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' website</ref>\n\n=== Pixar ===\nRatzenberger has had a voice part in all of [[List of Pixar films|Pixar's feature films]], ranging from main characters to characters who appear in only one scene.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2257378/ \"Pixar's secret weapon: John Ratzenberger], Slate.com</ref> His roles include:\n*[[Hamm the toy|Hamm]] in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' series]] ([[Toy Story|1995]], [[Toy Story 2|1999]], [[Toy Story 3|2010]], [[Toy Story 4|2019]])\n*P.T.

Mack notes that all the characters Ratzenberger has played were excellent until he realizes that they are performed by the same actor, at which point he remarks, \"They're just using the same actor over and over,\" and asks, \"What kind of cut-rate production is this?!\"\n\nHis favorite of his Pixar characters was P.T. Flea, because \"in real life, I always get a kick out of those kinds of characters, people who just go into a rage for [no] explicable reason. He was always on edge. His [[blood pressure]] was always way over the top, and everything that he did was done in a panicked state.

He rode to his friend Alfonso Piccini's house to go training together as on other days. Piccini decided not to go and Bottecchia went to see another friend, Riccardo Zille. He had other things to do, however, so Bottecchia set out alone.<ref>Spitaleri, Enrico, Delitto Bottecchia, Antonion Pellicani, Italy</ref>\n\nTheories abound about the circumstances of his death. Bernard Chambaz of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' said:\n<blockquote>Accident or assassination? The accident theory, favoured by justice, on the accounts of witnesses and a medical examination which also referred to several fractures, was based on an assumption of an illness, sunstroke and a fall. In fact, the inquiry was quickly closed. The theory suited everybody: the Mussolini r\u00e9gime, the presumed killer and even \u2013 it's sad to say \u2013 the family, now sure of a large insurance payout.<ref name=\"L'Humanite July 7th 2003\" /></blockquote>\n\nDon Dant\u0117 Nigris, the priest who gave him the last rites, is said to have attributed the death to Fascists unhappy about Bottecchia's more liberal leanings.<ref name=Startt>{{cite book|last1=Startt|first1=James|title=Tour de France/Tour de Force \u2013 a Visual History of the World's Greatest Bicycle Race|date=2000|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|page=41}}</ref> But an Italian dying from stab wounds on a New York waterfront claimed he had been employed as a hit man.<ref name=\"L'Humanite July 7th 2003\" /><ref name=Startt /> He named a supposed godfather, although nobody of the name was ever found.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMuch later, the farmer who had found him said on his deathbed:<ref name=\"L'Humanite July 7th 2003\" /> \"I saw a man eating my grapes. He'd pushed through the vines and damaged them. I threw a rock to scare him, but it hit him. I ran to him and realised who it was. I panicked and dragged him to the roadside and left him. God forgive me!\"\n\n''Note. However at the beginning of June grapes are unripe and inedible.''\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"Bottecchia was a revelation.
