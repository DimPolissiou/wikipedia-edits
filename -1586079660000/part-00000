She is described as an ''adolescentula ''(young girl), and so it is often assumed that she was about seventeen at the time and therefore born in 1100\u201301.<ref name=\"HC\">''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 66</ref> More recently, however, Constant Mews has suggested that the age of seventeen is a seventeenth-century fabrication with no supporting contemporary evidence, and that she was probably in her early twenties when she met Abelard.<ref>Constant J Mews, ''Abelard and Heloise'', (Oxford, 2005), p. 59</ref> The main support for this is that in a later letter, Peter the Venerable writes to H\u00e9lo\u00efse that he remembers her when he was a young man and she was a woman. Given that Peter the Venerable was born in 1092, it suggests that H\u00e9lo\u00efse would have been in her early twenties.  Mews proposes that this makes more sense of Abelard's later comment that he sought to seduce H\u00e9lo\u00efse because she was the most famous woman in France for her studies, because it is unlikely that she would have acquired this reputation or her command of Greek and Hebrew by the age of seventeen. Additional support for this can also be found in one of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's own letters, in which she says that she was 22 when she and Abelard were parted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Letters of Abelard and Heloise with a Particular Account of Their Lives, Amours, and Misfortunes: Extracted Chiefly From Monsieur Bayle by John Hughes, Esq., to Which Are Added, Four Poems, By Mr. Pope, and Other Hands|last=Hughes|first=John|publisher=Printed for Joseph Wenman, No. 144, Fleet-Street|year=1787|isbn=|location=London|pages= 90, 105}}</ref>\n\nAbelard tells how he convinced Fulbert to let him move into his house, telling Fulbert that he could not afford to live in his current house while studying, and offering to tutor H\u00e9lo\u00efse in return.<ref>''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 67</ref> Abelard tells of their subsequent illicit relationship, which they continued until H\u00e9lo\u00efse became pregnant.

He is never mentioned by H\u00e9lo\u00efse in her letters to Abelard, and Abelard's only reference to him outside the   ''Historia Calamitatum'' is in the verses of advice addressed to him, and thought to have been written about 1135. His death-day is recorded in the necrology of the Paraclete as 29 or 30 October, but no year is given. He is mentioned only once in a later letter, when [[Peter the Venerable]] writes to H\u00e9lo\u00efse: \"I will gladly do my best to obtain a [[prebend]] in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake\".<ref>Betty Radice (trans.), ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 287</ref>\n\nAbelard agreed to marry H\u00e9lo\u00efse to appease Fulbert, although on the condition that the marriage should be kept secret so as not to damage Ab\u00e9lard's career. The reason for wanting the marriage to remain secret is not entirely clear. The most likely explanation is that Abelard must have been in Orders (something on which scholarly opinion is divided), and given that the church forbade marriage to priests and the higher orders of clergy, public marriage would have been a bar to Abelard's advancement in the church. H\u00e9lo\u00efse was initially reluctant to agree to the secret marriage, but was eventually persuaded by Abelard.<ref>''Historia Calamitatum,'' in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), pp. 70\u201374.</ref> H\u00e9lo\u00efse returned from Brittany, and the couple were secretly married in Paris.\n\nFulbert, however, began to spread the news of the marriage, in order to punish Abelard for the damage done to his reputation. H\u00e9lo\u00efse attempted to deny this, but this ongoing situation eventually caused Ab\u00e9lard to place H\u00e9lo\u00efse for her own safety in the [[convent]] of [[Argenteuil]], where H\u00e9lo\u00efse had been brought up. Fulbert and his friends, however, believed that Abelard had simply found a way of getting rid of H\u00e9lo\u00efse, by making her a nun. So, to punish Abelard, a group of Fulbert's friends broke into Abelard's room one night and castrated him.<ref>''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice,trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 75</ref>\n\nAfter castration,<ref>{{cite book|last=Abelard|first=Peter|title=The letters and other writings|year=2007|publisher=Hackett Pub Co|isbn=0-87220-875-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REPM2edtbfsC&pg=PR16&dq=abelard+castration#v=onepage&q=abelard%20castration&f=false}}</ref> filled with shame at his situation, Ab\u00e9lard became a [[monk]] in the [[Abbey of St. Denis|Abbey of St Denis]] in Paris. At the convent in [[Argenteuil]], H\u00e9lo\u00efse took the [[Religious habit|habit]] at Abelard's insistence and much against her own wishes. She eventually became [[prioress]] there, but she and the other nuns were turned out in 1129 when the convent was taken over by the Abbey of St Denis. At this point Ab\u00e9lard arranged for them to enter the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]], a deserted building near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] which had been established by Abelard himself in 1122 (though he had subsequently moved to become Abbot of [[Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys]] in Lower Brittany). H\u00e9lo\u00efse became [[abbess]] of the new community of nuns there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosser|first=Sue Vilhauer|title=Women, science, and myth: gender beliefs from antiquity to the present|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-095-7|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB4OgT8OH7sC&pg=PA21}}</ref>\n\n== Correspondence ==\nAbout this time, correspondence began between the two former lovers. What exists today consists of seven letters (numbered ''Epistolae ''2\u20138 in Latin volumes, since the ''Historia Calamitatum'' precedes them as ''Epistola'' 1). Four of the letters (''Epistolae ''2\u20135) are known as the 'Personal Letters', and contain personal correspondence. The remaining three (''Epistolae ''6\u20138) are known as the 'Letters of Direction'.\n\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse responded, both on the behalf of the Paraclete and herself. In letters which followed, H\u00e9lo\u00efse expressed dismay at problems that Ab\u00e9lard faced, but scolded him for years of silence following the attack upon him, since Ab\u00e9lard was still wed to H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n\nThus began a correspondence both passionate and erudite. H\u00e9lo\u00efse encouraged Ab\u00e9lard in his philosophical work, and he dedicated his profession of faith to her. Ab\u00e9lard insisted that he had never truly loved her, but only [[lust]]ed after her, and that their relationship was a sin against God. He then recommended her to turn her attention toward the only one who ever truly loved her, [[Jesus Christ]], and to consecrate herself fully from then on to her religious vocation.\n\nAt this point the tenor of the letters changes. In the 'Letters of Direction', H\u00e9lo\u00efse writes the fifth letter, declaring that she will no longer speak of the hurt that Abelard has caused her. The sixth is a long letter by Abelard in response to H\u00e9lo\u00efse's first question in the fifth letter about the origin of nuns. In the long final, seventh letter, Abelard provides a rule for the nuns at the Oratory of the Paraclete, again as requested by H\u00e9lo\u00efse at the outset of the fifth letter.\n\nThe ''Problemata Heloissae'' (H\u00e9lo\u00efse's Problems) is a letter from H\u00e9lo\u00efse to Ab\u00e9lard containing 42 questions about difficult passages in Scripture, interspersed with Abelard's answers to the questions, probably written at the time when she was abbess at the Paraclete.\n[[File:Edmund Blair Leighton - Abelard and his Pupil Heloise.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] and his pupil Heloise'' by [[Edmund Leighton]], 1882]]\n\n== Legacy ==\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse wrote brashly about marriage, comparing it to contractual prostitution, although her exceptional and different \"pure love\" for Peter Abelard provides the contextual backdrop for her brash statements.<ref name=\"Newman\">{{clarify|text=Newman, Barbara.

While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational \"monument\" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the [[Bildungsroman]] and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as [[Madame de Lafayette]], [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Choderlos de Laclos]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Dominique Aury]].\n\n=== Early development of the myth ===\n\n* [[Jean de Meun]], the first translator of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's work, is also the first person, in around 1290, to quote, in the [[Roman de la Rose]] (verses 8729 to 8802), the myth of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard, which must have meant that her work was sufficiently popular in order for the readership to understand the allusion.\n* In around 1337, [[Petrarch]] acquired a copy of the Correspondence, which already included the ''Historia Calamitatum'' (translated by Jean de Meun). Petrarch added many notes to the manuscrit before starting to compose in the following year a [[Chansonnier]] dedicated to [[Laura de Noves|Laure de Sade]].\n* The Breton lament song ([[Gwerz]]) titled ''Loiza ac Abalard'' sings of the ancient druidess picking 'golden grass' with the features of a sorceress-alchemist known as H\u00e9lo\u00efse. This spread a popular tradition, perhaps originating in [[Rhuys]], Brittany, and going as far as [[Naples]]. This text and its later tradition associated magic with [[rationalism]], which remained an important component of Abelardian theology as it was perceived until the twentieth century.\n* In 1583, the [[Oratory of the Paraclete|Abbey of Paraclet]], heavily damaged during the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]], was deserted by its monastic residents who disagreed with the [[Huguenot]] sympathies of their mother superior. The Abbess Marie de la Rochefoucauld, named by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] to the position in 1599 in spite of opposition from [[Pope Clement VIII]], set to work on restoring the prestige of the establishment and organised the cult of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n\n* Following a first Latin edition, that of [[Andr\u00e9 Duchesne|Duchesne]] dated to 1616, the Comte de [[Bussy-Rabutin|Bussy Rabutin]], as part of his epistolary correspondence with his cousin the [[marquise de S\u00e9vign\u00e9]], sent her a very partial and unfaithful translation on 12 April 1687, a text which would be included in the posthumous collected works of the writer.\n* [[Alexander Pope]], inspired by the English translation that the poet [[John Hughes (poet)|John Hughes]] made using the translation by Bussy Rabutin, brought the myth back into fashion when he published in 1717 the famous tragic poem [[Eloisa to Abelard]], which was intended as a [[pastiche]], but does not relate to the authentic letters. The original text was neglected and only the characters and the plot were used.\n* Twenty years later, [[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Godard de Beauchamps|Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Godard]] produced a French verse version of Bussy Rabutin's text.\n* Jean-Jacques Rousseau drew on the reinvented figure in order to write [[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie ou la Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]], which his editor published in 1761 under the title Lettres des deux amans.\n* In 1763, [[Charles-Pierre Colardeau]] loosely translated the version of the story imagined by Pope, which depicted H\u00e9lo\u00efse as a recluse writing to Abelard, and spread the sentimental version of the legend over the continent.\n* An edition designed by [[Andr\u00e9-Charles Cailleau]] and produced by the heiress of Andr\u00e9 Duchesne further spread amongst reading audiences a collection of these re-imaginings of the figure of H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n* At the very beginning of the romantic period, in 1807, a [[neo-Gothic]] monument was constructed for H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard and was transferred to the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de l'Est]] in Paris in 1817.\n* In 1836, A. Creuz\u00e9 de Lesser, the former Pr\u00e9fet of Montpellier, provided a translation of 'LI po\u00e8mes de la vie et des malheurs d'Elo\u00efse et Aballard' which was published alongside his translation of the 'Romances du Cid'\n* In 1836, the scholar [[Victor Cousin]] focused on H\u00e9lo\u00efse as part of his studies on Abelard.\n* In 1839, [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], the former minister for public education, published the posthumous essay of his first wife, [[Pauline de Meulan]], as a preface to the hugely-popular first edition of the Lettres d'Abailard et d'H\u00e9lo\u00efse, which were transposed rather than translated into French and in two volumes illustrated by [[Jean Gigoux]].\n* In the same year, the colibri H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Atthis heloisa) is dedicated to her by the ornithologists [[Ren\u00e9 Primev\u00e8re Lesson]] and [[Adolphe Delattre]].\n* In 1845, [[Jean-Pierre Vibert]] created a species of rose named after H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n* Following the romantic tradition, [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]] published in 1859 a version of H\u00e9lo\u00efse et Ab\u00e9lard.\n* In 1859, [[Wilkie Collins]] published the hugely popular novel [[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]], which relies on a similar story involving a male tutor ending up in love with his female pupil, told in an epistolary format.\n* [[Charles de R\u00e9musat]], a biographer of Abelard, wrote in 1877 a play based on the story of the medieval figures.\n\n== Disputed issues ==\n=== Attribution of works ===\nThe authorship of the writings connected with H\u00e9lo\u00efse has been a subject of scholarly disagreement for much of their history.\n\nThe most well-established documents, and correspondingly those whose authenticity has been disputed the longest, are the series of letters that begin with Abelard's ''Historia Calamitatum'' (counted as letter 1) and encompass four \"personal letters\" (numbered 2\u20135) and \"letters of direction\" (numbers 6\u20138). Most scholars today accept these works as having been written by H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard themselves, but some continue to disagree. John Benton is the most prominent modern sceptic of these documents. Etienne Gilson and Peter Dronke, on the other hand, have been particularly important proponents the mainstream view that the letters are genuine, both by offering explanations of the problems with the texts themselves and by arguing that the skeptical viewpoint is fueled in large part by its advocates' pre-conceived notions.<ref>David Wulstan, \"'''Novi modulaminis melos:'' the music of Heloise and Abelard,\" ''Plainsong and Medieval Music'' 11 (2002): 1\u20132. {{doi|10.1017/S0961137102002012}}<br>For what the Epistolae project at Columbia University calls \"a sensible discussion of the problem,\" see Barbara Newman, \"Authority, authenticity, and the repression of Heloise,\" ''Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 22 (1992), 121\u201357.

Cloth, fl. 64</ref> were in fact written by H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard during their initial romance (and, thus, before the later and more broadly known series of letters). This argument has been advanced most forcefully by Constant J. Mews, based on earlier work by Ewad K\u00f6nsgen. These letters represent a significant expansion to the corpus of surviving writing by H\u00e9lo\u00efse, and thus open several new directions for further scholarship. However, because the attribution \"is of necessity based on circumstantial rather than on absolute evidence,\" it is not accepted by all scholars.<ref>[http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/woman/28.html \"Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete,\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013215012/http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/woman/28.html |date=13 October 2008 }} in ''Epistolae: Medieval Women's Latin Letters,'' ed. Joan M. Ferrante (Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning), published online</ref>\n\nThere are similar scholarly disputes about other works attributed to H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n\n=== Relationship with Abelard ===\nThe great majority of scholars (as well as casual readers) have interpreted the story of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's relationship with Abelard as a tragic romance. However, in 1989, Mary Ellen Waithe argued that H\u00e9lo\u00efse was strongly opposed to a sexual relationship with Abelard; according to Waithe, she \"withheld her consent [to sex] and physically and verbally resisted [Abelard's] advances to the best of her ability.\" Thus, in Waithe's view, Abelard's conduct amounted to abuse and rape.<ref>Mary Ellen Waithe, \"Heloise: Biography,\" in ''A History of Women Philosophers,'' vol. 2, ed. Mary Ellen Waithe (Boston: Nijhoff, 1989), 67 {{doi|10.1007/978-94-009-2551-9_3}}</ref> Waithe's argument is based primarily on a sentence from the fifth letter, in which Abelard, in the context of arguing to H\u00e9lo\u00efse that their youthful sexual conduct was sinful and should be repented, not fondly recalled, writes: \"When you objected to [sex] yourself and resisted with all your might, and tried to dissuade me from it, I frequently forced your consent (for after all you were the weaker) by threats and blows.\"<ref>trans. Etienne Gilson, qtd in Waithe (1989), 67</ref>\n\nWhile no other scholar has directly responded to Waithe's claim, other academics come to very different conclusions about the nature of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's relationship with Abelard. Their view is informed in large part by H\u00e9lo\u00efse's own writings (as opposed to Abelard's letters to her), in which she expresses a much more positive attitude toward their past relationship than does Abelard and does not \"accept that his love for her could die, even by the horrible act of Abelard's castration.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wulstan, \"''Novi modulaminis melos''\" 2</ref> A more mainstream interpretation of those parts of Abelard's writing like the sentence Waithe finds so troubling is the one given by David Wulstan: \"Much of what Abelard says in the Historia Calamitatum does not ring true: his arrogation of blame for the cold seduction of his pupil is hardly fortified by the letters of Heloise; this and various supposed violations seem contrived to build a farrago of supposed guilt which he must expiate by his retreat into monasticism and by distancing himself from his former lover.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In fact, even Waithe herself indicated in a 2009 interview with Karen Warren that she has \"softened the position [she] took earlier\" in light of Mews' subsequent attribution of the ''Epistolae Duorum Amantium'' to Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse (which Waithe accepts), though she continues to find the passage troubling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Karen|title=An Unconventional History of Western Philosophy: Conversations Between Men and Women Philosophers|year=2009|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Views on Love|isbn=0-7425-5924-6|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zJOQ52E4GMC&ots=u4lqaL8rFV&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> According to William Levitan, fellow of the American academy in Rome, \"Readers may be struck by the unattractive figure [the otherwise self praising Abelard] cuts in his own pages....Here the motive [in blaming himself for a cold seduction] is part protective...for Abelard to take all the moral burden on himself and shield, to the extent he can, the now widely respected abbess of the Paraclete\u2014and also in part justificatory\u2014to magnify the crime to the proportions of its punishment.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Levitan|first=William|title=Abelard & Heloise|year=2007|publisher=Hacket}}</ref> Thus Heloise's motive in responding to his letter was to set the record straight, that she had been if anything the instigator of their courtship.\n\n== Burial ==\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse's place of burial is uncertain. Abelard's bones were moved to the Oratory of the Paraclete after his death, and after H\u00e9lo\u00efse's death in 1163/64 her bones were placed alongside his. The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.\n\nThis remains, however, disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Ab\u00e9lard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse are buried there and that what exists in P\u00e8re Lachaise is merely a monument,<ref>{{cite book|last= Clannish |first=M.

While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational \"monument\" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards.

She is described as an ''adolescentula ''(young girl), and so it is often assumed that she was about seventeen at the time and therefore born in 1100\u201301.<ref name=\"HC\">''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 66</ref> More recently, however, Constant Mews has suggested that the age of seventeen is a seventeenth-century fabrication with no supporting contemporary evidence, and that she was probably in her early twenties when she met Abelard.<ref>Constant J Mews, ''Abelard and Heloise'', (Oxford, 2005), p. 59</ref> The main support for this is that in a later letter, Peter the Venerable writes to H\u00e9lo\u00efse that he remembers her when he was a young man and she was a woman. Given that Peter the Venerable was born in 1092, it suggests that H\u00e9lo\u00efse would have been in her early twenties.  Mews proposes that this makes more sense of Abelard's later comment that he sought to seduce H\u00e9lo\u00efse because she was the most famous woman in France for her studies, because it is unlikely that she would have acquired this reputation or her command of Greek and Hebrew by the age of seventeen. Additional support for this can also be found in one of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's own letters, in which she says that she was 22 when she and Abelard were parted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Letters of Abelard and Heloise with a Particular Account of Their Lives, Amours, and Misfortunes: Extracted Chiefly From Monsieur Bayle by John Hughes, Esq., to Which Are Added, Four Poems, By Mr. Pope, and Other Hands|last=Hughes|first=John|publisher=Printed for Joseph Wenman, No. 144, Fleet-Street|year=1787|isbn=|location=London|pages= 90, 105}}</ref>\n\nAbelard tells how he convinced Fulbert to let him move into his house, telling Fulbert that he could not afford to live in his current house while studying, and offering to tutor H\u00e9lo\u00efse in return.<ref>''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 67</ref> Abelard tells of their subsequent illicit relationship, which they continued until H\u00e9lo\u00efse became pregnant.

He is never mentioned by H\u00e9lo\u00efse in her letters to Abelard, and Abelard's only reference to him outside the   ''Historia Calamitatum'' is in the verses of advice addressed to him, and thought to have been written about 1135. His death-day is recorded in the necrology of the Paraclete as 29 or 30 October, but no year is given. He is mentioned only once in a later letter, when [[Peter the Venerable]] writes to H\u00e9lo\u00efse: \"I will gladly do my best to obtain a [[prebend]] in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake\".<ref>Betty Radice (trans.), ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 287</ref>\n\nAbelard agreed to marry H\u00e9lo\u00efse to appease Fulbert, although on the condition that the marriage should be kept secret so as not to damage Ab\u00e9lard's career. The reason for wanting the marriage to remain secret is not entirely clear. The most likely explanation is that Abelard must have been in Orders (something on which scholarly opinion is divided), and given that the church forbade marriage to priests and the higher orders of clergy, public marriage would have been a bar to Abelard's advancement in the church. H\u00e9lo\u00efse was initially reluctant to agree to the secret marriage, but was eventually persuaded by Abelard.<ref>''Historia Calamitatum,'' in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), pp. 70\u201374.</ref> H\u00e9lo\u00efse returned from Brittany, and the couple were secretly married in Paris.\n\nFulbert, however, began to spread the news of the marriage, in order to punish Abelard for the damage done to his reputation. H\u00e9lo\u00efse attempted to deny this, but this ongoing situation eventually caused Ab\u00e9lard to place H\u00e9lo\u00efse for her own safety in the [[convent]] of [[Argenteuil]], where H\u00e9lo\u00efse had been brought up. Fulbert and his friends, however, believed that Abelard had simply found a way of getting rid of H\u00e9lo\u00efse, by making her a nun. So, to punish Abelard, a group of Fulbert's friends broke into Abelard's room one night and castrated him.<ref>''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice,trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 75</ref>\n\nAfter castration,<ref>{{cite book|last=Abelard|first=Peter|title=The letters and other writings|year=2007|publisher=Hackett Pub Co|isbn=0-87220-875-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REPM2edtbfsC&pg=PR16&dq=abelard+castration#v=onepage&q=abelard%20castration&f=false}}</ref> filled with shame at his situation, Ab\u00e9lard became a [[monk]] in the [[Abbey of St. Denis|Abbey of St Denis]] in Paris. At the convent in [[Argenteuil]], H\u00e9lo\u00efse took the [[Religious habit|habit]] at Abelard's insistence and much against her own wishes. She eventually became [[prioress]] there, but she and the other nuns were turned out in 1129 when the convent was taken over by the Abbey of St Denis. At this point Ab\u00e9lard arranged for them to enter the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]], a deserted building near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] which had been established by Abelard himself in 1122 (though he had subsequently moved to become Abbot of [[Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys]] in Lower Brittany). H\u00e9lo\u00efse became [[abbess]] of the new community of nuns there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosser|first=Sue Vilhauer|title=Women, science, and myth: gender beliefs from antiquity to the present|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-095-7|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB4OgT8OH7sC&pg=PA21}}</ref>\n\n== Correspondence ==\nAbout this time, correspondence began between the two former lovers. What exists today consists of seven letters (numbered ''Epistolae ''2\u20138 in Latin volumes, since the ''Historia Calamitatum'' precedes them as ''Epistola'' 1). Four of the letters (''Epistolae ''2\u20135) are known as the 'Personal Letters', and contain personal correspondence. The remaining three (''Epistolae ''6\u20138) are known as the 'Letters of Direction'.\n\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse responded, both on the behalf of the Paraclete and herself. In letters which followed, H\u00e9lo\u00efse expressed dismay at problems that Ab\u00e9lard faced, but scolded him for years of silence following the attack upon him, since Ab\u00e9lard was still wed to H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n\nThus began a correspondence both passionate and erudite. H\u00e9lo\u00efse encouraged Ab\u00e9lard in his philosophical work, and he dedicated his profession of faith to her. Ab\u00e9lard insisted that he had never truly loved her, but only [[lust]]ed after her, and that their relationship was a sin against God. He then recommended her to turn her attention toward the only one who ever truly loved her, [[Jesus Christ]], and to consecrate herself fully from then on to her religious vocation.\n\nAt this point the tenor of the letters changes. In the 'Letters of Direction', H\u00e9lo\u00efse writes the fifth letter, declaring that she will no longer speak of the hurt that Abelard has caused her. The sixth is a long letter by Abelard in response to H\u00e9lo\u00efse's first question in the fifth letter about the origin of nuns. In the long final, seventh letter, Abelard provides a rule for the nuns at the Oratory of the Paraclete, again as requested by H\u00e9lo\u00efse at the outset of the fifth letter.\n\nThe ''Problemata Heloissae'' (H\u00e9lo\u00efse's Problems) is a letter from H\u00e9lo\u00efse to Ab\u00e9lard containing 42 questions about difficult passages in Scripture, interspersed with Abelard's answers to the questions, probably written at the time when she was abbess at the Paraclete.\n[[File:Edmund Blair Leighton - Abelard and his Pupil Heloise.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] and his pupil Heloise'' by [[Edmund Leighton]], 1882]]\n\n== Legacy ==\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse wrote brashly about marriage, comparing it to contractual prostitution, although her exceptional and different \"pure love\" for Peter Abelard provides the contextual backdrop for her brash statements.<ref name=\"Newman\">{{clarify|text=Newman, Barbara.

While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational \"monument\" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the [[Bildungsroman]] and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as [[Madame de Lafayette]], [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Choderlos de Laclos]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Dominique Aury]].\n\n=== Early development of the myth ===\n\n* [[Jean de Meun]], the first translator of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's work, is also the first person, in around 1290, to quote, in the [[Roman de la Rose]] (verses 8729 to 8802), the myth of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard, which must have meant that her work was sufficiently popular in order for the readership to understand the allusion.\n* In around 1337, [[Petrarch]] acquired a copy of the Correspondence, which already included the ''Historia Calamitatum'' (translated by Jean de Meun). Petrarch added many notes to the manuscrit before starting to compose in the following year a [[Chansonnier]] dedicated to [[Laura de Noves|Laure de Sade]].\n* The Breton lament song ([[Gwerz]]) titled ''Loiza ac Abalard'' sings of the ancient druidess picking 'golden grass' with the features of a sorceress-alchemist known as H\u00e9lo\u00efse. This spread a popular tradition, perhaps originating in [[Rhuys]], Brittany, and going as far as [[Naples]]. This text and its later tradition associated magic with [[rationalism]], which remained an important component of Abelardian theology as it was perceived until the twentieth century.\n* In 1583, the [[Oratory of the Paraclete|Abbey of Paraclet]], heavily damaged during the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]], was deserted by its monastic residents who disagreed with the [[Huguenot]] sympathies of their mother superior. The Abbess Marie de la Rochefoucauld, named by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] to the position in 1599 in spite of opposition from [[Pope Clement VIII]], set to work on restoring the prestige of the establishment and organised the cult of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n\n* Following a first Latin edition, that of [[Andr\u00e9 Duchesne|Duchesne]] dated to 1616, the Comte de [[Bussy-Rabutin|Bussy Rabutin]], as part of his epistolary correspondence with his cousin the [[marquise de S\u00e9vign\u00e9]], sent her a very partial and unfaithful translation on 12 April 1687, a text which would be included in the posthumous collected works of the writer.\n* [[Alexander Pope]], inspired by the English translation that the poet [[John Hughes (poet)|John Hughes]] made using the translation by Bussy Rabutin, brought the myth back into fashion when he published in 1717 the famous tragic poem [[Eloisa to Abelard]], which was intended as a [[pastiche]], but does not relate to the authentic letters. The original text was neglected and only the characters and the plot were used.\n* Twenty years later, [[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Godard de Beauchamps|Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Godard]] produced a French verse version of Bussy Rabutin's text.\n* Jean-Jacques Rousseau drew on the reinvented figure in order to write [[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie ou la Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]], which his editor published in 1761 under the title Lettres des deux amans.\n* In 1763, [[Charles-Pierre Colardeau]] loosely translated the version of the story imagined by Pope, which depicted H\u00e9lo\u00efse as a recluse writing to Abelard, and spread the sentimental version of the legend over the continent.\n* An edition designed by [[Andr\u00e9-Charles Cailleau]] and produced by the heiress of Andr\u00e9 Duchesne further spread amongst reading audiences a collection of these re-imaginings of the figure of H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n* At the very beginning of the romantic period, in 1807, a [[neo-Gothic]] monument was constructed for H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard and was transferred to the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de l'Est]] in Paris in 1817.\n* In 1836, A. Creuz\u00e9 de Lesser, the former Pr\u00e9fet of Montpellier, provided a translation of 'LI po\u00e8mes de la vie et des malheurs d'Elo\u00efse et Aballard' which was published alongside his translation of the 'Romances du Cid'\n* In 1836, the scholar [[Victor Cousin]] focused on H\u00e9lo\u00efse as part of his studies on Abelard.\n* In 1839, [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], the former minister for public education, published the posthumous essay of his first wife, [[Pauline de Meulan]], as a preface to the hugely-popular first edition of the Lettres d'Abailard et d'H\u00e9lo\u00efse, which were transposed rather than translated into French and in two volumes illustrated by [[Jean Gigoux]].\n* In the same year, the colibri H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Atthis heloisa) is dedicated to her by the ornithologists [[Ren\u00e9 Primev\u00e8re Lesson]] and [[Adolphe Delattre]].\n* In 1845, [[Jean-Pierre Vibert]] created a species of rose named after H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n* Following the romantic tradition, [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]] published in 1859 a version of H\u00e9lo\u00efse et Ab\u00e9lard.\n* In 1859, [[Wilkie Collins]] published the hugely popular novel [[The Woman in White]], which relies on a similar story involving a male tutor ending up in love with his female pupil, told in an epistolary format.\n* [[Charles de R\u00e9musat]], a biographer of Abelard, wrote in 1877 a play based on the story of the medieval figures.\n\n== Disputed issues ==\n=== Attribution of works ===\nThe authorship of the writings connected with H\u00e9lo\u00efse has been a subject of scholarly disagreement for much of their history.\n\nThe most well-established documents, and correspondingly those whose authenticity has been disputed the longest, are the series of letters that begin with Abelard's ''Historia Calamitatum'' (counted as letter 1) and encompass four \"personal letters\" (numbered 2\u20135) and \"letters of direction\" (numbers 6\u20138). Most scholars today accept these works as having been written by H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard themselves, but some continue to disagree. John Benton is the most prominent modern sceptic of these documents. Etienne Gilson and Peter Dronke, on the other hand, have been particularly important proponents the mainstream view that the letters are genuine, both by offering explanations of the problems with the texts themselves and by arguing that the skeptical viewpoint is fueled in large part by its advocates' pre-conceived notions.<ref>David Wulstan, \"'''Novi modulaminis melos:'' the music of Heloise and Abelard,\" ''Plainsong and Medieval Music'' 11 (2002): 1\u20132. {{doi|10.1017/S0961137102002012}}<br>For what the Epistolae project at Columbia University calls \"a sensible discussion of the problem,\" see Barbara Newman, \"Authority, authenticity, and the repression of Heloise,\" ''Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 22 (1992), 121\u201357. [http://monasticmatrix.osu.edu/sites/monasticmatrix.osu.edu/files/commentaria/primary_texts/mm-S4126-newmanm-authoritya.pdf ]</ref> More recently, it has been argued that an anonymous series of letters, the ''Epistolae Duorum Amantium'',<ref>Ewald K\u00f6nsgen: ''Epistolae duorum amantium: Briefe Abaelards und Heloises?'' (Mittellateinische Studien und Texte, viii.) Pp. xxxiii + 137. Leiden: Brill, 1974. Cloth, fl. 64</ref> were in fact written by H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard during their initial romance (and, thus, before the later and more broadly known series of letters). This argument has been advanced most forcefully by Constant J. Mews, based on earlier work by Ewad K\u00f6nsgen. These letters represent a significant expansion to the corpus of surviving writing by H\u00e9lo\u00efse, and thus open several new directions for further scholarship. However, because the attribution \"is of necessity based on circumstantial rather than on absolute evidence,\" it is not accepted by all scholars.<ref>[http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/woman/28.html \"Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete,\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013215012/http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/woman/28.html |date=13 October 2008 }} in ''Epistolae: Medieval Women's Latin Letters,'' ed. Joan M. Ferrante (Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning), published online</ref>\n\nThere are similar scholarly disputes about other works attributed to H\u00e9lo\u00efse.\n\n=== Relationship with Abelard ===\nThe great majority of scholars (as well as casual readers) have interpreted the story of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's relationship with Abelard as a tragic romance. However, in 1989, Mary Ellen Waithe argued that H\u00e9lo\u00efse was strongly opposed to a sexual relationship with Abelard; according to Waithe, she \"withheld her consent [to sex] and physically and verbally resisted [Abelard's] advances to the best of her ability.\" Thus, in Waithe's view, Abelard's conduct amounted to abuse and rape.<ref>Mary Ellen Waithe, \"Heloise: Biography,\" in ''A History of Women Philosophers,'' vol. 2, ed. Mary Ellen Waithe (Boston: Nijhoff, 1989), 67 {{doi|10.1007/978-94-009-2551-9_3}}</ref> Waithe's argument is based primarily on a sentence from the fifth letter, in which Abelard, in the context of arguing to H\u00e9lo\u00efse that their youthful sexual conduct was sinful and should be repented, not fondly recalled, writes: \"When you objected to [sex] yourself and resisted with all your might, and tried to dissuade me from it, I frequently forced your consent (for after all you were the weaker) by threats and blows.\"<ref>trans. Etienne Gilson, qtd in Waithe (1989), 67</ref>\n\nWhile no other scholar has directly responded to Waithe's claim, other academics come to very different conclusions about the nature of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's relationship with Abelard. Their view is informed in large part by H\u00e9lo\u00efse's own writings (as opposed to Abelard's letters to her), in which she expresses a much more positive attitude toward their past relationship than does Abelard and does not \"accept that his love for her could die, even by the horrible act of Abelard's castration.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wulstan, \"''Novi modulaminis melos''\" 2</ref> A more mainstream interpretation of those parts of Abelard's writing like the sentence Waithe finds so troubling is the one given by David Wulstan: \"Much of what Abelard says in the Historia Calamitatum does not ring true: his arrogation of blame for the cold seduction of his pupil is hardly fortified by the letters of Heloise; this and various supposed violations seem contrived to build a farrago of supposed guilt which he must expiate by his retreat into monasticism and by distancing himself from his former lover.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In fact, even Waithe herself indicated in a 2009 interview with Karen Warren that she has \"softened the position [she] took earlier\" in light of Mews' subsequent attribution of the ''Epistolae Duorum Amantium'' to Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse (which Waithe accepts), though she continues to find the passage troubling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Karen|title=An Unconventional History of Western Philosophy: Conversations Between Men and Women Philosophers|year=2009|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Views on Love|isbn=0-7425-5924-6|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zJOQ52E4GMC&ots=u4lqaL8rFV&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> According to William Levitan, fellow of the American academy in Rome, \"Readers may be struck by the unattractive figure [the otherwise self praising Abelard] cuts in his own pages....Here the motive [in blaming himself for a cold seduction] is part protective...for Abelard to take all the moral burden on himself and shield, to the extent he can, the now widely respected abbess of the Paraclete\u2014and also in part justificatory\u2014to magnify the crime to the proportions of its punishment.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Levitan|first=William|title=Abelard & Heloise|year=2007|publisher=Hacket}}</ref> Thus Heloise's motive in responding to his letter was to set the record straight, that she had been if anything the instigator of their courtship.\n\n== Burial ==\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse's place of burial is uncertain. Abelard's bones were moved to the Oratory of the Paraclete after his death, and after H\u00e9lo\u00efse's death in 1163/64 her bones were placed alongside his. The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.\n\nThis remains, however, disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Ab\u00e9lard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse are buried there and that what exists in P\u00e8re Lachaise is merely a monument,<ref>{{cite book|last= Clannish |first=M. T.|title=Abelard: A Medieval Life|year=1999|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| isbn =0-631-21444-5|page=328}}</ref> or [[cenotaph]].

This consists of a stomp-stomp-clap-pause beat, and a power [[Refrain|chorus]], being somewhat of an [[anthem]]. The stamping effects were created by the band [[overdubbing]] the sounds of themselves stomping and clapping many times and adding delay effects to create a sound like many people were participating. The durations of the delays were in the ratios of [[prime number]]s, a technique now known as non-harmonic reverberation.<ref>{{cite web|first= Brian |last= May |title= STAMPING ON PIANO'S? |url= http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbsep07.html |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120722101146/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbsep07.html |url-status= dead |archivedate= 22 July 2012 |date= 22 September 2007 |work= Bri's Soapbox |accessdate= 4 August 2010}}</ref> A tape loop is used to repeat the last phrase of the guitar solo three times as opposed to Brian May playing it three separate times on the recording.<ref>{{cite web|title= Queen's Brian May Rocks Out To Physics, Photography |work= [[Fresh Air]] |publisher= [[NPR]] |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=128935865 |date= 3 August 2010 |accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> The \"stomp, stomp, clap\" sounds were later used in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] song \"[[The Cosmos Rocks|Still Burnin']]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Gary |last= Taylor |title= Detalles del \u00e1lbum |date= 5 August 2011 |website= Queen Online |url= http://www.queenonline.com/es/la-banda/discografia/cosmos-rocks/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110805162627/http://www.queenonline.com/es/la-banda/discografia/cosmos-rocks/ |archivedate= 5 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe music video was filmed alongside \"Spread Your Wings\" at the back garden of Roger Taylor's mansion.<ref>{{cite news|first= Katie |last= Baillie |title= Betty the tea lady can be heard stamping her feet on Queen's We Will Rock You |newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date= 6 October 2017 |accessdate= 16 October 2018 |url= https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/06/betty-the-tea-lady-can-be-heard-stamping-her-feet-on-queens-we-will-rock-you-6981461/}}</ref>\n\nWhen performed live, the song is usually followed by \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", as they were designed to run together.<ref name=\"liv\">{{cite web|first= Greg |last= Prato |title= We Are the Champions \u2013 Song Review |publisher= [[AllMusic]].

The band would frequently use this version to open their live sets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as heard on the albums ''[[Live Killers]]'' (1979), ''[[Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl]]'' (2004), ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' (2007), and the expanded edition of ''News of the World'' (2011). A studio recording of this version is also known to exist, recorded for [[John Peel]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 1]] in 1977. It is part of a longer cut that starts with the original version. In 2002, the fast version was officially released on a promo single distributed by the tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. The \"fast\" BBC studio version can also be found on ''The Best of King Biscuit Live Volume 4''. Between the two versions, there is a brief cut of a woman discussing Brahmanism, used in a BBC Radio documentary. The fast version is also used as the curtain call music for the [[We Will Rock You (musical)|musical of the same title]], after the finale, which is a pairing of the original \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\nIt was the most played song during the 2008\u20132009 seasons of the [[National Football League]], [[National Hockey League]] and [[Major League Baseball]].<ref name=\"BMI\">{{cite news|title= 'We Will Rock You' Is Most-Played Song at Pro Sports Games for '08/'09 Season |date= 28 October 2009 |publisher= [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] |accessdate= 16 June 2015 |url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/we_will_rock_you_is_most-played_song_at_pro_sports_games_for_08_09_season}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Chart \n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|1978\n|France ([[Institut fran\u00e7ais d'opinion publique|IFOP]])<ref>{{cite web |title= Toutes les Chansons N\u00b0 1 des Ann\u00e9es 70 |publisher= InfoDisc |accessdate= 2 June 2014 |url= http://www.infodisc.fr/Number1_70.php |language= fr |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140330183336/http://infodisc.fr/Number1_70.php |archivedate= 30 March 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1992\n{{singlechart|Flanders|45|artist=Queen|song=We Will Rock You|accessdate=2 June 2014}}\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name=\"awards\">{{cite web|title= Queen \u2013 Awards |publisher= [[AllMusic]].

released a cover of \"We Will Rock You\". It was the fourth single released from their second studio album, ''[[Invincible (Five album)|Invincible]]'' (1999). Released on 17 July 2000, the song features two members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]: [[Brian May]] on guitar and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] on drums; however, they do not sing any vocals on the track.

Presented by [[Anthony McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially known as [[Ant & Dec]]), it is produced by both [[Thames (production company)|Thames]] (formerly [[Talkback Thames]]) and [[Syco Entertainment]], distributed by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] every year in late Spring to early Summer. The show premiered on 9 June 2007 following the success of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' the previous year; it was initially planned for 2005, but a dispute between the broadcaster and its originally intended host led to production being suspended for two years.\n\nEvery year, contestants of any age can audition for the televised contest with whatever talent they wish to demonstrate. Auditionees seek to impress a panel of judges - at present, consisting of Simon Cowell, [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], and [[David Walliams]] - in order to secure a place in the live rounds of the contest. Once in the live rounds, participants seek to impress the public and judges to secure votes, in order to reach the final and a chance to win a cash prize and a place within that year's performances for the [[Royal Variety Performance]] before members of the [[British Royal Family]]. {{As of|2019}}, the show has had thirteen winners, ranging from musicians and singers to variety acts, magicians and dancers.\n\nOn average, ''Britain's Got Talent'' draws viewing figures of 9.9&nbsp;million viewers per series \u2013 the show's live final in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|third series]] attracted a record 17.3&nbsp;million viewers, obtaining a 64.6% audience share at the time of its broadcast.<ref name=\"prioryforweeks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/susan-boyle/5434811/Susan-Boyle-could-be-in-Priory-clinic-for-weeks-says-doctor.html|title=Susan Boyle could be in Priory clinic for weeks, says doctor|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> Each series of the main programme is accompanied by a sister show, '''''Britain's Got More Talent''''', presented by [[Stephen Mulhern]]; until October 2019, the programme was aired on [[ITV2]], but has since been moved to online platforms.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, [[Fern Britton]] (at the time, presenter of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''), as well as tabloid journalist [[Piers Morgan]].<ref name=\"Fern Britton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|title=Fern Britton was supposed to be Britain's Got Talent judge|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=13 January 2012|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=28 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234208/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series titled ''[[The Talent Show Story]]'' in January 2012.<ref name=\"Fern Britton\"/>\n\nThe original plan for the show was for it to be aired within 2005\u20132006, before the broadcast of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', with [[Paul O'Grady]] presenting the programme under the title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent'', after having hosted the pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a23450/ogrady-to-host-prime-time-talent-show.html|title=O'Grady to host prime-time talent show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=13 August 2005}}</ref> However, complications arose when O'Grady was involved in a row with ITV and refused to appear on another of the broadcaster's programme, eventually defecting to [[Channel 4]] to continue hosting his teatime show and effectively putting plans for the show on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|title=Paul O'Grady Quits Simon Cowell's New ITV Show!|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=23 February 2006|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=23 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718090610/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|archivedate=18 July 2007}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, O'Grady commented about the row by stating:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|date=5 September 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I did the pilot for ''Britain's Got Talent'' \u2013 which was originally going to be called ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''. But I told the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no way I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can't be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn 12 February 2007, following the success of ''America's Got Talent'' the previous year, ITV announced their intentions for a British series of ''Got Talent''. Their announcement revealed changes to the original plan for the programme, with [[Ant & Dec]] revealed to be the hosts for the new programme. While Cowell remained as part of the judging panel, the new plan intended for [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Cheryl Cole]]. However, both resigned before the programme was due to air, leading to Morgan being part of the panel as originally planned, and actress [[Amanda Holden]] joining him and Cowell as a judge; Hasselhoff would later join the panel for the programme's [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] after being a part of the panel for ''America's Got Talent'', while Cowell later employed Cole to be a replacement for [[Sharon Osbourne]] on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. At the same time, the broadcaster also announced that the show would be accompanied by a sister show on [[ITV2]], titled ''Britain's Got More Talent'', with [[Stephen Mulhern]] as its presenter.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nEach year's competition begins with two rounds of auditions. The first round, referred to as \"open auditions\", are held across several different cities around the UK during the Autumn months, within small venues that are attended by the producers. The second round, referred to as the \"Judges' Auditions\", are held the following year during January and February, within a select set of cities - these have commonly included [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]] - and take place within a theatre or convention hall, whose venue is chosen primarily for having the necessary facilities for handling large volumes of contestants - in particular the venue is arranged into three zones consisting of a waiting area for participants, the wings where they enter and leave, and the main stage area that they perform on. The second round's name is due to the fact that these auditions are attended to by the judges, alongside an audience who secure tickets to attend these sessions.\n\nEach participant that seeks to enter that year's competition must first submit an application to the programme, containing information about who is performing - whether a single person, a pair or trio of performers, or a small or large group - personal details regarding age, hometown, and background, what experience they have for their talent, and the nature of the act that will be performed. Eligibility for the contest is determined by what information is submitted for researchers to double-check - such information is required, per the programme's terms and conditions. Once an application is approved, the participant conducts a performance during an open audition close to where they reside (or can reach), whereupon if successful, they will be allocated a place in the second round, and at a venue that they can reach without issue. Once they arrive at the venue they are assigned to, the participant is then given a number, and remains within the venue's designated waiting area until called into the wings to prepare to perform. Once brought onto the main stage, they begin by engaging with the judges, asking a few small questions - subjects can include their name, background, and nature of their performance - whereupon they are given three minutes to conduct their performance; a backing track for their act is allowed if required.\n\nA performance ends when either the time is up, or all the judges use their buzzers - each judge has one that they can use to signal their dislike of the performance if they believe it to be unconvincing, boring, or completely unacceptable for the contest, though a buzzer can be retracted if the judge felt they used it mistakenly, such as if the participant's performance did something unexpected that changed their opinion of them. Once a performance is over, each judge will give an overview of what they thought about the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of \"Yes\", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated at that point from the competition. Beginning with the eighth series, judges can also grant an automatic place in the live rounds through the use of the \"Golden Buzzer\" situated on their panel's desk - a feature first introduced on ''[[Germany's Got Talent]]'', which can be used by any of the judges for a participant whose audition was exceptional in their opinion, regardless of the views of the others,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2014/02/12/bgt-judges-feeling-a-golden-buzz/|title=BGT judges feeling a golden buzz|date=12 February 2014|work=[[Express & Star]]|publisher=[[Midland News Association]]|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> although it may only be used once by each judge, and cannot be used again for any other participants yet to audition in that year's competition; the hosts of ''Britain's Got Talent'' may also press the Golden Buzzer for a participant, but must also adhere to the same rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a544647/britains-got-talent-is-a-golden-buzzer-a-good-idea-vote.html|title=Britain's Got Talent: Is a golden buzzer a good idea? \u2013 vote|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=17 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/ant-and-dec-couldnt-bear-taking-cowells-place-on-bgt-622489.html|title=Ant and Dec 'couldn't bear' taking Cowell's place on BGT|date=12 February 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming for each series begins during the Judges' Auditions, and always consists of recording taken from each venue of auditions and backstage scenes within the wings and waiting area. Footage taken by production staff is then edited into a series of episodes consisting of montages of scenes from multiple venues, consisting of the most notable auditions - the best, worst, and funniest made - along with interviews with some of the notable participants that auditioned, and recorded backstage scenes of the hosts overseeing the performances from the wings.\n\n===Judges' decisions===\nThis stage takes place after the auditions have been completed, and is also referred to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they will progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.\n\nFor the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]], some acts were asked to perform again, as the judges had had difficulty coming to a final decision on the semi-finalist, and thus needed to see their performance again in order to make up their minds; it is the only time in the show's history that this has happened, and has not been repeated since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/253211-britains-got-talent-shock-as-acts-have-to-perform-again-to-get-into-semi-finals/ |title=Britain's Got Talent shock as acts have to perform again to get into semi-finals &#124; TV: Latest News &#124; STV Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nContestants who make it into the semi-finals by passing both stages of auditions (or receiving a Golden Buzzer, as of series 8), are divided into groups for each round, where they must perform before the audience and judges, as well as on live television. As with the audition stage, each semi-finalist must conduct a performance before the judges - a new routine of their act - with the judges' role being to watch what is conducted and give feedback towards the end of the performance; buzzers may still be used by each judge, and the performance can be ultimately terminated if all buzzers are used. Because all semi-finalists are performing live, they are given time to prepare in advance with rehearsals, while production staff can provide assistance to those in preparing their performance - in the case of those conducting routines that incorporate a level of risk, production staff will ensure precautions are in place, including paramedics, and sometimes set up off-site venues for performances to use either live or for a pre-recorded film for the episode's live broadcast.\n\nEach semi-final can only have two participants advance into the final, and these are determined by two votes. The first is public phone-in vote - via a special phone-number, in which the last two digits correspond to each semi-finalist - that takes place once all semi-finalists have performed and during a break in the semi-final to allow for votes to be made. Once the vote period is ended and the results counted and fully verified, the semi-finalist with the highest total of votes is announced as the winner of the semi-final and secures their place in the final. The second vote involves the judges and takes place after the result, in which they vote between the two semi-finalists placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the public vote, with the participant receiving the majority vote securing their place in the finals; in the case of a tied vote, as of series 5, the semi-finalist placed 2nd in the public vote advances into the final. In addition to these votes, semi-finalists can also secure a place in the finals if chosen as a \"Wildcard\" - introduced in the sixth series, the format allows the judges to choose any eliminated semi-finalist to be appointed as their Wildcard in the finals, through a private vote conducted once the semi-finals are completed; the result of this vote is announced prior to the final's broadcast. The format was later expanded to allow for a Wildcard to be chosen by the public from any eliminated semi-finalist they liked within in the ninth and tenth series respectively, though this format was dropped before the eleventh series.<!-- It is unclear if this will be brought back. Leave as is, and amend if the format returns.-->\n\nThe finals operate in a similar manner to the semi-finals, though all participants in this stage compete primarily to win votes from the public with a new routine; the judges can still buzz and give opinions on the performance they view, but have little impact on the public's voting intention. Once the public vote has been completed, once all finalists have performed, and the votes verified and counted, the hosts announce who is placed as the top two acts of the vote, before revealing the winner who received the most votes from the public. Finalists who win receive a cash prize, and a place in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] later that year.\n\nFor the show's scheduling, the live episodes are usually arranged to take place over the course of a week - semi-finals for each weekday, and the live final aired on the Sunday of the weekend. With the exception of the first two series, the broadcast schedule of live rounds is conducted over two episodes for each - the first focuses on performances, and includes montage clips regarding each participant's background; while the second focuses on the results of the public vote, and, for the semi-finals, the vote by judges, and often include a guest performance taking place prior to the announcement of the results.

In subsequent series, the line-up remained as Cowell, Holden, Walliams and Dixon, with no further incidents except for the eighth series in 2014 - Cowell missed the first day of the Manchester auditions, leading to [[Ant & Dec]] filling in for him, and was also absent for the final day of the London auditions - and the tenth series in 2016 - Cowell was late for an audition, and was temporarily replaced by Walliam's mother Kathleen, who was attending it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width: 50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Series\n! colspan=\"4\"|Main Judge\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Guest Judge {{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"13\" | [[Simon Cowell]] {{ref|2|2}}\n| rowspan=\"13\" | [[Amanda Holden]]\n| rowspan=4| [[Piers Morgan]]\n| rowspan=4 {{N/A}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|2]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|3]]\n| [[Kelly Brook]] {{ref|3|3}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Louis Walsh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=1| [[Michael McIntyre]]\n| rowspan=1| [[David Hasselhoff]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" | [[Alesha Dixon]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" | [[David Walliams]]\n| [[Carmen Electra]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 7)|7]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 8)|8]]\n| [[Ant & Dec]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 9)|9]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 10)|10]]\n| nowrap | Kathleen Williams\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 11)|11]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|12]]\n|- \n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 13)|13]]\n|}\n\t\n;Notes\t\n{{refbegin}}\n#{{note|1}} Guest Judges mainly took the place of another judge during auditions, who were absent during specific sessions for certain reasons (i.e. medical issue).\n#{{note|2}} Cowell was not present for auditions in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]]; he served as a judge for the live shows only.\n#{{note|3}} Brook was credited as a guest judge for this series for the Manchester auditions, after the producers dropped plans for her to be a fourth judge on the programme.\n{{refend}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{See also|List of Britain's Got Talent episodes|List of Britain's Got Talent finalists}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align:center; font-size:100%; width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%; | Series\n! style=\"width:8%; | Start\n! style=\"width:8%; | Finish\n! style=\"width:4%; | Winner's prize {{ref|1|1}} \n! style=\"width:13%; background:gold;\" align=\"center\" | Winner\n! style=\"width:13%; background:silver;\" align=\"center\"| Runner-up\n! style=\"width:13%; background:tan;\" align=\"center\" | Third place\n! style=\"width:10%; | Ave. UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| {{nowrap|9 June 2007}}\n| {{nowrap|17 June 2007}}\n| rowspan=\"5\"| \u00a3100,000\n| [[Paul Potts]]\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" |{{TableTBA|N/A}}{{ref|2|2}} <!-- DO NOT place results for 2nd and 3rd place for this season - there is no evidence stating who got these positions for this season, other than the winner.

In addition, the show had five live semi-finals, featuring a total of 40 semi-finalists.

The series was won by dance troupe [[Diversity (dance troupe)|Diversity]], with singer [[Susan Boyle]] coming in second, and saxophonist [[Julian Smith (saxophonist)|Julian Smith]] placing third. It is the highest watched series in the history of ''Britain's Got Talent'', attracting an average of over 13.3&nbsp;million viewers, with the contributing factor being the performances made by Boyle.\n\n===Series 4 (2010)===\n{{Main|Britain's Got Talent (series 4)}}\nThe fourth series was aired during 2010, between 17 April to 5 June; a single episode of this series, intended for airing on 22 May, was pushed back to 23 May, in order to avoid it clashing with live coverage of the [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League Final]] that year. The auditions were once more held across the same five cities as before, though the series also held auditions with [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]; the city had been originally planned to hold auditions for the previous series, but these were cancelled before this could happen.

Audition took place within Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, and London, with the latter three cities holding open auditions in late 2014 along with Newcastle, Cardiff, [[Portsmouth]], [[Leeds]], [[Norwich]], and [[Bristol]]. The winner of the series was trainer and dog duo [[Jules O'Dwyer & Matisse]], with magician Jamie Raven coming second, and Welsh choir [[Ysgol Glanaethwy|C\u00f4r Glanaethwy]] placing third.\n\n===Series 10 (2016)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 10)}}\nThe tenth series was aired during 2016, between 9 April to 28 May. Auditions were held within Liverpool, Birmingham and London, with all three holding open auditions in late 2015 along with Cardiff, Glasgow, and Manchester. It was the last series to hold live episodes within [[The Fountain Studios]], before its closure at the end of the year.

In addition, the live episodes were now broadcast from [[Elstree Studios]], owing to the closure of the previous site. Auditions were held within [[City of Salford|Salford]], Birmingham, London, and Blackpool, with the latter two cities holding open auditions in late 2016, along with Peterborough, Cardiff, Edinburgh, [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], Manchester and [[Luton]].

Following the previous series, the Judges' vote was brought back into the show's format, while the live episodes were aired from [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and presented solely by Declan Donnelly; although Anthony McPartlin had stepped down from his TV commitments in March 2018, he still appeared in the series' audition episodes, which had been filmed during January and February that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-10/declan-donnelly-to-host-britains-got-talent-solo-as-ant-mcpartlin-temporarily-steps-down-from-his-tv-commitments/|title=Declan Donnelly to host Britain's Got Talent solo as Ant McPartlin temporarily 'steps down from his TV commitments'|publisher=}}</ref> Auditions were held within Manchester, Blackpool and London,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/britains-got-talent/344171-britains-got-talent-2018-auditions-judges-audition-dates-venues-tickets.html|title=Britain's Got Talent 2018 auditions: Judges' audition dates, venues, tickets|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> with two of these cities holding open auditions in 2017, alongside a number of locations within the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, and Inverness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/britainsgottalent/south-coast-bgt-2018-open-auditions-are-coming-to-a-town-near-you|title=BGT Open Auditions are coming to a town near YOU!|website=ITV.com|date=7 October 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The series was won by stand-up comedian [[Lee Ridley (comedian)|Lost Voice Guy]], with comedy singer/pianist Robert White coming second, and singer Donchez Dacres placing third.\n\n===Series 13 (2019)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\nThe thirteenth series was aired during 2019, between 6 April to 2 June. Following his absence from the previous series' live episodes, Anthony McPartlin made his return to ''Britain's Got Talent'' this year. Auditions were held across the same cities as before, including London and Manchester. This series saw three notable events - the withdrawal of an act from the live semi-finals, despite securing a place through their audition; the surprise return of a participant from a previous series' contest, operating under a veiled alias; and the contest being won by the oldest participant to take part. The series was won by singer Colin Thackery, with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name of \"X\") coming second, and magician Ben Hart placing third.\n\n=== Series 14 (2020) ===\nThe fourteenth series is set to air in two parts, the first from 11 April 2020, consisting of pre-recorded audition episodes, while the second containing the live rounds will be aired at a later date. The decision to split the series into two parts was a result of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] pandemic and the resulting lockdown issued by the British government, which made it inadvisable to host live rounds in a time of uncertainty over health and safety in response to the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britains-got-talent|title=Britain's Got Talent|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Related programmes==\n===''Britain's Got More Talent''===\n[[File:Stephen Mulhern.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Mulhern has been the host of the sister show to ''Britain's Got Talent'', since 2007.]]\n'''''Britain's Got More Talent''''' (often shortened to '''''BGMT''''') is a companion sister show that is aired after each episode of ''Britain's Got Talent'' since the main show began in June 2007. The programme is hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], features appearances by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly along with the judges for the respective year the companion show is aired in, and operates in a similar manner to the former spin off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' (the companion show of ''The X Factor''). The format, however, depends on what stage of the competition the main show is on - on the auditions stage is being broadcast, its sister show focused on highlights of acts that couldn't be shown on the main show, with Mulhern operating in a similar manner to the main show's hosts, though with interviews with participants before and after their performance; on live episodes, the sister show conducts live \"after-show\" episodes, featuring interviews with the semi-finalists/finalists, as well as chatting with the judges.\n\nThe companion show used to be aired on [[ITV2]] after each episode of the main show's currently aired series, and also included a special set set of compilation episodes featuring the best and worst auditions from that year's contest, titled ''Britain's Got Talent: Best and Worst'', but on 7 October 2019, Simon Cowell announced that ''Britain's Got More Talent'' would be shifted onto online platforms and thus provide more focus towards ''Britain's Got Talent''. The decision was made due to changes in viewing habits from the sister show's target audience.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fans desperate to save Britain\u2019s Got More Talent after spin-off is pulled from TV |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-10-08/britains-got-more-talent-pulled-from-tv/ |accessdate=8 November 2019 |work=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Britain's Got Talent: The Champions''===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\nIn 2019, Simon Cowell opted to create a spin-off edition of the contest, following the success of the spin-off for ''America's Got Talent''. His plan was to produce a contest under the same subtitle and format as the American spin-off, focusing on bringing the best talent from across the ''Got Talent'' franchise, many from the British edition, to compete for a cash prize and the title of \"World Champion\" in the British public's opinion. Both the contest and the production of the programme began in Spring of that year, with the spin-off's planned broadcast date announced in the 2019 series finale of ''Britain's Got Talent''.<ref name=\"2019 Spin-off\" /> The spin-off premiered on 31 August 2019, with the contest won by dance act [[Twist and Pulse]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Britain's Got Talent'' has been nominated for a number of [[National Television Awards]] in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007. But has lost out to its sister shows ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. [[Ant and Dec]] have won the award for 'Most Popular Entertainment Presenters' at the same awards for twelve consecutive years (as of January 2014). ''Britain's Got Talent'' has also been nominated for two [[British Academy Television Awards]] in 2008, but failed to win any awards. In 2007 and 2008, the show was nominated at the TV Quick and Choice Awards in the 'Best Talent Show' category, losing out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' respectively.\n\nIn 2008, it was a recipient of a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award for its technical achievements. It has also won four [[Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards]] from five nominations. In 2009, it won its first ever Digital Spy Reality Award for [[George Sampson]] for 'Favourite Reality Contestant'. The show was further nominated in the 'Reality Show' category, but lost out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the 'Reality TV Presenter' category for [[Ant & Dec]] and two nominations in the 'Reality TV Judge' category for Cowell and Morgan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2012, electropop band [[Superpowerless]] were approached to appear in the semi-finals. They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light. On the day they felt that all interviews, especially those with Stephen Mulhern, were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation. While many newspapers wrote articles on this topic, very few were published as the news outlets were told that running the story would cut that publication out of any advance coverage of the show in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2013/04/16/britains-got-bullies-bgts-war-on-nerds/|title=Britain's Got Bullies \u2013 BGT's War on Nerds|work=MCM BUZZ \u2013 Movies, TV, Comics, Gaming, Anime, Cosplay News & Reviews}}</ref>\n\n==Live tour==\nBetween 2008 and 2011, several of the show's semi-finalists, finalists, and winners from various series, took part in a live tour titled \"Britain's Got Talent Tour\". The event consisted of several shows held across various UK cities during the Summer months, with site locations including [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Belfast]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Nottingham]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. When the first live tour, hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], was announced on 17 April 2008, demand for tickets for the thirteen dates set for it was high. This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve - the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks - to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston. In 2009, Mulhern hosted a new live tour, which initially featured four dates before it was later increased to run for eighteen shows, and included performances by Diversity, Flawless, Aidan Davis, Shaun Smith, Stavros Flatley, Hollie Steel, 2 Grand, Julian Smith, Shaheen Jafargholi, Susan Boyle, Darth Jackson, DJ Talent and the 2008 winner, George Sampson. In 2010, a third live tour was created, featuring a much larger schedule and taking place across 16 cities and 23 shows. It was hosted by comedian [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Paddy McGuinness]], and featured performances by that year's finalists of ''Britain's Got Talent'' - [[Spelbound]], Twist & Pulse, Kieran Gaffney, Tobias Mead, Tina & Chandi, Paul Burling, Christopher Stone, Janey Cutler, Liam McNally and Connected.\n\nIn 2011, a fourth live tour was created. Hosted by Mulhern, it featured performances by the finalists of that year's ''Britain's Got Talent'' - Jai McDowall, Ronan Parke, New Bounce, Razy Gogonea, Michael Collings, Paul Gbegbaje, Steven Hall, James Hobley, Les Gibson and Jean Martyn.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLean |first=Amy |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/entertainment-in-newcastle/theatre/2011/06/13/preview-britain-s-got-talent-tour-opens-in-newcastle-72703-28868474/ |title=Preview: Britain's Got Talent Tour opens in Newcastle \u2013 Theatre & Arts \u2013 Entertainment |publisher=ChronicleLive |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> However ticket sales were drastically reduced due to low interest in the tour was as a result of the financial climate that year.

Presented by [[Anthony McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially known as [[Ant & Dec]]), it is produced by both [[Thames (production company)|Thames]] (formerly [[Talkback Thames]]) and [[Syco Entertainment]], distributed by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] every year in late Spring to early Summer. The show premiered on 9 June 2007 following the success of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' the previous year; it was initially planned for 2005, but a dispute between the broadcaster and its originally intended host led to production being suspended for two years.\n\nEvery year, contestants of any age can audition for the televised contest with whatever talent they wish to demonstrate. Auditionees seek to impress a panel of judges - at present, consisting of Simon Cowell, [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], and [[David Walliams]] - in order to secure a place in the live rounds of the contest. Once in the live rounds, participants seek to impress the public and judges to secure votes, in order to reach the final and a chance to win a cash prize and a place within that year's performances for the [[Royal Variety Performance]] before members of the [[British Royal Family]]. {{As of|2019}}, the show has had thirteen winners, ranging from musicians and singers to variety acts, magicians and dancers.\n\nOn average, ''Britain's Got Talent'' draws viewing figures of 9.9&nbsp;million viewers per series \u2013 the show's live final in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|third series]] attracted a record 17.3&nbsp;million viewers, obtaining a 64.6% audience share at the time of its broadcast.<ref name=\"prioryforweeks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/susan-boyle/5434811/Susan-Boyle-could-be-in-Priory-clinic-for-weeks-says-doctor.html|title=Susan Boyle could be in Priory clinic for weeks, says doctor|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> Each series of the main programme is accompanied by a sister show, '''''Britain's Got More Talent''''', presented by [[Stephen Mulhern]]; until October 2019, the programme was aired on [[ITV2]], but has since been moved to online platforms.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, [[Fern Britton]] (at the time, presenter of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''), as well as tabloid journalist [[Piers Morgan]].<ref name=\"Fern Britton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|title=Fern Britton was supposed to be Britain's Got Talent judge|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=13 January 2012|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=28 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234208/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series titled ''[[The Talent Show Story]]'' in January 2012.<ref name=\"Fern Britton\"/>\n\nThe original plan for the show was for it to be aired within 2005\u20132006, before the broadcast of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', with [[Paul O'Grady]] presenting the programme under the title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent'', after having hosted the pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a23450/ogrady-to-host-prime-time-talent-show.html|title=O'Grady to host prime-time talent show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=13 August 2005}}</ref> However, complications arose when O'Grady was involved in a row with ITV and refused to appear on another of the broadcaster's programme, eventually defecting to [[Channel 4]] to continue hosting his teatime show and effectively putting plans for the show on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|title=Paul O'Grady Quits Simon Cowell's New ITV Show!|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=23 February 2006|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=23 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718090610/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|archivedate=18 July 2007}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, O'Grady commented about the row by stating:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|date=5 September 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I did the pilot for ''Britain's Got Talent'' \u2013 which was originally going to be called ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''. But I told the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no way I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can't be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn 12 February 2007, following the success of ''America's Got Talent'' the previous year, ITV announced their intentions for a British series of ''Got Talent''. Their announcement revealed changes to the original plan for the programme, with [[Ant & Dec]] revealed to be the hosts for the new programme. While Cowell remained as part of the judging panel, the new plan intended for [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Cheryl Cole]]. However, both resigned before the programme was due to air, leading to Morgan being part of the panel as originally planned, and actress [[Amanda Holden]] joining him and Cowell as a judge; Hasselhoff would later join the panel for the programme's [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] after being a part of the panel for ''America's Got Talent'', while Cowell later employed Cole to be a replacement for [[Sharon Osbourne]] on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. At the same time, the broadcaster also announced that the show would be accompanied by a sister show on [[ITV2]], titled ''Britain's Got More Talent'', with [[Stephen Mulhern]] as its presenter.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nEach year's competition begins with two rounds of auditions. The first round, referred to as \"open auditions\", are held across several different cities around the UK during the Autumn months, within small venues that are attended by the producers. The second round, referred to as the \"Judges' Auditions\", are held the following year during January and February, within a select set of cities - these have commonly included [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]] - and take place within a theatre or convention hall, whose venue is chosen primarily for having the necessary facilities for handling large volumes of contestants - in particular the venue is arranged into three zones consisting of a waiting area for participants, the wings where they enter and leave, and the main stage area that they perform on. The second round's name is due to the fact that these auditions are attended to by the judges, alongside an audience who secure tickets to attend these sessions.\n\nEach participant that seeks to enter that year's competition must first submit an application to the programme, containing information about who is performing - whether a single person, a pair or trio of performers, or a small or large group - personal details regarding age, hometown, and background, what experience they have for their talent, and the nature of the act that will be performed. Eligibility for the contest is determined by what information is submitted for researchers to double-check - such information is required, per the programme's terms and conditions. Once an application is approved, the participant conducts a performance during an open audition close to where they reside (or can reach), whereupon if successful, they will be allocated a place in the second round, and at a venue that they can reach without issue. Once they arrive at the venue they are assigned to, the participant is then given a number, and remains within the venue's designated waiting area until called into the wings to prepare to perform. Once brought onto the main stage, they begin by engaging with the judges, asking a few small questions - subjects can include their name, background, and nature of their performance - whereupon they are given three minutes to conduct their performance; a backing track for their act is allowed if required.\n\nA performance ends when either the time is up, or all the judges use their buzzers - each judge has one that they can use to signal their dislike of the performance if they believe it to be unconvincing, boring, or completely unacceptable for the contest, though a buzzer can be retracted if the judge felt they used it mistakenly, such as if the participant's performance did something unexpected that changed their opinion of them. Once a performance is over, each judge will give an overview of what they thought about the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of \"Yes\", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated at that point from the competition. Beginning with the eighth series, judges can also grant an automatic place in the live rounds through the use of the \"Golden Buzzer\" situated on their panel's desk - a feature first introduced on ''[[Germany's Got Talent]]'', which can be used by any of the judges for a participant whose audition was exceptional in their opinion, regardless of the views of the others,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2014/02/12/bgt-judges-feeling-a-golden-buzz/|title=BGT judges feeling a golden buzz|date=12 February 2014|work=[[Express & Star]]|publisher=[[Midland News Association]]|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> although it may only be used once by each judge, and cannot be used again for any other participants yet to audition in that year's competition; the hosts of ''Britain's Got Talent'' may also press the Golden Buzzer for a participant, but must also adhere to the same rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a544647/britains-got-talent-is-a-golden-buzzer-a-good-idea-vote.html|title=Britain's Got Talent: Is a golden buzzer a good idea? \u2013 vote|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=17 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/ant-and-dec-couldnt-bear-taking-cowells-place-on-bgt-622489.html|title=Ant and Dec 'couldn't bear' taking Cowell's place on BGT|date=12 February 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming for each series begins during the Judges' Auditions, and always consists of recording taken from each venue of auditions and backstage scenes within the wings and waiting area. Footage taken by production staff is then edited into a series of episodes consisting of montages of scenes from multiple venues, consisting of the most notable auditions - the best, worst, and funniest made - along with interviews with some of the notable participants that auditioned, and recorded backstage scenes of the hosts overseeing the performances from the wings.\n\n===Judges' decisions===\nThis stage takes place after the auditions have been completed, and is also referred to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they will progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.\n\nFor the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]], some acts were asked to perform again, as the judges had had difficulty coming to a final decision on the semi-finalist, and thus needed to see their performance again in order to make up their minds; it is the only time in the show's history that this has happened, and has not been repeated since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/253211-britains-got-talent-shock-as-acts-have-to-perform-again-to-get-into-semi-finals/ |title=Britain's Got Talent shock as acts have to perform again to get into semi-finals &#124; TV: Latest News &#124; STV Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nContestants who make it into the semi-finals by passing both stages of auditions (or receiving a Golden Buzzer, as of series 8), are divided into groups for each round, where they must perform before the audience and judges, as well as on live television. As with the audition stage, each semi-finalist must conduct a performance before the judges - a new routine of their act - with the judges' role being to watch what is conducted and give feedback towards the end of the performance; buzzers may still be used by each judge, and the performance can be ultimately terminated if all buzzers are used. Because all semi-finalists are performing live, they are given time to prepare in advance with rehearsals, while production staff can provide assistance to those in preparing their performance - in the case of those conducting routines that incorporate a level of risk, production staff will ensure precautions are in place, including paramedics, and sometimes set up off-site venues for performances to use either live or for a pre-recorded film for the episode's live broadcast.\n\nEach semi-final can only have two participants advance into the final, and these are determined by two votes. The first is public phone-in vote - via a special phone-number, in which the last two digits correspond to each semi-finalist - that takes place once all semi-finalists have performed and during a break in the semi-final to allow for votes to be made. Once the vote period is ended and the results counted and fully verified, the semi-finalist with the highest total of votes is announced as the winner of the semi-final and secures their place in the final. The second vote involves the judges and takes place after the result, in which they vote between the two semi-finalists placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the public vote, with the participant receiving the majority vote securing their place in the finals; in the case of a tied vote, as of series 5, the semi-finalist placed 2nd in the public vote advances into the final. In addition to these votes, semi-finalists can also secure a place in the finals if chosen as a \"Wildcard\" - introduced in the sixth series, the format allows the judges to choose any eliminated semi-finalist to be appointed as their Wildcard in the finals, through a private vote conducted once the semi-finals are completed; the result of this vote is announced prior to the final's broadcast. The format was later expanded to allow for a Wildcard to be chosen by the public from any eliminated semi-finalist they liked within in the ninth and tenth series respectively, though this format was dropped before the eleventh series.<!-- It is unclear if this will be brought back. Leave as is, and amend if the format returns.-->\n\nThe finals operate in a similar manner to the semi-finals, though all participants in this stage compete primarily to win votes from the public with a new routine; the judges can still buzz and give opinions on the performance they view, but have little impact on the public's voting intention. Once the public vote has been completed, once all finalists have performed, and the votes verified and counted, the hosts announce who is placed as the top two acts of the vote, before revealing the winner who received the most votes from the public. Finalists who win receive a cash prize, and a place in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] later that year.\n\nFor the show's scheduling, the live episodes are usually arranged to take place over the course of a week - semi-finals for each weekday, and the live final aired on the Sunday of the weekend. With the exception of the first two series, the broadcast schedule of live rounds is conducted over two episodes for each - the first focuses on performances, and includes montage clips regarding each participant's background; while the second focuses on the results of the public vote, and, for the semi-finals, the vote by judges, and often include a guest performance taking place prior to the announcement of the results.

Following the previous series, the Judges' vote was brought back into the show's format, while the live episodes were aired from [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and presented solely by Declan Donnelly; although Anthony McPartlin had stepped down from his TV commitments in March 2018, he still appeared in the series' audition episodes, which had been filmed during January and February that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-10/declan-donnelly-to-host-britains-got-talent-solo-as-ant-mcpartlin-temporarily-steps-down-from-his-tv-commitments/|title=Declan Donnelly to host Britain's Got Talent solo as Ant McPartlin temporarily 'steps down from his TV commitments'|publisher=}}</ref> Auditions were held within Manchester, Blackpool and London,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/britains-got-talent/344171-britains-got-talent-2018-auditions-judges-audition-dates-venues-tickets.html|title=Britain's Got Talent 2018 auditions: Judges' audition dates, venues, tickets|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> with two of these cities holding open auditions in 2017, alongside a number of locations within the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, and Inverness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/britainsgottalent/south-coast-bgt-2018-open-auditions-are-coming-to-a-town-near-you|title=BGT Open Auditions are coming to a town near YOU!|website=ITV.com|date=7 October 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The series was won by stand-up comedian [[Lee Ridley (comedian)|Lost Voice Guy]], with comedy singer/pianist Robert White coming second, and singer Donchez Dacres placing third.\n\n===Series 13 (2019)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\nThe thirteenth series was aired during 2019, between 6 April to 2 June. Following his absence from the previous series' live episodes, Anthony McPartlin made his return to ''Britain's Got Talent'' this year. Auditions were held across the same cities as before, including London and Manchester. This series saw three notable events - the withdrawal of an act from the live semi-finals, despite securing a place through their audition; the surprise return of a participant from a previous series' contest, operating under a veiled alias; and the contest being won by the oldest participant to take part. The series was won by singer Colin Thackery, with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name of \"X\") coming second, and magician Ben Hart placing third.\n\n=== Series 14 (2020) ===\nThe fourteenth series is set to air in two parts, the first from 11 April 2020 consisting of pre-recorded audition episodes, while the second containing the live rounds would be aired at a later date. The decision to split the series into two parts was a result of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] pandemic and the resulting lockdown issued on the United Kingdom by the British government, which made it inadvisable to host live rounds in a time of uncertainty over health and safety in response to the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britains-got-talent|title=Britain's Got Talent|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Related programmes==\n===''Britain's Got More Talent''===\n[[File:Stephen Mulhern.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Mulhern has been the host of the sister show to ''Britain's Got Talent'', since 2007.]]\n'''''Britain's Got More Talent''''' (often shortened to '''''BGMT''''') is a companion sister show that is aired after each episode of ''Britain's Got Talent'' since the main show began in June 2007. The programme is hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], features appearances by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly along with the judges for the respective year the companion show is aired in, and operates in a similar manner to the former spin off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' (the companion show of ''The X Factor''). The format, however, depends on what stage of the competition the main show is on - on the auditions stage is being broadcast, its sister show focused on highlights of acts that couldn't be shown on the main show, with Mulhern operating in a similar manner to the main show's hosts, though with interviews with participants before and after their performance; on live episodes, the sister show conducts live \"after-show\" episodes, featuring interviews with the semi-finalists/finalists, as well as chatting with the judges.\n\nThe companion show used to be aired on [[ITV2]] after each episode of the main show's currently aired series, and also included a special set set of compilation episodes featuring the best and worst auditions from that year's contest, titled ''Britain's Got Talent: Best and Worst'', but on 7 October 2019, Simon Cowell announced that ''Britain's Got More Talent'' would be shifted onto online platforms and thus provide more focus towards ''Britain's Got Talent''. The decision was made due to changes in viewing habits from the sister show's target audience.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fans desperate to save Britain\u2019s Got More Talent after spin-off is pulled from TV |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-10-08/britains-got-more-talent-pulled-from-tv/ |accessdate=8 November 2019 |work=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Britain's Got Talent: The Champions''===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\nIn 2019, Simon Cowell opted to create a spin-off edition of the contest, following the success of the spin-off for ''America's Got Talent''. His plan was to produce a contest under the same subtitle and format as the American spin-off, focusing on bringing the best talent from across the ''Got Talent'' franchise, many from the British edition, to compete for a cash prize and the title of \"World Champion\" in the British public's opinion. Both the contest and the production of the programme began in Spring of that year, with the spin-off's planned broadcast date announced in the 2019 series finale of ''Britain's Got Talent''.<ref name=\"2019 Spin-off\" /> The spin-off premiered on 31 August 2019, with the contest won by dance act [[Twist and Pulse]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Britain's Got Talent'' has been nominated for a number of [[National Television Awards]] in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007. But has lost out to its sister shows ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. [[Ant and Dec]] have won the award for 'Most Popular Entertainment Presenters' at the same awards for twelve consecutive years (as of January 2014). ''Britain's Got Talent'' has also been nominated for two [[British Academy Television Awards]] in 2008, but failed to win any awards. In 2007 and 2008, the show was nominated at the TV Quick and Choice Awards in the 'Best Talent Show' category, losing out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' respectively.\n\nIn 2008, it was a recipient of a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award for its technical achievements. It has also won four [[Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards]] from five nominations. In 2009, it won its first ever Digital Spy Reality Award for [[George Sampson]] for 'Favourite Reality Contestant'. The show was further nominated in the 'Reality Show' category, but lost out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the 'Reality TV Presenter' category for [[Ant & Dec]] and two nominations in the 'Reality TV Judge' category for Cowell and Morgan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Have a children's show, ''British Children Have Talent''.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Cowell responded to Forsyth, stating that: \"someone, Mr Grumpy, said we shouldn't have children your age on the show\", after the performance of dance troupe Youth Creation.<ref name=\"Jessie J\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-voice-judge-jessie-j-slams-britains-got-talent-for-allowing-children-to-audition-8640591.html |title=The Voice judge Jessie J slams Britain's Got Talent for allowing children to audition |last=O'Brien |first=Liam |date=1 June 2013 |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> [[Jessie J]] joined the debate, declaring: \"I cannot agree with kids having to go through three or four auditions when it's purely for ridicule.

In 2012, electropop band [[Superpowerless]] were approached to appear in the semi-finals. They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light. On the day they felt that all interviews, especially those with Stephen Mulhern, were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation. While many newspapers wrote articles on this topic, very few were published as the news outlets were told that running the story would cut that publication out of any advance coverage of the show in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2013/04/16/britains-got-bullies-bgts-war-on-nerds/|title=Britain's Got Bullies \u2013 BGT's War on Nerds|work=MCM BUZZ \u2013 Movies, TV, Comics, Gaming, Anime, Cosplay News & Reviews}}</ref>\n\n==Live tour==\nBetween 2008 and 2011, several of the show's semi-finalists, finalists, and winners from various series, took part in a live tour titled \"Britain's Got Talent Tour\". The event consisted of several shows held across various UK cities during the Summer months, with site locations including [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Belfast]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Nottingham]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. When the first live tour, hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], was announced on 17 April 2008, demand for tickets for the thirteen dates set for it was high. This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve - the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks - to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston. In 2009, Mulhern hosted a new live tour, which initially featured four dates before it was later increased to run for eighteen shows, and included performances by Diversity, Flawless, Aidan Davis, Shaun Smith, Stavros Flatley, Hollie Steel, 2 Grand, Julian Smith, Shaheen Jafargholi, Susan Boyle, Darth Jackson, DJ Talent and the 2008 winner, George Sampson. In 2010, a third live tour was created, featuring a much larger schedule and taking place across 16 cities and 23 shows. It was hosted by comedian [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Paddy McGuinness]], and featured performances by that year's finalists of ''Britain's Got Talent'' - [[Spelbound]], Twist & Pulse, Kieran Gaffney, Tobias Mead, Tina & Chandi, Paul Burling, Christopher Stone, Janey Cutler, Liam McNally and Connected.\n\nIn 2011, a fourth live tour was created. Hosted by Mulhern, it featured performances by the finalists of that year's ''Britain's Got Talent'' - Jai McDowall, Ronan Parke, New Bounce, Razy Gogonea, Michael Collings, Paul Gbegbaje, Steven Hall, James Hobley, Les Gibson and Jean Martyn.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLean |first=Amy |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/entertainment-in-newcastle/theatre/2011/06/13/preview-britain-s-got-talent-tour-opens-in-newcastle-72703-28868474/ |title=Preview: Britain's Got Talent Tour opens in Newcastle \u2013 Theatre & Arts \u2013 Entertainment |publisher=ChronicleLive |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> However ticket sales were drastically reduced due to low interest in the tour was as a result of the financial climate that year.

''The Sims 2'', like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; the gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. ''The Sims 2'' builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original ''The Sims''. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on [[Shakespearean]] characters.\n\n''The Sims 2'' was released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A [[Porting|port]] to [[macOS]] was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. ''The Sims 2'' is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering ''The Sims 2'' from the [[Ovi store|Ovi Store]]. A sequel, ''[[The Sims 3]]'', was released in June 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|title=Sims 3, next-gen Black, new SimCity & LOTR coming|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=GameSpot|date=November 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001183949/http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Orry|first=James|title=Three new Sims games in development|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=VideoGamer.com|date=November 3, 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927080944/http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''The Sims 2'' was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.<ref name=\"Fahey, Rob\">{{cite news|last=Fahey|first=Rob|title=The Sims 2 sells a million, smashes EA records|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry International]]|date=September 27, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028040610/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|archivedate=October 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  During April 2008, ''The Sims 2'' website announced that 100 million copies of ''The Sims'' series had been sold.<ref name=\"The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|title=The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold|publisher=[[Electronic Arts|EA]]|date=April 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430233543/http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|archivedate=April 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n''The Sims 2'' was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.<ref name=\"gamerankings3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|title=''The Sims 2'' Reviews|work=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=January 21, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224220217/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|archivedate=February 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"metacritic-reviews\" /> By March 2012, ''The Sims 2'' had sold 13 million copies over all platforms with over six million [[Personal computer|PC]] copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling PC games of all-time]].<ref name=\"Top 15 Best-Selling Games\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/587-13-best-selling-game-list.html|title=The Top 15 Best-Selling PC Games Of All Time|last=Ku|first=Andrew|date=20 March 2012|website=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nFrom the neighborhood view, the player selects one lot to play, as in ''The Sims''.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\">{{Cite web|url=http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203114001/http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|url-status=dead|title=GameSpy: The Sims 2 - Page 1|archivedate=February 3, 2013|website=au.pc.gamespy.com}}</ref> There are both residential and community lots, but Sims can only live in residential lots. Sims can travel to Community lots in order to purchase things like clothing and magazines, and to interact with NPCs and townies. This feature was only included in this game.\n\nThe player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into an unoccupied pre-built lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from ''[[The Sims]]'' is [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]].\n\nThe player switches among the \"live\" mode (default) to control Sims, the \"buy\" mode to add, move or delete furniture, or the \"build\" mode to rebuild the house. Buy and build mode cannot be accessed when on a community lot, but can be opened by using the neighborhood view. It is also possible to import neighborhood terrains from ''[[SimCity 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|title=Creating Custom Neighborhoods for The Sims 2 Using SimCity 4|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|work=The Sims 2 website|accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218194527/http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|archivedate=December 18, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in ''University'' or dating in ''Nightlife''. In ''Nightlife'', each date is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, Plantsims, and Witches.\n\n===Sims===\nThe main part of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby several times. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) pregnant before giving birth to a baby.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> During Pregnancy, the belly does not expand gradually. Instead, every day, it \"pops\" to a bigger size. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling adoption service on the phone, even by single parents or old age sims. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a [[teenager]], and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an [[elderly|elder]]. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.\n\nBabies, toddlers, children, teens and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the \"Grow Up\" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Aging can be disabled via cheats.\n\nPlayers will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationships with other people, so that they can be successful in their career.<ref name=\"gamerevolution.com\">{{cite web|author=Colin|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/sims-2|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 29, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227064235/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/Sims-2|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).\n\nPregnancy, toddlers, teens, and elders are new stages of life. [[Young adult (psychology)|Young adult]] is a unique age added with the ''University'' expansion. Teen Sims will become young adults once they are moved to a University, and will be adults once they leave campus, regardless of the reason.\n\n====Create-a-Sim====\nIn ''The Sims 2'', Create a Family is entered by clicking the \"Families\" button in the lower left-hand corner of the neighborhood view, then clicking the large \"Create New Family\" button. Clicking the button labeled \"Create A Sim\" will expand a tab which has the \"Create a Sim\" and \"Make a Child\" icons. \"Make a Child\" will be grayed out unless the family contains an adult male and adult female. Clicking the \"Create a Sim\" icon will generate a random adult Sim, who may be male or female which can be edited by the player.\n\nAs opposed to The Sims, any age besides baby or young adult (which must be made in the University Create a Student) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already finished faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits.<ref name=\"1up's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review for PC|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|work=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 14, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927215738/http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.\n\nThe Sims 2 also comes with The Sims 2 Body Shop, which enables users to create genetics, makeups, accessories, clothes, and Sims, with the help of third-party tools, such as MS Paint, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Wings 3D, and SimPE.\n\n===Social interactions===\nThere are several new social interactions introduced in ''The Sims 2''. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions.\n;[[Social influence|Influencing]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|title=\"The Sims 2 University\" Influence System|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920084610/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Influencing social interactions are introduced in the ''University'' expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the ''Open for Business'' expansion pack. Influence was also in the Nightlife expansion but added nothing.\n;[[Interpersonal attraction|Chemistry]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\">{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Nightlife\" Review|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072615/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:The ''Nightlife'' expansion pack introduces Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These determine the chemistry that one Sim has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to 3 lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the ''Bon Voyage'' expansion pack.\n;[[Anger|Fury]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\"/>\n:Fury is introduced in the ''Nightlife'' expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Fury can be caused by another Sim burgling the Sim's house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.\n;[[Reputation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Apartment Life\" Expansion (PC)|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603043620/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Reputation, which is found in the previous Sims game ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'' is reintroduced in the ''Apartment Life'' expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.\n\n===Careers===\nThere are careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion.<ref name=\"The Sims 2 Reviews\">[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 ''The Sims 2'' Reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103185116/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 |date=January 3, 2009 }} from [[GameRankings]]</ref> Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.<ref name=\"ActionTrip's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|work=Action Trip|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 17, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120907/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|archivedate=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> And now other Careers such as Dancers and acting jobs and vet people too.\n\n===Comparison to ''The Sims''===\nGraphically, ''The Sims 2'' is more detailed than ''The Sims'' and lets players view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', which used [[dimetric projection]] and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in ''The Sims''. In ''The Sims'', Sims are 3D meshes, but ''The Sims 2'' introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim's facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim's features in the in-game Create-a-Sim tool; for example, noses can be made to be very large or very small. Texturing is achieved through use of [[raster images]], though it appears more lifelike.\n\n''The Sims 2'' characters pass through seven life stages \u2014 babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with ''University''), adults, and elders \u2014 with eventual death of old age, while babies in ''The Sims'' only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to ''The Sims 2''. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits as opposed to Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.\n\nSome of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the ''cleaning'' skill (which was a hidden skill in ''The Sims''), a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations.\n\n===Easter eggs===\nAs known, this game had many mysteries, Easter eggs and neighbourhood stories, the most interesting being of Bella Goth's disappearance to [[Strangetown]] where her memory is erased.\n\n===Cutscenes===\nAnother interesting feature was the cutscenes in the [[Sims 2]]. There were cutscenes featuring woohoo, child birth, abduction by aliens, Going to college and graduation in the [[Sims 2: University]].\n\n==Development==\nPreliminary development on ''The Sims 2'' began in late 2000 following the release of ''[[The Sims]]''.<ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.pdf</ref><ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.mp3</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simscommunity.info/2019/01/11/early-development-information-and-screens-of-the-sims-2-have-been-released/|title=Early Development Information and Screens of The Sims 2 have been released|first=Jovan|last=Jovic|date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEA Games announced on May 5, 2003 that the Maxis studio had begun development on ''The Sims 2''.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|title=EA Announces Plans For The Sims 2|accessdate=April 4, 2007|date=May 5, 2003|work=The Sims 2 Press Release|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304122726/http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|archivedate=March 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first shown at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]], California on May 13, 2004.<ref name=announce/> Will Wright admits that while most of the content of ''The Sims 2'' are original ideas, inspiration for its own expansions and constituents spawned from the successes of the first game.

''The Sims 2 Bodyshop'' was also available for macOS. Aspyr Media released The Sims 2 with all ported expansions and stuff packs as ''The Sims\u21222: Super Collection'' for Intel Macs in 2014. The game is available for purchase on the Mac App Store for OS X 10.9 Mavericks and above.\n\n===Console versions===\nThe console versions of The Sims 2 featured local splitscreen multiplayer, a story mode and an option to control game characters directly, as opposed to queuing options as is traditional Sims gameplay.\n\n===Handheld versions===\n\n====Game Boy Advance version====\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version of ''The Sims 2'' takes place in Strangetown, and shares a similar [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] to its predecessors (''[[The Sims Bustin' Out]]'' and ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City|The Urbz]]''). Players are guided through a goal-oriented game based on the [[reality television]] concept in which partitions of the game are divided into \"episodes\". Characters from the previous handheld sims games also appeared.\n\n====Nintendo DS version====\nThe Nintendo DS version of ''The Sims 2'' (commonly referred to as \"The Sims 2 Hotel\") begins with the player's car breaking down in Strangetown. Upon arriving, an anonymous donor grants the player the deed to a hotel which can be operated and customized at the player's discretion. The player's job is to bring life back into Strangetown by encouraging people to come to the hotel, which players can do by upgrading it and making the guests happy. There are several ways in which a player can make Strangetown a nicer place, but is up to the player to find them. Unlike most games in the Sim series, this one takes place in real-time.\n\n====PlayStation Portable version====\nThe PlayStation Portable version of the game is played in third person.  There is more of a solid storyline the player is required to navigate through in order to unlock most of the things available in the other versions.  The option to build your own home is replaced by a pre-built home where you can customize the furniture and decor.  Conversation is carried out via a mini-game function.  The player's character does not age, nor are they able to marry or have children. Relationships are mainly used for the point of solving goals, though a close friend may \"move in\" with the player after progressing in the game.\n\nThe game begins with the player's character driving through the Strangetown desert, presumably 'Road to Nowhere' in their car, when suddenly a flying green diamond (Also known as the Plumbob, the marker and logo of the Sims game) flies towards the player and causes them to lose control of, and damage, their car. Fortunately, the player finds a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage. At that point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player how to talk to NPC Sims, informs the player their car will only take a short while to fix.\n\nThe player is then free to roam around the gas station, and after being introduced to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is 'Secret Hunting' for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop only to find the garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a ride into town and find a place to stay.\n\nThe player informs Police Deputy Duncan about the situation who replies that he can do nothing about it and suggests the player find a place to stay. After having bought Bella's house for pocket change and getting donuts for Deputy Duncan (which happen to have been found in the trash), the player finally gets a lift into Strangetown's Paradise Place, only to find more tasks and mysteries.\n\n===Expansion packs===\n''The Sims 2'' [[expansion pack]]s provide additional game features and items. Eight expansion packs were released throughout the game's lifecycle. ''[[The Sims 2: Apartment Life]]'' is the final expansion pack for ''The Sims 2''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 11%;height:50px;\" | Name\n! style=\"width: 19%;\" | Release date\n!

''The Sims 2'', like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; the gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. ''The Sims 2'' builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original ''The Sims''. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on [[Shakespearean]] characters.\n\n''The Sims 2'' was released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A [[Porting|port]] to [[macOS]] was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. ''The Sims 2'' is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering ''The Sims 2'' from the [[Ovi store|Ovi Store]]. A sequel, ''[[The Sims 3]]'', was released in June 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|title=Sims 3, next-gen Black, new SimCity & LOTR coming|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=GameSpot|date=November 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001183949/http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Orry|first=James|title=Three new Sims games in development|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=VideoGamer.com|date=November 3, 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927080944/http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''The Sims 2'' was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.<ref name=\"Fahey, Rob\">{{cite news|last=Fahey|first=Rob|title=The Sims 2 sells a million, smashes EA records|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry International]]|date=September 27, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028040610/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|archivedate=October 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  During April 2008, ''The Sims 2'' website announced that 100 million copies of ''The Sims'' series had been sold.<ref name=\"The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|title=The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold|publisher=[[Electronic Arts|EA]]|date=April 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430233543/http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|archivedate=April 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n''The Sims 2'' was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.<ref name=\"gamerankings3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|title=''The Sims 2'' Reviews|work=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=January 21, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224220217/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|archivedate=February 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"metacritic-reviews\" /> By March 2012, ''The Sims 2'' had sold 13 million copies over all platforms with over six million [[Personal computer|PC]] copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling PC games of all-time]].<ref name=\"Top 15 Best-Selling Games\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/587-13-best-selling-game-list.html|title=The Top 15 Best-Selling PC Games Of All Time|last=Ku|first=Andrew|date=20 March 2012|website=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nFrom the neighborhood view, the player selects one lot to play, as in ''The Sims''.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\">{{Cite web|url=http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203114001/http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|url-status=dead|title=GameSpy: The Sims 2 - Page 1|archivedate=February 3, 2013|website=au.pc.gamespy.com}}</ref> There are both residential and community lots, but Sims can only live in residential lots. Sims can travel to Community lots in order to purchase things like clothing and magazines, and to interact with NPCs and townies. This feature was only included in this game.\n\nThe player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into an unoccupied pre-built lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from ''[[The Sims]]'' is [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]].\n\nThe player switches among the \"live\" mode (default) to control Sims, the \"buy\" mode to add, move or delete furniture, or the \"build\" mode to rebuild the house. Buy and build mode cannot be accessed when on a community lot, but can be opened by using the neighborhood view. It is also possible to import neighborhood terrains from ''[[SimCity 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|title=Creating Custom Neighborhoods for The Sims 2 Using SimCity 4|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|work=The Sims 2 website|accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218194527/http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|archivedate=December 18, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in ''University'' or dating in ''Nightlife''. In ''Nightlife'', each date is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, Plantsims, and Witches.\n\n===Sims===\nThe main part of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby several times. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) pregnant before giving birth to a baby.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> During Pregnancy, the belly does not expand gradually. Instead, every day, it \"pops\" to a bigger size. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling adoption service on the phone, even by single parents, old age sims or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a [[teenager]], and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an [[elderly|elder]]. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.\n\nBabies, toddlers, children, teens and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the \"Grow Up\" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Aging can be disabled via cheats.\n\nPlayers will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationships with other people, so that they can be successful in their career.<ref name=\"gamerevolution.com\">{{cite web|author=Colin|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/sims-2|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 29, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227064235/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/Sims-2|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).\n\nPregnancy, toddlers, teens, and elders are new stages of life. [[Young adult (psychology)|Young adult]] is a unique age added with the ''University'' expansion. Teen Sims will become young adults once they are moved to a University, and will be adults once they leave campus, regardless of the reason.\n\n====Create-a-Sim====\nIn ''The Sims 2'', Create a Family is entered by clicking the \"Families\" button in the lower left-hand corner of the neighborhood view, then clicking the large \"Create New Family\" button. Clicking the button labeled \"Create A Sim\" will expand a tab which has the \"Create a Sim\" and \"Make a Child\" icons. \"Make a Child\" will be grayed out unless the family contains an adult male and adult female. Clicking the \"Create a Sim\" icon will generate a random adult Sim, who may be male or female which can be edited by the player.\n\nAs opposed to The Sims, any age besides baby or young adult (which must be made in the University Create a Student) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already finished faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits.<ref name=\"1up's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review for PC|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|work=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 14, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927215738/http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.\n\nThe Sims 2 also comes with The Sims 2 Body Shop, which enables users to create genetics, makeups, accessories, clothes, and Sims, with the help of third-party tools, such as MS Paint, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Wings 3D, and SimPE.\n\n===Social interactions===\nThere are several new social interactions introduced in ''The Sims 2''. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions.\n;[[Social influence|Influencing]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|title=\"The Sims 2 University\" Influence System|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920084610/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Influencing social interactions are introduced in the ''University'' expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the ''Open for Business'' expansion pack. Influence was also in the Nightlife expansion but added nothing.\n;[[Interpersonal attraction|Chemistry]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\">{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Nightlife\" Review|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072615/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:The ''Nightlife'' expansion pack introduces Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These determine the chemistry that one Sim has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to 3 lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the ''Bon Voyage'' expansion pack.\n;[[Anger|Fury]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\"/>\n:Fury is introduced in the ''Nightlife'' expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Fury can be caused by another Sim burgling the Sim's house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.\n;[[Reputation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Apartment Life\" Expansion (PC)|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603043620/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Reputation, which is found in the previous Sims game ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'' is reintroduced in the ''Apartment Life'' expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.\n\n===Careers===\nThere are careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion.<ref name=\"The Sims 2 Reviews\">[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 ''The Sims 2'' Reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103185116/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 |date=January 3, 2009 }} from [[GameRankings]]</ref> Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.<ref name=\"ActionTrip's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|work=Action Trip|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 17, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120907/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|archivedate=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> And now other Careers such as Dancers and acting jobs and vet people too.\n\n===Comparison to ''The Sims''===\nGraphically, ''The Sims 2'' is more detailed than ''The Sims'' and lets players view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', which used [[dimetric projection]] and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in ''The Sims''. In ''The Sims'', Sims are 3D meshes, but ''The Sims 2'' introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim's facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim's features in the in-game Create-a-Sim tool; for example, noses can be made to be very large or very small. Texturing is achieved through use of [[raster images]], though it appears more lifelike.\n\n''The Sims 2'' characters pass through seven life stages \u2014 babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with ''University''), adults, and elders \u2014 with eventual death of old age, while babies in ''The Sims'' only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to ''The Sims 2''. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits as opposed to Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.\n\nSome of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the ''cleaning'' skill (which was a hidden skill in ''The Sims''), a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations.\n\n===Easter eggs===\nAs known, this game had many mysteries, Easter eggs and neighbourhood stories, the most interesting being of Bella Goth's disappearance to [[Strangetown]] where her memory is erased.\n\n===Cutscenes===\nAnother interesting feature was the cutscenes in the [[Sims 2]]. There were cutscenes featuring woohoo, child birth, abduction by aliens, Going to college and graduation in the [[Sims 2: University]].\n\n==Development==\nPreliminary development on ''The Sims 2'' began in late 2000 following the release of ''[[The Sims]]''.<ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.pdf</ref><ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.mp3</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simscommunity.info/2019/01/11/early-development-information-and-screens-of-the-sims-2-have-been-released/|title=Early Development Information and Screens of The Sims 2 have been released|first=Jovan|last=Jovic|date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEA Games announced on May 5, 2003 that the Maxis studio had begun development on ''The Sims 2''.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|title=EA Announces Plans For The Sims 2|accessdate=April 4, 2007|date=May 5, 2003|work=The Sims 2 Press Release|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304122726/http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|archivedate=March 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first shown at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]], California on May 13, 2004.<ref name=announce/> Will Wright admits that while most of the content of ''The Sims 2'' are original ideas, inspiration for its own expansions and constituents spawned from the successes of the first game.

''The Sims 2 Bodyshop'' was also available for macOS. Aspyr Media released The Sims 2 with all ported expansions and stuff packs as ''The Sims\u21222: Super Collection'' for Intel Macs in 2014. The game is available for purchase on the Mac App Store for OS X 10.9 Mavericks and above.\n\n===Console versions===\nThe console versions of The Sims 2 featured local splitscreen multiplayer, a story mode and an option to control game characters directly, as opposed to queuing options as is traditional Sims gameplay.\n\n===Handheld versions===\n\n====Game Boy Advance version====\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version of ''The Sims 2'' takes place in Strangetown, and shares a similar [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] to its predecessors (''[[The Sims Bustin' Out]]'' and ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City|The Urbz]]''). Players are guided through a goal-oriented game based on the [[reality television]] concept in which partitions of the game are divided into \"episodes\". Characters from the previous handheld sims games also appeared.\n\n====Nintendo DS version====\nThe Nintendo DS version of ''The Sims 2'' (commonly referred to as \"The Sims 2 Hotel\") begins with the player's car breaking down in Strangetown. Upon arriving, an anonymous donor grants the player the deed to a hotel which can be operated and customized at the player's discretion. The player's job is to bring life back into Strangetown by encouraging people to come to the hotel, which players can do by upgrading it and making the guests happy. There are several ways in which a player can make Strangetown a nicer place, but is up to the player to find them. Unlike most games in the Sim series, this one takes place in real-time.\n\n====PlayStation Portable version====\nThe PlayStation Portable version of the game is played in third person.  There is more of a solid storyline the player is required to navigate through in order to unlock most of the things available in the other versions.  The option to build your own home is replaced by a pre-built home where you can customize the furniture and decor.  Conversation is carried out via a mini-game function.  The player's character does not age, nor are they able to marry or have children. Relationships are mainly used for the point of solving goals, though a close friend may \"move in\" with the player after progressing in the game.\n\nThe game begins with the player's character driving through the Strangetown desert, presumably 'Road to Nowhere' in their car, when suddenly a flying green diamond (Also known as the Plumbob, the marker and logo of the Sims game) flies towards the player and causes them to lose control of, and damage, their car. Fortunately, the player finds a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage. At that point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player how to talk to NPC Sims, informs the player their car will only take a short while to fix.\n\nThe player is then free to roam around the gas station, and after being introduced to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is 'Secret Hunting' for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop only to find the garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a ride into town and find a place to stay.\n\nThe player informs Police Deputy Duncan about the situation who replies that he can do nothing about it and suggests the player find a place to stay. After having bought Bella's house for pocket change and getting donuts for Deputy Duncan (which happen to have been found in the trash), the player finally gets a lift into Strangetown's Paradise Place, only to find more tasks and mysteries.\n\n===Expansion packs===\n''The Sims 2'' [[expansion pack]]s provide additional game features and items. Eight expansion packs were released throughout the game's lifecycle. ''[[The Sims 2: Apartment Life]]'' is the final expansion pack for ''The Sims 2''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 11%;height:50px;\" | Name\n! style=\"width: 19%;\" | Release date\n!

Before the creation of the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] in 1926, the highway had been designated as a state highway numbered '''M-16'''. The modern route of Grand River Avenue cuts across the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] in a northwest\u2013southeast fashion from near [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to [[Detroit]]. Before the late 1950s and early 1960s, US&nbsp;16 followed other roads between [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]] and Grand Rapids, and then Grand River Avenue through [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] to Detroit. In the years immediately preceding the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]], US&nbsp;16 was shifted from older roads to newer freeways. Later, it was [[concurrency (road)|co-designated]] as an Interstate. When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing, the US&nbsp;16 [[decommissioned highway|designation was decommissioned]] in the state. The freeway was solely designated [[Interstate 96]] (I-96) east of Grand Rapids and [[Interstate 196|I-196]] west of that city.\n\nThe original pathway along the Grand River Avenue corridor was an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] trail, a footpath used by the native population. The first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan also used this trail and in some areas enlarged it for the passage of wagons. In Detroit, Grand River is one of five major avenues (along with [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward]], [[Michigan Avenue (Michigan)|Michigan]], [[Gratiot Avenue|Gratiot]], and [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson]]) planned by Judge [[Augustus Woodward]] in 1805 that extended from [[Downtown Detroit]] in differing radial directions; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city's downtown. In the middle of the 19th century, the trail was expanded into a [[plank road]] that formed the basis for one of the first [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highways]] as M-16 in the early 20th century. Later, the highway was rerouted to replace '''M-126''' and create [[M-104 (Michigan highway)|M-104]]. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of [[M-5 (Michigan highway)|M-5]], [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]], [[M-43 (Michigan highway)|M-43]] or [[Business routes of Interstate 96|business loops off I-96]]. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as [[Interstate 96 Business (Detroit, Michigan)|Old Business Spur I-96]] (Old BS I-96).\n\n==Route description==\nAt the time of its decommissioning, US&nbsp;16 started its run through Michigan at the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] docks in Muskegon. The [[SS Milwaukee Clipper|SS ''Milwaukee Clipper'']] operated as a [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferry]] across [[Lake Michigan]], connecting Muskegon to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], where US&nbsp;16 continued to the west. From the docks, US&nbsp;16 and [[M-46 (Michigan highway)|M-46]] [[concurrency (road)|traveled concurrently]] south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US&nbsp;16 turned south along [[U.S. Route 31 Business (Muskegon, Michigan)|Business US&nbsp;31]] (Bus. US&nbsp;31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through [[Muskegon Heights, Michigan|Muskegon Heights]] to [[Norton Shores, Michigan|Norton Shores]]. There, the business loop ended at [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]], and US&nbsp;16 joined the [[Interstate 196|I-196]] freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped,<ref name=numbers>{{cite news |work = [[Holland Sentinel|The Holland Evening Sentinel]] |title = New Numbers Seen for Road |page = 4 |date = October 23, 1963 |agency = [[United Press International]] |issn = 1050-4044 |oclc = 13440201 |url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10217809/new_numbers_seen_for_road/ |access-date = April 12, 2016 |via = Newspapers.com }} {{open access}}</ref> but at the time leading up to US&nbsp;16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.<ref name=shift>{{cite news |title = Would Shift Route Number: Mackie Seeks Int. 96 Designation for Grand Rapids\u2013Muskegon Stretch |work = [[The Grand Rapids Press]] |date = May 1, 1963 |page = 32 |oclc = 9975013 }}</ref>) The I-196/US&nbsp;16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural [[Muskegon County, Michigan|Muskegon County]] parallel to the former US&nbsp;16 routing through [[Fruitport, Michigan|Fruitport]] to [[Nunica, Michigan|Nunica]] in [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]]. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of [[M-104 (Michigan highway)|M-104]], and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of [[Coopersville, Michigan|Coopersville]] and [[Marne, Michigan|Marne]].<ref name=MSHD62>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1962 |link= yes |sections=K8\u2013M14 }}</ref>\n\nAs the freeway approached [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]], it met the western terminus of [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]] which was the former routing of US&nbsp;16 through the [[Grand Rapids metropolitan area]]. I-196/US&nbsp;16 continued eastward around the north side of the metropolitan area through the suburbs of [[Walker, Michigan|Walker]] and [[Comstock Park, Michigan|Comstock Park]]. The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]] along the East Beltline and curved south through the eastern edge of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to meet the end of I-96 east of downtown. There I-196 ended and US&nbsp;16 was transferred to the I-96 freeway. I-96/US&nbsp;16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road, which was previously US&nbsp;16. Cascade Road east of this interchange meets the westernmost part of Grand River Avenue, which carried US&nbsp;16 east continuously to [[Downtown Detroit]].<ref name=MSHD62/>{{#tag:ref|Grand River Avenue ends at Cascade Road, but the historic routing carried it through [[Ada, Michigan|Ada]] and [[Plainfield Township, Kent County, Michigan|Plainfield Township]] along the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]].

M-50 departed to the south near [[Lowell, Michigan|Lowell]], and the freeway crossed into southern [[Ionia County, Michigan|Ionia County]]. Passing south of [[Portland, Michigan|Portland]], the freeway crossed east into [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]]. North of [[Grand Ledge, Michigan|Grand Ledge]], I-96 ended and US&nbsp;16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US&nbsp;16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the [[Lansing Capital City Airport|Capital City Airport]] and east to Larch Street, where US&nbsp;16 turned south along [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]] north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US&nbsp;16 turned east on the [[one-way traffic|one-way street]], while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at the east end of Saginaw Street in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]]. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of [[Michigan State University]] to the south and the rest of the city to the north. US&nbsp;16 continued east in [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]] through [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]] and rural parts of the county through [[Williamston, Michigan|Williamston]] and [[Webberville, Michigan|Webberville]].<ref name=MSHD62/>\n\n[[File:M-43 Grand River Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Modern M-43 running along Grand River Avenue at Collingwood Drive in East Lansing (2008)]]\nGrand River Avenue crosses to the east into [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] through [[Fowlerville, Michigan|Fowlerville]] to [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]. In Howell, Grand River Avenue meets Hartland Road which carries [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]]; the highway also met [[M-155 (Michigan highway)|M-155]] in downtown, which at the time provided access to the Howell State Hospital. In the approach to [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]], Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway. US&nbsp;16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US&nbsp;16 met the northern end of the [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]] freeway. I-96/US&nbsp;16 continued east into [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] through [[Wixom, Michigan|Wixom]] and [[Novi, Michigan|Novi]].<ref name=MSHD62/>\n\nNear [[Farmington, Michigan|Farmington]], I-96/US&nbsp;16 continued to the southeast of the present-day I-96/[[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]]/[[Interstate 696|I-696]]/[[M-5 (Michigan highway)|M-5]] interchange along the current M-5 freeway. Grand River Avenue through there was [[Interstate 96 Business (Farmington, Michigan)|Business Loop I-96]] (BL&nbsp;I-96). The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also marked the end of the business loop and the eastern end of I-96 at the time.

Vandenberg]] was appointed to the [[United States Senate]] upon the death in office of [[Woodbridge N. Ferris]] in 1928. Vandenberg, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], served as a member of the \"isolationist bloc\", and was an active opponent of the [[New Deal]] policies of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The senator declined a nomination for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in 1936. In the aftermath of World War II, Vandenberg's world view changed significantly. He helped to draft the [[United Nations Charter]] and worked to secure is unanimous ratification in the Senate. He also worked to secure passage of the [[Marshall Plan]] and helped to establish the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]. After his death in 1951, Michigan residents wanted to memorialize Vandenberg. The following year, the [[Michigan Legislature]] dedicated the length of US&nbsp;16 from Muskegon to Detroit as the Arthur Vandenberg Memorial Highway by enacting Public Act 70 of 1952.<ref>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|pp=25\u201326}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|thumb|right|x150px|George Washington|alt=Portrait]]\nVandenberg was not the only national figure honored with a memorial designation along the route of US&nbsp;16 in Michigan. For a period from the 1930s through the 1950s, the highway used a few blocks of Washington Boulevard to connect between Grand River and Michigan avenues on its route through Detroit to its terminus at [[Cadillac Square]]. This street was named in honor of [[George Washington]] for his service as the \"father of his country\".

Before the creation of the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] in 1926, the highway had been designated as a state highway numbered '''M-16'''. The modern route of Grand River Avenue cuts across the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] in a northwest\u2013southeast fashion from near [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to [[Detroit]]. Before the late 1950s and early 1960s, US&nbsp;16 followed other roads between [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]] and Grand Rapids, and then Grand River Avenue through [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] to Detroit. In the years immediately preceding the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]], US&nbsp;16 was shifted from older roads to newer freeways. Later, it was [[concurrency (road)|co-designated]] as an Interstate. When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing, the US&nbsp;16 [[decommissioned highway|designation was decommissioned]] in the state. The freeway was solely designated [[Interstate 96]] (I-96) east of Grand Rapids and [[Interstate 196|I-196]] west of that city.\n\nThe original pathway along the Grand River Avenue corridor was an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] trail, a footpath used by the native population. The first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan also used this trail and in some areas enlarged it for the passage of wagons. In Detroit, Grand River is one of five major avenues (along with [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward]], [[Michigan Avenue (Michigan)|Michigan]], [[Gratiot Avenue|Gratiot]], and [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson]]) planned by Judge [[Augustus Woodward]] in 1805 that extended from [[Downtown Detroit]] in differing radial directions; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city's downtown. In the middle of the 19th century, the trail was expanded into a [[plank road]] that formed the basis for one of the first [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highways]] as M-16 in the early 20th century. Later, the highway was rerouted to replace '''M-126''' and create [[M-104 (Michigan highway)|M-104]]. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of [[M-5 (Michigan highway)|M-5]], [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]], [[M-43 (Michigan highway)|M-43]] or [[Business routes of Interstate 96|business loops off I-96]]. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as [[Interstate 96 Business (Detroit, Michigan)|Old Business Spur I-96]] (Old BS I-96).\n\n==Route description==\nAt the time of its decommissioning, US&nbsp;16 started its run through Michigan at the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] docks in Muskegon. The [[SS Milwaukee Clipper|SS ''Milwaukee Clipper'']] operated as a [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferry]] across [[Lake Michigan]], connecting Muskegon to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], where US&nbsp;16 continued to the west. From the docks, US&nbsp;16 and [[M-46 (Michigan highway)|M-46]] [[concurrency (road)|traveled concurrently]] south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US&nbsp;16 turned south along [[U.S. Route 31 Business (Muskegon, Michigan)|Business US&nbsp;31]] (Bus. US&nbsp;31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through [[Muskegon Heights, Michigan|Muskegon Heights]] to [[Norton Shores, Michigan|Norton Shores]]. There, the business loop ended at [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]], and US&nbsp;16 joined the [[Interstate 196|I-196]] freeway headed east.

The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of [[M-104 (Michigan highway)|M-104]], and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of [[Coopersville, Michigan|Coopersville]] and [[Marne, Michigan|Marne]].<ref name=MSHD62>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1962 |link= yes |sections=K8\u2013M14 }}</ref>\n\nAs the freeway approached [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]], it met the western terminus of [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]] which was the former routing of US&nbsp;16 through the [[Grand Rapids metropolitan area]]. I-196/US&nbsp;16 continued eastward around the north side of the metropolitan area through the suburbs of [[Walker, Michigan|Walker]] and [[Comstock Park, Michigan|Comstock Park]]. The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]] along the East Beltline and curved south through the eastern edge of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to meet the end of I-96 east of downtown. There I-196 ended and US&nbsp;16 was transferred to the I-96 freeway. I-96/US&nbsp;16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road, which was previously US&nbsp;16.

M-50 departed to the south near [[Lowell, Michigan|Lowell]], and the freeway crossed into southern [[Ionia County, Michigan|Ionia County]]. Passing south of [[Portland, Michigan|Portland]], the freeway crossed east into [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]]. North of [[Grand Ledge, Michigan|Grand Ledge]], I-96 ended and US&nbsp;16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US&nbsp;16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the [[Lansing Capital City Airport|Capital City Airport]] and east to Larch Street, where US&nbsp;16 turned south along [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]] north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US&nbsp;16 turned east on the [[one-way traffic|one-way street]], while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at the east end of Saginaw Street in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]]. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of [[Michigan State University]] to the south and the rest of the city to the north. US&nbsp;16 continued east in [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]] through [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]] and rural parts of the county through [[Williamston, Michigan|Williamston]] and [[Webberville, Michigan|Webberville]].<ref name=MSHD62/>\n\n[[File:M-43 Grand River Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Modern M-43 running along Grand River Avenue at Collingwood Drive in East Lansing (2008)]]\nGrand River Avenue crosses to the east into [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] through [[Fowlerville, Michigan|Fowlerville]] to [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]. In Howell, Grand River Avenue meets Hartland Road which carries [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]]; the highway also met [[M-155 (Michigan highway)|M-155]] in downtown, which at the time provided access to the Howell State Hospital. In the approach to [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]], Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway. US&nbsp;16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US&nbsp;16 met the northern end of the [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]] freeway.

Grand River Avenue through there was [[Interstate 96 Business (Farmington, Michigan)|Business Loop I-96]] (BL&nbsp;I-96). The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also marked the end of the business loop and the eastern end of I-96 at the time. From there, US&nbsp;16 continued along Grand River Avenue the rest of way into Downtown Detroit. Along that routing, it intersected [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]] at Telegraph Road and [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|M-39]] at Southfield Road. [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] joined US&nbsp;16 along Grand River Avenue at Plymouth Road. The two ran the rest of the way concurrently to [[Cadillac Square]]. There they terminated at a common point with [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]] (Woodward Avenue) and [[U.S. Route 112|US&nbsp;112]] (Michigan Avenue).

King Darius ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Archibald Asparagus|Archibald Asparagus]]) is in his court with his Wisemen ([[List of VeggieTales characters#The Scallions|The Scallions]]) when he confides that he has had a nightmare and wants help with what it means. The Wisemen cannot figure out the answer, but Daniel (Larry the Cucumber) arrives and correctly interprets the dream. Impressed, Darius then promotes Daniel as his second-in-command. However, the Wisemen become envious and trick Darius into creating a law that says his subjects can only pray to him. Soon after, the Wisemen catch Daniel praying to God and throw him into the Lions' Den in accordance with the law. Daniel hears the growling lions and is afraid, but an angel comforts him reminding him that God is with him. Meanwhile, the Wisemen celebrate their supposed victory and Darius spends a restless night praying that Daniel's God is protecting him. The next day, Darius runs to the Lions' Den and finds Daniel alive and well. Darius changes the law so that everybody must pray only to Daniel's God and turns to punish the scheming Wisemen, who subsequently quit their jobs and flee.

Junior is then rescued by his dad (Dad Asparagus) who explains to The Grapes that it is not nice to pick on people and Junior forgives them at his dad's urging. But when Dad says \"Junior,\" Tom and Rosie make fun of the name. Junior is reluctant to forgive them again, so Bob and Larry try to figure out how many times one should forgive and [[List of VeggieTales characters#Qwerty|Qwerty]] shows the verse, [[Matthew 18]]:22 \"Jesus answered 'I tell you not seven times, but seventy times seven.' {{Bibleref2c|Mt.|18:21-22}}.

In this story, Larry ([[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]]) daydreams, causing a ship filled with passengers to crash on a deserted island.

However, Bob ([[The Skipper]]) realizes the error of their ways and the group forgives Larry for stranding them.

Junior Asparagus lives in Jibber-de-Lot where everyone wears pots on their heads. For days, the two cities have flung headgear at each other over a disagreement on whose is best. Upon leaving, Larry is attacked by bandits (The Scallions) who rob and bury him in the ground. Both the mayor of Flibber-o-loo (Archibald Asparagus) and a Flibbian doctor (Archibald's wife) come upon Larry, but claim to be too busy to help. Soon after, Junior comes along and helps Larry out of the ground, despite the differences of their people. After seeing the kind act of a supposed enemy, the mayor concludes that everyone should help each other, no matter how different they are. The disagreement ends and the two cities instead throw candy and flowers at each other.\n\nIn the second story, Junior Asparagus  tells Dad Asparagus that he is not going to invite a new kid, Fernando, to his birthday party because he thinks that this boy is weird. Bob and Larry arrive in their small space ship and take Junior to the Starship Applepies, having discovered the ship is in the path of a giant meteor. Upon arriving, they discover that the power to the ship is out. While [[List of VeggieTales characters#Scooter|Scooter Carrot]], the ship's engineer, frantically works to fix the ship's engines, Junior suggests that two new crew members [[List of VeggieTales characters#Jimmy and Jerry Gourd|Jimmy and Jerry Gourd]] can help save the ship when Scooter tells him that the meteor is made of popcorn. Rocketed into space, Jimmy and Jerry eat the meteor before it can collide with the ship. Junior celebrates with the crew before being taken home by Bob and Larry, where he tells his Dad that he has reconsidered and will invite Fernando to his party despite how different he is. Bob and Larry then come back looking for the freeway, to which Junior gives them directions.\n\nSilly Song: \"The Hairbrush Song\"\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = Rack, Shack and Benny\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1995|11|28}}\n| ShortSummary    = It covers peer pressure and encourages viewers to stand up for their beliefs.\n\nThe story is an adaption of the biblical story of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] told by [[List of VeggieTales characters#The Green Onions|Grandpa George]] and takes place at the Nezzer Chocolate Factory where the employees work hard all day making chocolate bunnies on an assembly line. In celebration of selling their two-millionth chocolate bunny, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Mr. Nezzer|Mr. Nezzer]] announces that for 30 minutes all employees may eat all the bunnies they want. While all other workers ravenously devour the chocolate, Shack (Junior Asparagus) convinces his friends Rack (Bob the Tomato) and Benny (Larry the Cucumber) to abstain, reminding them that their parents taught them that too much candy is not healthy. He emphasizes his stance by singing a lullaby called \"Think of Me\" that his mom taught him.\n\nWhen Mr. Nezzer leaves his office to discover all the workers sick except for Rack, Shack, and Benny, the three are rewarded and promoted to Junior Executives. The following day, Mr. Nezzer calls the trio into his office and informs them that he has constructed a 90-foot high bunny which he intends to force all employees to sing the \"Bunny Song\" and bow down to. To whomever sings the song, nothing in the world (such as God, church, school, healthy food, and family) is more important than the bunny. Those who object to the song will be deemed \"bad bunnies\", thrown into the factory's furnace, and burned to death.\n\nLater, at the statue's dedication ceremony, Mr. Nezzer commands all of his workers to bow and sing The Bunny Song. However, Mr. Lunt notices that the trio are not bowing or singing. Mr. Nezzer confronts the trio, and with mounting frustration, orders them to sing. Eventually, the trio respond by instead singing \"Think of Me\" to protest. Mr. Nezzer is touched, but still orders their incineration, telling the guards to take them to the furnace. Meanwhile, [[List of VeggieTales characters#The C|Laura Carrot]] plans their rescue. After Mr. Nezzer sends the trio down the garbage chute to the furnace, Laura rushes in and rescues them with her delivery truck. After attempting, but failing, to flee through the factory's ventilation system, a pair of mechanical arms, operated by Mr. Lunt, grab the truck to dump the trio into the furnace. As Mr. Nezzer gloats at the three finally falling in, Mr. Lunt sees four people (the trio and a shiny person) inside, none of whom are being incinerated. Shocked, Mr. Nezzer tells the trio to come out and they emerge from the furnace unscathed. Mr. Nezzer realizes that it was God who saved the trio and, feeling guilty for his actions, apologizes to them, and the trio forgive him.\n\nSilly Song: \"The Dance of the Cucumber\"\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Dave and the Giant Pickle\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1996|4|2}}\n| ShortSummary    = The story begins in the desert near Jerusalem where Little Dave (Junior Asparagus) and his three older brothers (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd and Tom Grape) are tending a flock of sheep.

Eventually, their father, Jesse (Pa Grape), comes with the news that the Philistines ([[List of VeggieTales characters#The French Peas|The French Peas]]) are attacking and that King Saul (Archibald Asparagus) is gathering an army to face the threat. Jimmy, Jerry, Tom, and Dave run to volunteer, but Dave is stopped by Jesse who tells him that \"big people do big things and little people do little things,\" forcing him to stay and tend the sheep alone. Dave then starts to wonder why little people cannot do big things.\n\nAt King Saul's camp, the Israelites and the Philistines reach a compromise to end the war quickly: They will have their two greatest fighters face off with the champion determining who shall win the war. Because the Philistines are small King Saul agrees, but he soon regrets this when the Philistines bring out the 30-foot tall [[Goliath]] ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Goliath|a giant pickle]]). This causes the Israelites to run away and hide. No one is willing to fight Goliath and the Israelites stall for forty days. One day, Dave is sent to the camp to deliver food to his brothers and is ashamed at the sight of the Israelites hiding from the Philistines. Jimmy and Jerry warn Dave about Goliath, but Dave tells King Saul that he will fight. King Saul is shocked and a little scared at first, but after Dave gives him some examples on how God can help kids make a difference, King Saul is impressed and grants Dave his request. Dave then goes into battle armed with nothing but stones and a sling, while Goliath dons a pair of boxing gloves. However, the battle is short as Dave slings one of the stones at Goliath and strikes him between the eyes, knocking him out. The Philistines panic and run away, while the Israelites congratulate Dave for his victory and his faith.\n\nSilly Song: \"I Love My Lips\"\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = The Toy That Saved Christmas\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1996|10|22}}\n| ShortSummary    = [[List of VeggieTales characters#The Green Onions|Grandpa George]] (In a role similar to S.D. Kluger from ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]'') tells a bedtime story to his granddaughter [[List of VeggieTales characters#The Green Onions|Annie]]. In the story, Mr. Nezzer is the owner of a toy company who, via television commercial, is spreading the word of his newest toyline, \"Buzz-Saw Louie,\" with a working buzz saw built into his right arm and a trigger in his nose that makes him tell kids to get more toys (though due to the collapse of a bridge, delivery isn't available in Puggslyville). After seeing the commercial, the kids of Dinkletown (the town George claims he used to deliver mail to) begin begging their parents for more toys. As Buzz-Saw Louie dolls roll off the production line, one of them inexplicably comes to life and escapes the factory to search for the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Larry, Bob, and Junior go sledding and crash into a fence. They happen upon the escaped Louie and offer to help him on his quest. They see Grandpa George, who reads the [[Nativity of Jesus]] from [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and explains that the true meaning of Christmas is to give, not get. The Veggies and Louie are heartened by the news and are left wondering how to tell the rest of the people about the true meaning of Christmas before Christmas Day, and sneak into Mr. Nezzer's TV studio. Upon beginning to broadcast their message, Mr. Nezzer discovers them and they are captured. While threatening to send them away tied up in a sled, Mr. Nezzer is interrupted by the families of Dinkletown, who intervene. Upon receiving a teddy bear for a gift, Mr. Nezzer repents, though inadvertently sends the sled with the group down through the restricted Puggslyville tube. Panicking, he and several of his penguin workers get on their own sleds and give chase in an attempt to save them. Louie is able to divert the sled's course, but upon leaving Mr. Nezzer alone cruising toward the broken bridge, he races with the penguins to save him just as he is about to fall down the ravine. The story concludes with everybody in Dinkletown, including Mr. Nezzer, getting together to celebrate a Christmas party, as well as Louie starting a business to make use of his saw.\n\nSilly Song: \"Oh, Santa!\"\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = Very Silly Songs!\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1997|2|4}} \n| ShortSummary    = The episode begins on the countertop as Larry welcomes the viewers to what he thinks is the first \"VeggieTales Workout Video.\" He starts exercising, and then proceeds to the trampoline and jumps gradually until he's high enough he starts hitting a cupboard directly above him.

Jimmy and Jerry Gourd, who staff an early-warning radar station at the Bumblyburg Science Lab, alert [[Larry the Cucumber|Larry-Boy]] of an approaching alien. Larry-Boy begins to search for the alien but has no success. Upon landing, the comet turns out to be a blue tennis ball-sized alien named \"Fibrillus Minimus\" (Fib, for short).  Meanwhile, Junior Asparagus and Laura Carrot are having a tea party at Junior's house, where Junior accidentally breaks his father's prized \"[[List of VeggieTales characters#Art Bigoti|Art Bigoti]]\" bowling plate. Soon afterwards, Fib emerges and convinces Junior to be dishonest to his father claiming, \"A little fib couldn't hurt anybody.\" Junior lies to his father and claims that Laura broke the plate by using an apple chopper. Junior's dad believes him, but Junior soon discovers that his \"little fib\" grows larger every time he lies. Despite this, he tells Percy that Laura's brother Lenny fed the plate to his pet crocodile, which; like Junior's father, he believes.\n\nLater that night, Laura, Percy, and Lenny form an angry mob and confront Junior about his lies. When he tells a lie about cows coming to Earth and destroying the plate, which Percy likens to a movie he & his brother saw at the beginning of the show. Pretty soon, Fib grows to be a Godzilla-sized monster who holds Junior prisoner and starts wreaking havoc in the city.\n\nLarry-Boy is summoned and forced to pursue the Fib and Junior in his Larry-Mobile as it tries to escape by climbing to the top of the water tower. Larry-Boy transforms the Larry-Mobile into the Larry-Plane and flies into the sky but ejects after finding out the Larry-Plane is unarmed, causing him to be caught by the Fib. He is grabbed and squeezed until one of his plungers pops out and is about to be eaten when his butler, Alfred (Archibald Asparagus), informs him that Junior is the only one who can stop the Fib.

The Israelites, having been held as slaves in Egypt, are liberated by [[Moses]] (Mr. Nezzer) and led to the [[Promised Land]]. However, they flee upon seeing Goliath's family in the land and are banished from the Promised Land for forty years. Upon the completion of their forty-year exile, Moses is dead, which means that Joshua (Larry the Cucumber) has become leader of the Israelites. Joshua begins leading them back to the Promised Land, but they soon stumble upon one big obstacle that prevents them from going any further: the city of Jericho. The Israelites are soon met by the defenders of Jericho (the French Peas) who taunt them from atop the city's great walls. Joshua tries to explain that God has given the land to the Israelites and that therefore the defenders will have to step aside, but the Israelites are instead met by more insults and smug jeering. When Philippe drops a [[Slush (beverage)|slushy]] off the wall, which hits Jimmy on the head, the Israelites decide to camp out for the night.\n\nThat night, the Israelites argue about what to do. Pa Grape wants to detour to Egypt, and Jimmy and Jerry are convinced they need firepower to attack the wall, so they begin constructing a giant rocket. Meanwhile, Joshua meets the commander of the Army of the Lord (Archibald Asparagus), who tells him how the Israelites are to take Jericho: they must march around the city once a day for six days; on the seventh day they are to march around it seven times while the priests blow their horns, and all yell as loud as they can at the same time. At this point, the messenger states, the walls of Jericho will fall. Joshua is fascinated by this idea. The next morning, Joshua reports the plan to the Israelites, but they are unsure if it will work. Meanwhile, Jimmy and Jerry have finished constructing their rocket. Eventually, Joshua talks them into trying it God's way and leads them back to Jericho later that day.\n\nWhile marching around the walls, the Israelites face more trouble; the city's defenders insult them all the more while Joshua and the agitated Israelites try to ignore them and focus on their mission. Unfortunately, the taunting soon turns into a semi-frozen battle when the Jericho defenders unleash an attack on the Israelites by pelting them with slushies, forcing them to retreat. The end of the day finds the drenched and desperate Israelites on the verge of rebellion, while Joshua refuses to quit. At this point, Junior intervenes and convinces them to continue with the plan, saying that God's way always works out in the end.\n\nInspired by Junior's speech, the Israelites agree to stick with the plan, despite more slushy attacks and taunts. On the seventh day, they blow their horns and yell. At first, nothing happens. The Jericho peas laugh, but then the walls collapse. The Israelites begin finishing their journey to the Promised Land as the Jericho defenders run away in panic.\n\nSilly Song: \"The Song of the [[Zebu|Ceb\u00fa]]\"\n\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Madame Blueberry\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1998|7|21}}\n| ShortSummary    = The story features a story about being grateful with what God gives you.\n\nIn a takeoff of the story of [[Madame Bovary]], [[List of VeggieTales characters#Madame Blueberry|Madame Blueberry]] is rich and lives in a sparsely-decorated tree house. Though her butlers (Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber) attend to her every whim, they find themselves unable to lift her spirits. The only happiness she seems to have comes from photographs of her neighbor's possessions. One day, a trio of salesmen ([[List of VeggieTales Characters#The Scallions|the Scallions]]) arrive at Blueberry's tree house to promote a new local mega-store, the Stuff-Mart, saying the store has everything she needs to be happy. Though Bob has his doubts, Blueberry eagerly follows the three salesmen to the store.\n\nAlong the way, she sees Annie happily celebrating her birthday with her parents, though all she has to celebrate with is a piece of apple pie. She wonders why Annie is so happy with so little, but forgets about it upon entering the store. Blueberry goes on a buying spree and has it all delivered to her tree house. During a lunch break, Blueberry sees Junior Asparagus's excitement over a new ball his dad bought for him in spite of his disappointment that his dad could not afford the train set he really wanted. Blueberry again wonders how someone can be happy with so little while she is not happy despite having everything she wants. Blueberry finally is thankful for what she has.\n\nThe ongoing deliveries make the tree house begin to fall backwards, which startles Blueberry and her butlers. They (with the exception of Larry, who is in a carrying basket) take carts and attempt to race to the house and stop the deliveries in time. They manage to make it in time to see the treehouse still tilted from the weight of the deliveries until it becomes stable. Just then, a butterfly lands on the weather vane of the treehouse, which causes the back door to open and dump Blueberry's possessions everywhere in her tree house into the lake below. The house quickly loses weight and is flung into the air by the tree, after which it collapses in the parking lot of the Stuff-Mart. Blueberry is comforted by the presence of her butlers, Annie, Junior, and their parents, and trusts that everything will turn out right in the end.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with \"Love Songs with Mr. Lunt\" (\"His Cheeseburger\")\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = The End of Silliness?\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1998|11|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = In a fit of indignation, Archibald Asparagus has cancelled \"Silly Songs with Larry,\" the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song.

Percy refuses, but the Scallion then demands the money he is carrying for milk money. After stealing the money and escaping to the rooftops with his loot, Larry-Boy confronts him and shakes the stolen money off of him before throwing him into Officer Scooter's patrol car. Soon after, he begins reviewing his capture technique with his butler, Alfred (Archibald Asparagus), but in the process accidentally knocks an unfinished potted plant off the ledge. The plant gets caught on some power lines on the way down, where a woman is gossiping on the phone, then falls into a sewer drain where the gossip brings the plant to life (in the style of the [[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]' Audrey II).\n\nThe next morning, Alfred is speaking at a school and tells the teacher (Dad Asparagus) he needs to go home and \"recharge his batteries\" (meaning he needs to rest). Junior Asparagus and Laura Carrot take the [[figure of speech]] literally and jump to the false conclusion that Alfred is a robot. As they walk home, discussing what they heard Alfred say, a small talking weed pipes up wanting to hear more, and they talk to it under the impression the information will be [[Secrecy|kept secret]]. Soon, similar weeds begin to appear throughout town, spreading the rumor. Larry and Alfred are tending to a garden when Alfred heads inside to answer the phone. Another weed appears and tries to spread the rumor, but Larry does not listen. Alfred then calls Larry in.

Junior and Laura decide that the way to save Alfred is to spread ''good'' words about him. They convince the citizens that Alfred is not a robot.

A search is then initiated to find a new Queen.\n\nLater that morning, [[Esther]] and her cousin [[Mordecai]] (Pa Grape) are discussing her friend who stole an apple. Esther lacks the courage to confront her, but Mordecai believes she shouldn't be afraid to do what is right. When Haman drives up in a faux-car to collect the eligible maidens, he spots Mordecai and orders him to bow in his presence, but Mordecai refuses as he bows down to no one except God and Xerxes. Haman then spots Esther and has her taken to the palace with the other maidens (though the relationship between Mordecai and Esther is kept secret).\n\nAt the palace, Xerxes and Haman audition the maidens to be the new Queen. When Esther takes the stage and sings, Xerxes is left in awe and the decision is made. However, Esther does not wish to be the Queen, but regardless she is crowned and ensconced in her new life against her will. One day in the throne room of the palace, Xerxes is visited by the Peaoni brothers (the French Peas), who plan to crush him with a grand piano while distracting him with a cake. Mordecai, who is hiding in a corner to avoid Haman, observes the plot and informs Esther. Esther warns Xerxes in time and the piano crashes harmlessly onto the cake. Xerxes thanks her for saving his life, but she indicates Mordecai, saying that the credit should be his.\n\nHaman banishes the Peaoni Brothers to the Island of Perpetual Tickling for their crimes of attempting to crush Xerxes and for entering the throne room uninvited. Though Xerxes believes he is safe, Haman convinces him that a greater threat awaits, which is a family that cannot be trusted. Unaware that Haman is talking about Mordecai, Xerxes unwittingly authorizes an edict to have him and his family banished to the Island of Perpetual Tickling. Mordecai finds the edict posted in the town and visits Esther on her balcony at the palace. He appeals to her to reveal Haman's evil plans to Xerxes, but she is afraid as she lacks the courage to confront Xerxes and struggles with what to do.\n\nWhile Mordecai reminds her that she need not fear to do what's right, action does not come easy for Esther. Twice, she attempts to inform Xerxes, and both times she fails, lamely inviting Xerxes and Haman to dinner instead. Meanwhile, Haman attempts to get Mordecai to bow to him again and threatens to have his banishment carried out immediately when he refuses. His attempt is foiled when Xerxes utterly humiliates him by declaring his plan to throw a parade in Mordecai's honor for saving his life. On her third attempt, Esther is finally able to muster up the courage to face Xerxes, and in the process unveils Haman's scheme, forcing Xerxes to banish him to the Island of Perpetual Tickling. Mordecai ends up filling Haman's former position as Xerxes' right-hand-man as Esther, having saved her people, gazes out the side of the palace with a smile.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 15\n| Title           = Lyle the Kindly Viking\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|3|24}}<ref>{{cite web|title=VeggieTales: Lyle the Kindly Viking Advertisement|url=https://imgur.com/tcl5XCS|website=Imgur.com (original document published by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]])|accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Omelet ([[Jimmy Gourd]]) is a prince of a kingdom in [[Denmark]] who desires some eggs \"cooked light and fluffy\" to eat.

One day, Lyle's trips are discovered by fellow Vikings Otar and Sven (Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber), who confront him and promise to keep it secret. Lyle convinces them that sharing is a much nicer alternative to pillaging and plundering. A few days later, Lyle is discovered by the Viking leader Olaf (Mr. Nezzer), who does not approve and wants to make an example of him. When a storm capsizes the Viking ships, the monks rescue Lyle and Lyle who convince the monks to save the rest of the doomed Vikings.

Cavis Appythart (Bob the Tomato) and Millward Phelps (Larry the Cucumber) are jingle writers who decide to make their big break into [[musical theatre]].  While Millward is content to see their work featured on billboards and in newspapers, Cavis believes they can make a difference in crime-ridden London by staging a grand musical that will move the citizens to greater expressions of love. Their opportunity arises when Millward's Uncle Ebenezer Nezzer grants them the use of his theater on Christmas Eve. They plan the huge production of a new musical called \"The Princess and the Plumber\". However, with only three days left until Christmas Eve, they still need a script. Seymour Schwenk (Sullivan's and Gilbert's middle names) (Pa Grape), their friend and an inventor, shows up in an experimental rocket car (a direct reference to ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'') and delivers a box of light bulbs to them. Cavis maintains that if their production is glitzy and bright (electric lights are still a novelty at this time and were first introduced at the [[Savoy Theatre]] for Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'') then their show will be a bigger hit and reach more people. He plans to integrate the lights directly into the scenery itself.\n\nCavis and Millward also need to convince the city's premiere talent, Constance Effie Pickering (Madame Blueberry), to star in the lead role, and they need to get a commitment from Prince Calvin Fredrick (Mr. Lunt) to attend the premiere. While Cavis and his assistant Bob Winston (Jean-Claude Pea) work on Pickering and the Prince, Millward works to complete the script. Everything eventually starts coming together, and Cavis starts feeling confident that their production will be a huge success. After noticing a flyer for a Christmas pageant planned to occur on the same night at a local church, Cavis goes to investigate. He observes Edmund Gilbert (Junior Asparagus) preparing a low-budget children's play, and concludes that it poses no threat to their production. However, the pageant intends to feature an object called the \"Star of Christmas\". Wondering aloud about this as he leaves the church, Cavis is overheard by Arthur McHollingshead (Archibald Asparagus), a historian who reveals that the Star of Christmas is an ancient relic that has not been publicly displayed for 79 years. He rushes off with great excitement to report the news, which promptly makes the front-page headlines the next morning.\n\nFaced with the prospect of losing their audience, and in particular the Prince, to the church pageant, Cavis and Millward wish to make their own production greater and flashier, and in desperation sneak into the church to steal the Star. They are caught, however, and narrowly escape from the aged \"Moyer the Destroyer\" (Scooter Carrot) who was left to guard the relic.  With the Star and the flashy lights, Cavis is certain that \"The Princess and the Plumber\" is now a guaranteed success. But during dress rehearsal, the excessive number of lights, which Seymour had warned were a fire hazard, ignite the curtains.  The theater goes up in flames, taking with it the Star of Christmas.  As Cavis and Millward mope over this terrible turn of events, police officer Dwiglight Howarde (Jerry Gourd) arrives with Moyer to arrest them for stealing the Star. In the jail, they meet a prisoner, Charles Pincher, who laughs at their efforts to spread love by means of an elaborate stage production.  He claims that real love makes sacrifices to help others without expecting anything in return and is extremely rare.\n\nAs if on cue, Edmund and his father, Reverend Gilbert (Dad Asparagus), arrive at the jail to release Cavis and Millward, having chosen out of love not to press charges for the theft of the Star.  Cavis is moved, and he expresses his desire to attend the pageant. However, the pageant is scheduled to start in ten minutes and there is not enough time to walk there. Just then, Seymour arrives in his rocket car. He entrusts Millward to drive the vehicle and try to get them all to the church on time. After a harrowing ride fraught with collisions and near-misses, Cavis, Millward, Edmund, and Reverend Gilbert arrive at the church just as the pageant is about to start.\n\nThe pageant is a success, with Prince Calvin and Miss Pickering in attendance. Cavis finally learns that Christmas is not about glitz and grand productions, but about a baby in a manger, Jesus, who is the real \"Star of Christmas\". After the pageant, Ebenezer chews out Cavis and Millward in regards to the theater and suggests they work in his factory to pay it off (setting the stage for the events of ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#An Easter Carol (2004)|An Easter Carol]]''), after which Moyer shows them that the real Star of Christmas (the object) is safe and that the duo stole the Turtle of Damascus, which he claims most experts consider to be a hoax. The episode ends with Cavis and Millward performing a selfless act at last: they bring cookies and a gift to Charles Pincher in his jail cell, and Cavis says, smiling warmly, \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Pincher.\"\n\nAwards: The episode was nominated for [[Annie Award for Best Animated Home Entertainment Production|Best Animated Home Entertainment Production]] in the [[30th Annie Awards]], but lost to ''[[Rolie Polie Olie: The Great Defender of Fun]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annie Awards|url=https://annieawards.org/legacy/30th-annie-awards|accessdate=January 7, 2018|website=annieawards.org|date=February 1, 2003}}</ref>\n\n''Note'': The episode was originally going to be released in July 30, 2002, but it was rescheduled back to October 29, 2002.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| Title           = The Wonderful World of Auto-tainment!\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2003|5|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = After Larry and Bob briefly argue over the theme song, a door opens up and they come out of it. Throughout the beginning, Larry slowly reveals the \"Wonderful World of Auto-Tainment\" to Bob. The Ventrilomatic and Rusty (from the ''[[3-2-1 Penguins!]]'' series) play a role in this episode as the adjudicators, as does Mr. Lunt (as the \"Techno-Gourd of the future\"), who runs the machine, which consists of the Wheel of Veggies, which spins most of the ''VeggieTales'' cast as if on a roulette, and the Swarming Balls of Disorder, which determine both the topic and genre of the song. Whoever is randomly selected by the wheel will be kicked off the machine and into a performance room, being forced to sing a song in the process. The French Peas (Phillipe and Jean-Claude), Pa Grape, Archibald Asparagus, and Junior Asparagus are forced to sing songs.\n\nThe French Pea duo starts off the show by singing the [[cumulative song]] \"There's a hole in bottom of the sea\" with a slide show. Pa Grape is second, singing \"[[Zacchaeus (song)|Zacchaeus Was a Wee Little Man]].\"\n\nThe show takes a break as animated parable \"Lunch\" is shown. A blue man named Ed (accompanied by his green dog, Mozart) tries to buy a treat from a vending machine, but the serve (\"Yummy\") button does not work. Frustrated, he tries to smack the button enough so it will work, but the machine falls on him. With barely enough strength, he lifts the machine, trying to get it back in its former position, when his treat slips out of the deposit area. He tries to get it, but is crushed again by the machine. He manages to lift it until it is on its other side. He gets the treat and is just about to eat it when a bird poops on it. Ed mopes over the loss of his treat as the parable cuts off with a \"the end\" text screen.\n\nThe show resumes with Archibald Asparagus singing [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s \"[[I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General]].\" Rusty begins to lash out at Ventril-o-Matic. At the last second, Larry steps into the performance room, and sings \"[[You Are My Sunshine]],\" with Junior Asparagus and a flower chorus. Rusty is in bliss and requests to watch an aardvark sing. After Binky the Opera Singer walks off the stage frustrated no one has clapped for him, Pa Grape is once again selected on the wheel and sings the [[Folk music|folk song]] ''[[Low Bridge (song)|Low Bridge, Everybody Down]]''. Bob expresses his hatred of the future as Rusty begins experiencing mood swings. Junior closes the show by singing a song about going to bed, praying and telling God about his day, and talking to God about how, according to the Bible, he loves him. He also tells God about screwing up (not sharing toys, coloring on the wall, making noise, etc.). After the song, Bob and Larry announce their departure from the future by saying that they are ready to go home, so they say goodbye and travel back to the present time, with Mr. Lunt catching up to them at the last second claiming to be disturbed by Rusty and Ventril-o-Matic and wanting to go back to the present.\n\nSilly Song: None\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 19\n| Title           = The Ballad of Little Joe\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2003|8|5}}\n| ShortSummary    = As the story begins in the American Wild West in the year 1889, we are introduced to the brothers (the French Peas) and Little Joe (Larry the Cucumber) (an allusion to [[Bonanza#Michael Landon - Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright|\"Little Joe\" Cartwright]]) who all live at the \"Okie-Dokie Corral\". Among Joe's unique skills are the abilities to solve problems, organize resources, and interpret dreams. We soon learn that it is Little Joe's birthday, and the brothers' father (Pa Grape) lavishes attention and gifts upon him.\n\nWhen Joe foretells a time when his brothers will bow down before him, their jealousy turns to spite, and they decide to sell him into slavery to the Scallions. He travels on a zig-zag path and ends up in Dodgeball City in the year 1890, where he starts working at a saloon for Mr. McPotipher (Scooter Carrot), and his unique skills quickly make him an invaluable employee. Also working at the saloon is Miss Kitty (Madame Blueberry), who entertains the patrons from the stage. She also becomes jealous of Joe when he is named Employee of the Month in her place. She frames him and he is imprisoned for the theft of gold, a crime he did not commit.\n\nJoe keeps a positive attitude in jail and is able to help two inmates (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd), who have been haunted by dreams. His predictions come true: Jimmy is released and Jerry, presumably, is executed. When his reputation comes to the attention of the Mayor (Mr. Nezzer), Joe is summoned to interpret a particularly disturbing dream of the latter, in which seven fat cows are devoured by seven scrawny cows. Joe understands immediately and warns the Mayor: there will be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine from 1890 to 1897; fill the storehouses now so you will be prepared.\n\nJoe is put in charge of distributing the grain during the years of famine. When he recognizes his own family has come to procure food, he is overcome with emotion. He wants to reveal himself to them, but first needs to know if they have changed. He devises a plan where he frames the youngest brother, Benjamin (Junior Asparagus), for theft to see how they respond. When all the brothers insist on taking the fall in his place and rue the previous loss of another brother, Joe reveals his identity. Jude (Jean-Claude Pea) apologizes to Joe for what he has done to him, who explains that God used the wrong he did to turn it into good, and forgives his brothers. The story concludes with the happy reunion.\n\nSilly Song: \"Belly Button\" with Boyz in the Sink\n\nAwards: \"Belly Button\" won a [[Chicago Film Festival]] Award for Best Animated Short and was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Best Animated Short. \"Belly Button\" was also nominated for a [[GMA Dove Award]] for Best Music Video of the year in 2004.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 20\n| Title           = An Easter Carol\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|2|10}}\n| ShortSummary    = It is the day before Easter, and the local church is scheduled to have a new window unveiling service at the next day's morning service. Ebenezer Nezzer, who owns a local factory, used to attend church with his grandma when he was little, but no longer goes. Reverend Gilbert (Dad Asparagus) and his son Edmund (Junior Asparagus) agree to pay Ebenezer a visit and invite him to the Easter service. Cavis Appythart (Bob the Tomato) and Ebenezer's nephew, Millward Phelps (Larry the Cucumber), are working in Ebenezer's factory to repay him after burning down his theater more than a year prior in ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#The Star of Christmas (2002)|The Star of Christmas]]''. Cavis and Millward disagree over who should approach Ebenezer and ask for a day off for Easter. When the duo ask, Ebenezer lectures them about the history of how his grandmother started making Easter eggs. Ebenezer recalls that before his grandma died, she told him to tell everyone \"Easter means no death.\" He misunderstands this, thinking that as long as he makes Easter eggs he will keep his grandma alive forever. When Reverend Gilbert and Edmund arrive, Ebenezer explains that he plans to tear down the church and build an Easterland theme park in its place. When the four protest, Ebenezer becomes furious and kicks them out of the factory, firing Cavis and Millward in the process. The townsfolk soon learn about the news and are worried about the demolition of the church, but cannot stop Nezzer since he owns the property on which the church is located.\n\nThat night, while Ebenezer is asleep, he sees a vision of his grandma telling him he has missed the point of Easter, and at the stroke of midnight, he will receive a second visitor to help him understand. Meanwhile, Cavis and Millward attempt, but fail, to break into the factory to steal the Easterland plans. Mr. Nezzer then wakes up from his vision and then intends to stay awake for the visitor. He falls asleep waiting for the visitor, and at the stroke of midnight, a clockwork egg suddenly opens and an angel named [[Hope]] emerges. She wakes Ebenezer and starts showing him Easter Past, beginning with a church service. A young Ebenezer and his grandma are in attendance, and Grandma Nezzer is trying to get Ebenezer to understand the story of Easter but the young Ebenezer is mainly focused on selling his eggs and wondering why the egg he received is empty. Next, Hope shows Ebenezer Easter from a year ago, when Ebenezer first started making plastic Easter eggs. He talks to an inventor named Seymour (Pa Grape) and gets Seymour to agree to invent plastic chickens that can make plastic eggs. Seymour is not paid, but Ebenezer does give him an early free pass to Easterland much to Hope's dismay.\n\nHope and Ebenezer return to Easter Present and visit the Reverend's house, where he and Moyer (Scooter Carrot) are discussing about the church. It is revealed that Grandma Nezzer paid for all of the church windows herself, and that just before she died she commissioned the new window that they were going to unveil on Easter morning. Ebenezer remains adamant that remaining loyal to his grandma's business and Easterland is the only way to maintain her memory. Hope and Ebenezer then learn that Edmund is sick and will die within a year if nothing changes. Ebenezer is shocked and does not understand why Edmund's parents are so calm with such news. Hope then takes Ebenezer back into the church and teaches him the story of Jesus' life, his Crucifixion, and eventually his Resurrection. With a deeper understanding of Easter's eternal significance, Ebenezer finally accepts his grandmother's passing.\n\nHope then welcomes Nezzer to Easter Future. The church is being demolished, the orphanage is gone, Little Edmund has died, and the town's once-brave policeman (Jerry Gourd) has lost the courage to stop criminals. Hope disappears back into the egg and Ebenezer pleads for her to come back because they need her. He rushes back to the church to try to stop the demolition and wakes up. He finds out it is still Easter Present and that he has another chance. Ebenezer arrives at the church and stops the crew (the French Peas) just as demolition is about to start.\n \nMillward suddenly rushes in and shouts that the factory is about to explode and that Cavis is trapped inside. Ebenezer rushes back into the factory to save Cavis, and they escape by flinging themselves through one of the factory's windows by use of a machine just as the factory explodes. It starts raining Easter eggs across the town and Ebenezer promises to help fix up the orphanage and help young Edmund get the medicine he needs with the money he has left.\n\nGuest Star: [[Rebecca St. James]] as Hope\n\n\n\nFeatured Song: Hope's Song\n\n''Note'': The episode was originally going to be released in August 5, 2003, but it was rescheduled back to February 10, 2004.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 21\n| Title           = A Snoodle's Tale\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|18}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story, an English gentleman named Mr. Butterbun (Scooter Carrot) and his butler Poole (Larry the Cucumber) are obsessing about Mr. Sly, a flashy disco dancer who performs on the street at night. The neighbors, including Poole, seem to enjoy his performances, but Butterbun is deeply suspicious. When the dancer disappears into the home of Dr. Jiggle (Jimmy Gourd), he insists that they warn the doctor. Dr. Jiggle also admits to being impressed by the Mr. Sly's fantastic moves, and confesses a desire to be a dancer himself. Unfortunately for him, his portly stature makes this impossible with his jiggly belly being a target for ridicule. When Butterbun requests an audience with Mr. Sly, Dr. Jiggle becomes frantic and quickly shows his guests the doorstep.\n\nButterbun is determined to find out who Mr. Sly really is and why he keeps disappearing into Dr. Jiggle's house. He enlists Poole to set a trap for him, to detain him while he dances and remove his disguise; but this plan fails when Poole instead gets caught up in the dance. The following night, Jiggle faints, and Sly appears again. Butterbun discovers that Jiggle and Sly are the same gourd, and Jiggle confesses to take dance class. Butterbun tells Jiggle that's great and he did not need to hide in a disguise because he's special just the way [[God]] made him. Dr. Jiggle finds out that he can dance in his own way.\n\nIn \"A Snoodle's Tale,\" Bob narrates the story of a whimsical little creature known as a Snoodle. The Snoodles live in Snoodleburg, a town which features prominently a large clock tower in the center. Every fourth Tuesday, it spits out a new Snoodle which slides down a chute to join the Snoodle society. The viewers then witness the birth of one such creature named Snoodle Doo. He is born without any knowledge of his talents or abilities, but has on his back a backpack which contains paints, a paintbrush, and a [[kazoo]]. He also discovers he has wings. Attempting to figure out his purpose in life, he tries to utilize these gifts: first flying and then painting. But his attempts are met with ridicule by the older, more experienced Snoodles. Making matters worse, they paint him pictures of his failures and stuff them into his backpack. The weight of these pictures (and figuratively their ridicule) drag him down, making him feel worthless.\n\nHe decides to leave Snoodleburg and, observing the finches flying freely over Mt. Ginches, decides that he too will go there. After an arduous climb he eventually reaches the peak. There he meets a Stranger, the Creator of the Snoodles (which is a representation of God himself), who lives in a cave high above the clouds. The Stranger asks the Snoodle why he is so dejected, and the Snoodle explains that it is because he is no good at anything. The Stranger invites him in for tea and throws the hurtful pictures into the fire, assuring him that they look nothing like him. The Creator then draws him a new picture, one that shows him confident and proud, which encourages Snoodle Doo to not just fly, but to soar. Snoodle Doo's own picture, the one ridiculed by his elders, is then hung by the Stranger on his fridge. The story ends as the young Snoodle flies back to Snoodleburg and tells of his journey to the others.\n\nSilly Song: \"Sport Utility Vehicle\"\n\nNote: This is the first episode to be released after [[Classic Media]] brought [[VeggieTales]] and [[Big Idea Entertainment]].

While Mr. Lunt and Jerry give up on the seemingly impossible task, Larry perseveres and is rewarded for his eventual success.\n\nIn the second segment, Lutfi presents a story about the origin of [[St. Patrick's Day]]. The story tells about [[Maewyn Succat]], a young English boy who is kidnapped by pirates and sold as a slave in [[Ireland]]. His new life is miserable and he spends his days in constant prayer, even as those around him celebrate [[paganism]]. When God tells him it is time to leave, Succat runs away and returns to England by way of France. Back at home, Maewyn continues his scholarship and dreams that the people of Ireland are begging him to come back and teach them about [[Christianity]]. Succat grows up to become a [[bishop]], is rechristened \"[[Saint Patrick|Patrick]]\", and fulfills his destiny to return to Ireland.\n\nIn the third segment, the titular story parodies the [[The Karate Kid (franchise)|Karate Kid]] and [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky film series]], mainly [[Rocky III|the third Rocky movie]], as well as [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[operetta]] [[The Mikado]]. \"The Italian Scallion\" (Larry the Cucumber) is a [[sumo]] wrestler who has difficulty taking anything seriously. He succeeds in injuring his sparring partner Po-Ta-To as a result of his clowning around when Po slips on a banana peel and falls from the ring, injuring his back.\n\nHe is admonished for his joking by Mikey ([[Pa Grape]]), who accuses him of being weak, lacking ambition, and never completing what he starts when young Hadrian (Junior Asparagus) reminds him that he has not yet fixed his bike. Meanwhile, the Champion, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Apollo Gourd|Apollo Gourd]], is looking for an opponent now that Po has been injured. The prize is a new \"Tiger Bike\". Wanting the bike for Hadrian, Scallion accepts the challenge. Mikey agrees to become his trainer on the condition that Scallion does everything he says.\n\nScallion starts out well and trains hard, but when things get difficult, he quits. However, when Scallion sees Hadrian emulating him he realizes that he must set a good example and persevere. He returns to his training with relish and eventually is ready for his match with Apollo Gourd, though naturally no one gives him a chance. However, Scallion does surprisingly well in the match. He lasts longer in the ring than anyone ever has against Apollo. When they both tumble out of the ring at the same moment, the match is called a tie. Unfortunately, this means that Apollo remains the champion. In spite of this, Scallion is victorious for having persevered and even completes the repairs to Hadrian's bike.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with \u201cSchoolhouse Polka with Larry\u201d (\"School House Polka\")\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| Title           = Duke and the Great Pie War\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|3|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story takes place in Egypt, Miriam (Laura Carrot) wonders why people in the Egyptian village refuse to acknowledge that her new baby brother Moses is a boy.

However, he is terrible at jousting and enrolls in \"Ye Old Knight School\" for training. When he fails a jousting test, he receives a disapproving look from the arrogant \"Otis The Elevated\" (Mr. Lunt). While walking with his friend Lucas (Bob The Tomato) one day, he comes across the sweet Princess Petunia ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Petunia Rhubarb|Petunia Rhubarb]]). Petunia is a Rhubarbarian who has been exiled from her own land and has taken refuge with her poor mother-in-law, Nona (Madame Blueberry) who is Duke's cousin. Duke is smitten with the exiled princess, despite her being a foreigner who is hated by the people of Scone, due to her relatives fighting against them in the Great Pie War.\n\nNona reveals the history of the family to Duke, how Petunia was the wife of the prince of Scone, how Duke is related to both Petunia and Otis, and how Otis precipitated the Great Pie War after refusing to take care of his family. Nona then gives Duke half of a key to the vault of the family castle and says that Otis was given the other half of it. In order to have the key made whole and Petunia restored, Duke must challenge Otis to a joust. The next day the joust is set up and the audience arrives to watch. The contest involves multiple challenges, among them an obstacle course and a riddle from the Abbott of Costello (Scallion #1). The obstacle course is won by Otis and Duke solves the riddle.

However, after a chain of events, his archenemy, Professor Rattan (Mr. Lunt), ends up swiping the Golden Carrot Nose and saying, \"Finders keepers!\" At the children's museum, Minnesota complains about Rattan to his assistant, Martin (Bob the Tomato). Then, a Parkman from New York City (Scallion #1) arrives to inform Minnesota about a plot to steal Samson's (the Peach) hairbrush, which is believed to possess the great powers of Samson. Apparently, Canadians want to use the power of the hairbrush to take over both halves of Niagara Falls. Assuming that Samson's strength came from his long hair, Minnesota decides he wants to use the power of the brush to get revenge on Rattan. Martin tries to tell him that the trip won't be about getting even with Rattan but Cuke rejects Martin's idea in favor of his own.\n\nThe first stop in his search, is an ice cream shop in [[Malta]]. He seeks advice from an old friend, a former archaeologist named Julia (Petunia Rhubarb). She gives him an address where he can find out more. Shortly after he leaves, Rattan arrives seeking the same information. When Julia refuses, Rattan sets the freezer to melt causing strawberry ice cream to flood the entire shop. Minnesota returns to save Julia, and she informs Minnesota they need to go to [[Seville]].\n\nIn the Barbershop of Seville, they are welcomed by barbers Figaro and Leo, who tell Minnesota of the Catacombs where the hairbrush is secluded. They offer him a map, which Rattan immediately steals. However, they also inform Minnesota of a shortcut to the Catacombs. Minnesota finds the hairbrush, but is confronted by Rattan (who thinks that the reason the brush doesn't work for Cuke is because he has no hair), and the Parkman (who was working for Rattan the entire time) who have captured Julia. Minnesota offers him the brush for Julia's freedom. Martin calls and claims that the brush has no power, and that Samson's power came from God rather than the artifact. Minnesota and Julia escape the Catacombs but again run into Rattan and the Parkman. Figaro and Leo arrive with two [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mounties]] (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd) who attempt to arrest Rattan, but Minnesota shows compassion by convincing them to let him go.

Billboy talks about retiring and leaving the shire and uses a strange bean to produce a birthday cake. Returning to his home, he finds Randalf waiting in his living room. Randalf remarks on Billboy's impressive height, his fine clothing, and his luxuriously appointed home, knowing they have come from the bean, and warns his friend of using such things lightly. Billboy concedes that the bean has given him almost everything he could want. He then announces that he is leaving the shire due to dissatisfaction and bequeathing everything he owns, including the bean, to his nephew, Toto (Junior Asparagus).\n\nWaiting for Toto, Randalf relates that Billboy has departed and draws his attention to the bean. Toto is curious as to why he would want a bean and Randalf describes the origin of a magical bean that could produce clothing, consumables, and small kitchen appliances, and also change your appearance. After verifying the bean's authenticity from an inscription left after warming it in the fire, Toto is unsure about accepting such a gift and tries to pass it off to Randalf. However, Randalf explains that one cannot choose his gifts and must determine for himself how they should best be used.\n\nHe then suggests that Toto travel to the Elders of the Razzberry Forest for insight with some friends that he has already gathered to assist with the journey: the ranger, Ear-a-Corn (Larry the Cucumber); the elf, Leg-O-Lamb (Jimmy Gourd); the dwarf, Grumpy (Pa Grape); and Leg-O-Lamb's brother (Jerry Gourd) who had nothing better to do. They trek through the Mountains of Much Snowia and eventually reach the Razzberry Forest.  There, Randalf warns the others not to laugh because the elders have lost their sense of humor. The Elders welcome them and inform Randalf that they must travel to the Land of Woe. The others burst into laughter upon hearing the greetings and native tongue of the Elders, which involves blowing raspberries. This gets them sentenced to detention on a platform forever until an eagle \"saves\" them and they escape. Leaving the forest, they emerge near the entrance to the Land of Woe. After opening the door, they realize that Toto is the only one small enough to fit through and he proceeds alone. However, the remainder of the group soon learns that a group of sporks, minions of the evil Scaryman (Scallion #1), are after Toto in order to seize the bean for their master. The fellowship then goes in pursuit.\n\nIn the Land of Woe, Toto encounters a strange creature named Ahem (Mr. Lunt), who reveals that he was once a normal flobbit like Toto and the former owner of the bean. Ahem then agrees to accompany Toto into Woe as a guide. Meanwhile, the others charge through the Red Gate, only to be trapped by the Sporks. The \"Other Elf\" (Who resembles the [[Keebler]] elf) then bakes cookies in a tree and gives them to the Sporks who have not eaten anything for days and the fellowship journeys on. Toto and Ahem arrive in Woe to find a desperate people lacking the most basic necessities, such as food and water. Ahem wants Toto to leave them, to use the bean for his own creature comforts, but Toto recognizes that he can use it to help the people of Woe. The fellowship arrives just ahead of Scaryman, who steals the bean. However, Billboy suddenly reappears, recovering the bean and returning it to Toto. Toto throws the bean into the well, bringing water back to the Land of Woe and restoring it to its fertile and beautiful state.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with \u201cSilly Songs with Elves\u201d (\"My Baby Elf\")\n\nFeatured Music Video: \"It's About Love\" performed by [[Wynonna Judd]]\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| Title           = Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|11}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Screencapture of VeggieTales: Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler DVD in stores March 11|url=https://imgur.com/P2MtoD7 |website=Imgur.com (original document published by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]])|accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story, knight Don Quixote (Archibald Asparagus) dreams he is facing three Peas in a world made of cooking utensils and foods.

However, there is one concern about a mysterious web that has appeared around the statue of Obadiah Bumbly in the town square. While the townspeople fret and prepare for the celebration, LarryBoy is in the Larry-Mobile on his way back to the Larry-Cave, snacking on chocolate truffles. His butler, Alfred (Archibald Asparagus), reminds him that eating too much chocolate will make him sick and compromise his abilities as a superhero. Back at the cave, LarryBoy becomes sick and admits that he can't control his chocolate addiction. With help from Alfred, he begins an exercise regimen that aims to limit the chocolate in his diet.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious villain apple named the Bad Apple is formulating a plan to derail the city's celebration. Her strategy is to enslave everyone by their own personal temptations, allowing her to take over the city of Bumblyburg while everybody is incapacitated. She tasks her sidekick, Curly the Worm, with identifying the weaknesses of each of the city's most important citizens: Mayor Blueberry, Reporter Petunia, and LarryBoy, for she believes that eliminating these three will cripple the city's leadership, communication, and law enforcement.\n\nShe begins by paying a visit to Mayor Blueberry, whose weakness is vanity. Bad Apple preys on this weakness by convincing her that as a representative of Bumblyburg, it is her duty to look her best and spins a web (a trap) in which she claims there are countless beautiful things to improve the mayor's appearance. Her vanity validated, the Mayor steps into the trap. Next, she pays a visit to Petunia, whose weakness is playing video games. Petunia realizes her important role in keeping the city informed, but admits that she could use a break. Bad Apple spins another trap, this one containing a test version of the latest, unreleased video game system. Unable to resist the temptation, Petunia steps into the trap to play. Meanwhile, back at the Larry-Cave, Alfred has discovered that the mysterious webs have plagued Bumblyburg before. On an old, scratchy film reel, he learns that an apple named Ephraim Apply tried to ensnare the settlers of the new town with diversions at an establishment called Apply's Funhouse. The people succumbed and the town suffered until Obadiah Bumbly arrived in time to liberate the people and banish Ephraim Apply forever.\n\nThe Bad Apple pays a visit to LarryBoy, and, having learned of his weakness for chocolate, uses it to gain entrance to the Larry-Cave. Little by little, she dampens his resolve until he too falls into a trap designed specifically for him. With Larry indisposed in the \"Chocolate Room\", she easily breaks Alfred upon his return, ensnaring him by the television in front of his favorite cartoon. With Bumblyburg's leaders and heroes out of the way, the Bad Apple proceeds to the town square to fulfill her great-uncle Ephraim's destiny: opening up the new and improved \"Apply's Funhouse II\". She and Curly begin to lure the helpless citizens into the funhouse. At the Larry-Cave, Alfred and LarryBoy realize that they need each other's help to fight the temptation. Working together, they dissolve the webs of their traps, then quickly set out to rescue Mayor Blueberry and Petunia. They then all rush to the town square to fight temptation together. As LarryBoy fights the Bad Apple, the funhouse topples and nearly crushes a mother and her baby. LarryBoy saves them and all of Bumblyburg by flinging the funhouse, along with the Bad Apple and Curly, out of the square and out of the city.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with a music video for \"Rock On, LarryBoy\".\n\nAward: This episode also won a [[Parents' Choice Award]].\n\nNOTE: This is the first episode released on Blu-Ray.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| Title           = Gideon: Tuba Warrior\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|11|7}}\n| ShortSummary    = The first story is narrated by the Captain of The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything (Pa Grape), as he tells it through the eyes of his ancestor Great-Grandfather Simon, a reporter for the ''Bristol Snoop'', a tabloid-like newspaper.

They pray to God for food and the next day when Simon offers to go out and buy them food, the baker and milkman (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd) miraculously come in and offers the children milk and bread.\n\nThe story of Gideon is played featuring Larry the Cucumber in the title role. Beginning with a montage of floats, as a victory parade for conquering the Midianites, Gideon stops the parade to explain that the large amount of praise lavished on him was not his to take. He then tells the \"true\" account, in which he reluctantly chooses to defend his country against an undefeated army of over 30,000 excessively hairy pickles, the Midianites, after an angel (Pa Grape) appears to him. Initially, he doesn't want to, and says that he's not a warrior, that he's afraid of the dark and screams like a girl, to which the angel replies, \"He (the Almighty) chose you\", \"to say the truth I'm afraid of the dark too,\" and \"Put me in the dark and I scream like a girl too.\" Gideon then asks for the miracle of a wet fleece and dry ground, which when the sign is complete, asks for another sign that the fleece be dry and the ground around drenched.

Using his Stick, Moe makes it snow momentarily, but the snow soon melts leaving the mayor and his gang on the hot ground in the frying sun. Sally and her family run to Moe and the two are reunited.

Junior denies this as he goes upstairs, but when he imagines his family portrait is full of monsters, he runs to his room scared. Bob and Larry drop in and comfort Junior in song about how he does not need to be afraid because God is watching out for him and He is bigger than anything. Junior is then confronted by [[List of VeggieTales characters#Phil Winkelstein|Frankencelery]] who reveals that he is really just an actor named Phil Winkelstein from Toledo, Ohio, United States. Junior is then convinced and sings that \"God is bigger\" and after Bob, Larry, and Phil leave, Junior's dad comes to tuck Junior in. The pair then discuss how God takes care of them, that Junior needs to be more careful about what he watches in the future, and it's okay to tell his parents if he's scared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/pre2000/rvu-veg1.html|title=Veggie Tales: Where's God When I'm S-Scared?

Vischer also serves as the animator of this segment, along with Robert Ellis and Chris Olsen.\n\nThe second segment is the story of [[Daniel in the lions' den|''Daniel and the Lions' Den.'']] The setting is the Middle East in the year 1200 BC. King Darius ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Archibald Asparagus|Archibald Asparagus]]) is in his court with his Wisemen ([[List of VeggieTales characters#The Scallions|The Scallions]]) when he confides that he has had a nightmare and wants help with what it means. The Wisemen cannot figure out the answer, but Daniel (Larry the Cucumber) arrives and correctly interprets the dream. Impressed, Darius then promotes Daniel as his second-in-command. However, the Wisemen become envious and trick Darius into creating a law that says his subjects can only pray to him. Soon after, the Wisemen catch Daniel praying to God and throw him into the Lions' Den in accordance with the law. Daniel hears the growling lions and is afraid, but an angel comforts him reminding him that God is with him. Meanwhile, the Wisemen celebrate their supposed victory and Darius spends a restless night praying that Daniel's God is protecting him. The next day, Darius runs to the Lions' Den and finds Daniel alive and well. Darius changes the law so that everybody must pray only to Daniel's God and turns to punish the scheming Wisemen, who subsequently quit their jobs and flee. This segment was also written and directed by Phil Vischer, and was also animated by Robert Ellis and Chris Olsen.\n\nSilly Song: \"The Water Buffalo Song\"\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = God Wants Me to Forgive Them?!?\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1994|10|25}}\n| ShortSummary    = The story features two short stories about forgiveness.\n\nIn the first segment, [[Pa Grape]] is the father of a family of cranky hillbilly grapes, The Grapes of Wrath, who regularly name-call and insult others and each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/pre2000/rvu-veg2.html|title=Veggie Tales: God Wants Me to Forgive Them?!?

Junior is then rescued by his dad (Dad Asparagus) who explains to The Grapes that it is not nice to pick on people and Junior forgives them at his dad's urging. But when Dad says \"Junior,\" Tom and Rosie make fun of the name. Junior is reluctant to forgive them again, so Bob and Larry try to figure out how many times one should forgive and [[List of VeggieTales characters#Qwerty|Qwerty]] shows the verse, [[Matthew 18]]:22 \"Jesus answered 'I tell you not seven times, but seventy times seven.' {{Bibleref2c|Mt.|18:21-22}}. When Rosie figures out the answer to Qwerty's question, the Grapes ask for Junior's forgiveness and the \"Grapes of Wrath\" are renamed \"The Grapes of Math\".\n\nThe second segment is \"Larry's Lagoon,\" a spoof of the [[television series]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. In this story, Larry ([[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]]) daydreams, causing a ship filled with passengers to crash on a deserted island. Due to this accident, the passengers hold a grudge against Larry, despite his apology, which causes him to run away. However, Bob ([[The Skipper]]) realizes the error of their ways and the group forgives Larry for stranding them. A [[palm tree]] named Palmy appears and congratulates everyone for their forgiveness, reminding them how important it is. The shipmates are finally able to escape the island on a bamboo helicopter cobbled together by [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|The Professor]] ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad & Mom Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]]).\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with a spoofed 'commercial' for the \"Forgive-O-Matic,\" starring [[List of VeggieTales characters#Scallion #1|Scallion #1]]\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Are You My Neighbor?\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1995|3|28}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story, which is an adaptation of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Larry the Cucumber lives in Flibber-o-loo, where everybody wears shoes on their heads. Junior Asparagus lives in Jibber-de-Lot where everyone wears pots on their heads. For days, the two cities have flung headgear at each other over a disagreement on whose is best. Upon leaving, Larry is attacked by bandits (The Scallions) who rob and bury him in the ground. Both the mayor of Flibber-o-loo (Archibald Asparagus) and a Flibbian doctor (Archibald's wife) come upon Larry, but claim to be too busy to help. Soon after, Junior comes along and helps Larry out of the ground, despite the differences of their people. After seeing the kind act of a supposed enemy, the mayor concludes that everyone should help each other, no matter how different they are. The disagreement ends and the two cities instead throw candy and flowers at each other.\n\nIn the second story, Junior Asparagus  tells Dad Asparagus that he is not going to invite a new kid, Fernando, to his birthday party because he thinks that this boy is weird. Bob and Larry arrive in their small space ship and take Junior to the Starship Applepies, having discovered the ship is in the path of a giant meteor.

While all other workers ravenously devour the chocolate, Shack (Junior Asparagus) convinces his friends Rack (Bob the Tomato) and Benny (Larry the Cucumber) to abstain, reminding them that their parents taught them that too much candy is not healthy. He emphasizes his stance by singing a lullaby called \"Think of Me\" that his mom taught him.\n\nWhen Mr. Nezzer leaves his office to discover all the workers sick except for Rack, Shack, and Benny, the three are rewarded and promoted to Junior Executives. The following day, Mr. Nezzer calls the trio into his office and informs them that he has constructed a 90-foot high bunny which he intends to force all employees to sing the \"Bunny Song\" and bow down to. To whomever sings the song, nothing in the world (such as God, church, school, healthy food, and family) is more important than the bunny. Those who object to the song will be deemed \"bad bunnies\", thrown into the factory's furnace, and burned to death.\n\nLater, at the statue's dedication ceremony, Mr. Nezzer commands all of his workers to bow and sing The Bunny Song. However, Mr. Lunt notices that the trio are not bowing or singing. Mr. Nezzer confronts the trio, and with mounting frustration, orders them to sing. Eventually, the trio respond by instead singing \"Think of Me\" to protest. Mr. Nezzer is touched, but still orders their incineration, telling the guards to take them to the furnace. Meanwhile, [[List of VeggieTales characters#The C|Laura Carrot]] plans their rescue.

Shocked, Mr. Nezzer tells the trio to come out and they emerge from the furnace unscathed. Mr. Nezzer realizes that it was God who saved the trio and, feeling guilty for his actions, apologizes to them, and the trio forgive him.\n\nSilly Song: \"The Dance of the Cucumber\"\n\n| LineColor       = 7CFC00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Dave and the Giant Pickle\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1996|4|2}}\n| ShortSummary    = The story begins in the desert near Jerusalem where Little Dave (Junior Asparagus) and his three older brothers (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd and Tom Grape) are tending a flock of sheep.

Dave then starts to wonder why little people cannot do big things.\n\nAt King Saul's camp, the Israelites and the Philistines reach a compromise to end the war quickly: They will have their two greatest fighters face off with the champion determining who shall win the war. Because the Philistines are small King Saul agrees, but he soon regrets this when the Philistines bring out the 30-foot tall [[Goliath]] ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Goliath|a giant pickle]]).

The Israelites, having been held as slaves in Egypt, are liberated by [[Moses]] (Mr. Nezzer) and led to the [[Promised Land]]. However, they flee upon seeing Goliath's family in the land and are banished from the Promised Land for forty years. Upon the completion of their forty-year exile, Moses is dead, which means that Joshua (Larry the Cucumber) has become leader of the Israelites. Joshua begins leading them back to the Promised Land, but they soon stumble upon one big obstacle that prevents them from going any further: the city of Jericho. The Israelites are soon met by the defenders of Jericho (the French Peas) who taunt them from atop the city's great walls. Joshua tries to explain that God has given the land to the Israelites and that therefore the defenders will have to step aside, but the Israelites are instead met by more insults and smug jeering. When Philippe drops a [[Slush (beverage)|slushy]] off the wall, which hits Jimmy on the head, the Israelites decide to camp out for the night.\n\nThat night, the Israelites argue about what to do. Pa Grape wants to detour to Egypt, and Jimmy and Jerry are convinced they need firepower to attack the wall, so they begin constructing a giant rocket. Meanwhile, Joshua meets the commander of the Army of the Lord (Archibald Asparagus), who tells him how the Israelites are to take Jericho: they must march around the city once a day for six days; on the seventh day they are to march around it seven times while the priests blow their horns, and all yell as loud as they can at the same time. At this point, the messenger states, the walls of Jericho will fall. Joshua is fascinated by this idea. The next morning, Joshua reports the plan to the Israelites, but they are unsure if it will work. Meanwhile, Jimmy and Jerry have finished constructing their rocket. Eventually, Joshua talks them into trying it God's way and leads them back to Jericho later that day.\n\nWhile marching around the walls, the Israelites face more trouble; the city's defenders insult them all the more while Joshua and the agitated Israelites try to ignore them and focus on their mission. Unfortunately, the taunting soon turns into a semi-frozen battle when the Jericho defenders unleash an attack on the Israelites by pelting them with slushies, forcing them to retreat. The end of the day finds the drenched and desperate Israelites on the verge of rebellion, while Joshua refuses to quit. At this point, Junior intervenes and convinces them to continue with the plan, saying that God's way always works out in the end.\n\nInspired by Junior's speech, the Israelites agree to stick with the plan, despite more slushy attacks and taunts. On the seventh day, they blow their horns and yell. At first, nothing happens. The Jericho peas laugh, but then the walls collapse.

One day, a trio of salesmen ([[List of VeggieTales Characters#The Scallions|the Scallions]]) arrive at Blueberry's tree house to promote a new local mega-store, the Stuff-Mart, saying the store has everything she needs to be happy.

During a lunch break, Blueberry sees Junior Asparagus's excitement over a new ball his dad bought for him in spite of his disappointment that his dad could not afford the train set he really wanted. Blueberry again wonders how someone can be happy with so little while she is not happy despite having everything she wants. Blueberry finally is thankful for what she has.\n\nThe ongoing deliveries make the tree house begin to fall backwards, which startles Blueberry and her butlers. They (with the exception of Larry, who is in a carrying basket) take carts and attempt to race to the house and stop the deliveries in time.

A search is then initiated to find a new Queen.\n\nLater that morning, [[Esther]] and her cousin [[Mordecai]] (Pa Grape) are discussing her friend who stole an apple. Esther lacks the courage to confront her, but Mordecai believes she shouldn't be afraid to do what is right. When Haman drives up in a faux-car to collect the eligible maidens, he spots Mordecai and orders him to bow in his presence, but Mordecai refuses as he bows down to no one except God and Xerxes. Haman then spots Esther and has her taken to the palace with the other maidens (though the relationship between Mordecai and Esther is kept secret).\n\nAt the palace, Xerxes and Haman audition the maidens to be the new Queen. When Esther takes the stage and sings, Xerxes is left in awe and the decision is made. However, Esther does not wish to be the Queen, but regardless she is crowned and ensconced in her new life against her will. One day in the throne room of the palace, Xerxes is visited by the Peaoni brothers (the French Peas), who plan to crush him with a grand piano while distracting him with a cake. Mordecai, who is hiding in a corner to avoid Haman, observes the plot and informs Esther. Esther warns Xerxes in time and the piano crashes harmlessly onto the cake. Xerxes thanks her for saving his life, but she indicates Mordecai, saying that the credit should be his.\n\nHaman banishes the Peaoni Brothers to the Island of Perpetual Tickling for their crimes of attempting to crush Xerxes and for entering the throne room uninvited. Though Xerxes believes he is safe, Haman convinces him that a greater threat awaits, which is a family that cannot be trusted. Unaware that Haman is talking about Mordecai, Xerxes unwittingly authorizes an edict to have him and his family banished to the Island of Perpetual Tickling. Mordecai finds the edict posted in the town and visits Esther on her balcony at the palace. He appeals to her to reveal Haman's evil plans to Xerxes, but she is afraid as she lacks the courage to confront Xerxes and struggles with what to do.\n\nWhile Mordecai reminds her that she need not fear to do what's right, action does not come easy for Esther. Twice, she attempts to inform Xerxes, and both times she fails, lamely inviting Xerxes and Haman to dinner instead. Meanwhile, Haman attempts to get Mordecai to bow to him again and threatens to have his banishment carried out immediately when he refuses. His attempt is foiled when Xerxes utterly humiliates him by declaring his plan to throw a parade in Mordecai's honor for saving his life. On her third attempt, Esther is finally able to muster up the courage to face Xerxes, and in the process unveils Haman's scheme, forcing Xerxes to banish him to the Island of Perpetual Tickling. Mordecai ends up filling Haman's former position as Xerxes' right-hand-man as Esther, having saved her people, gazes out the side of the palace with a smile.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 15\n| Title           = Lyle the Kindly Viking\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|3|24}}<ref>{{cite web|title=VeggieTales: Lyle the Kindly Viking Advertisement|url=https://imgur.com/tcl5XCS|website=Imgur.com (original document published by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]])|accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Omelet ([[Jimmy Gourd]]) is a prince of a kingdom in [[Denmark]] who desires some eggs \"cooked light and fluffy\" to eat.

Cavis Appythart (Bob the Tomato) and Millward Phelps (Larry the Cucumber) are jingle writers who decide to make their big break into [[musical theatre]].  While Millward is content to see their work featured on billboards and in newspapers, Cavis believes they can make a difference in crime-ridden London by staging a grand musical that will move the citizens to greater expressions of love. Their opportunity arises when Millward's Uncle Ebenezer Nezzer grants them the use of his theater on Christmas Eve. They plan the huge production of a new musical called \"The Princess and the Plumber\". However, with only three days left until Christmas Eve, they still need a script. Seymour Schwenk (Sullivan's and Gilbert's middle names) (Pa Grape), their friend and an inventor, shows up in an experimental rocket car (a direct reference to ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'') and delivers a box of light bulbs to them. Cavis maintains that if their production is glitzy and bright (electric lights are still a novelty at this time and were first introduced at the [[Savoy Theatre]] for Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'') then their show will be a bigger hit and reach more people. He plans to integrate the lights directly into the scenery itself.\n\nCavis and Millward also need to convince the city's premiere talent, Constance Effie Pickering (Madame Blueberry), to star in the lead role, and they need to get a commitment from Prince Calvin Fredrick (Mr. Lunt) to attend the premiere. While Cavis and his assistant Bob Winston (Jean-Claude Pea) work on Pickering and the Prince, Millward works to complete the script. Everything eventually starts coming together, and Cavis starts feeling confident that their production will be a huge success. After noticing a flyer for a Christmas pageant planned to occur on the same night at a local church, Cavis goes to investigate. He observes Edmund Gilbert (Junior Asparagus) preparing a low-budget children's play, and concludes that it poses no threat to their production. However, the pageant intends to feature an object called the \"Star of Christmas\". Wondering aloud about this as he leaves the church, Cavis is overheard by Arthur McHollingshead (Archibald Asparagus), a historian who reveals that the Star of Christmas is an ancient relic that has not been publicly displayed for 79 years. He rushes off with great excitement to report the news, which promptly makes the front-page headlines the next morning.\n\nFaced with the prospect of losing their audience, and in particular the Prince, to the church pageant, Cavis and Millward wish to make their own production greater and flashier, and in desperation sneak into the church to steal the Star. They are caught, however, and narrowly escape from the aged \"Moyer the Destroyer\" (Scooter Carrot) who was left to guard the relic.  With the Star and the flashy lights, Cavis is certain that \"The Princess and the Plumber\" is now a guaranteed success. But during dress rehearsal, the excessive number of lights, which Seymour had warned were a fire hazard, ignite the curtains.  The theater goes up in flames, taking with it the Star of Christmas.  As Cavis and Millward mope over this terrible turn of events, police officer Dwiglight Howarde (Jerry Gourd) arrives with Moyer to arrest them for stealing the Star. In the jail, they meet a prisoner, Charles Pincher, who laughs at their efforts to spread love by means of an elaborate stage production.  He claims that real love makes sacrifices to help others without expecting anything in return and is extremely rare.\n\nAs if on cue, Edmund and his father, Reverend Gilbert (Dad Asparagus), arrive at the jail to release Cavis and Millward, having chosen out of love not to press charges for the theft of the Star.  Cavis is moved, and he expresses his desire to attend the pageant. However, the pageant is scheduled to start in ten minutes and there is not enough time to walk there. Just then, Seymour arrives in his rocket car. He entrusts Millward to drive the vehicle and try to get them all to the church on time. After a harrowing ride fraught with collisions and near-misses, Cavis, Millward, Edmund, and Reverend Gilbert arrive at the church just as the pageant is about to start.\n\nThe pageant is a success, with Prince Calvin and Miss Pickering in attendance. Cavis finally learns that Christmas is not about glitz and grand productions, but about a baby in a manger, Jesus, who is the real \"Star of Christmas\". After the pageant, Ebenezer chews out Cavis and Millward in regards to the theater and suggests they work in his factory to pay it off (setting the stage for the events of ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#An Easter Carol (2004)|An Easter Carol]]''), after which Moyer shows them that the real Star of Christmas (the object) is safe and that the duo stole the Turtle of Damascus, which he claims most experts consider to be a hoax. The episode ends with Cavis and Millward performing a selfless act at last: they bring cookies and a gift to Charles Pincher in his jail cell, and Cavis says, smiling warmly, \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Pincher.\"\n\nAwards: The episode was nominated for [[Annie Award for Best Animated Home Entertainment Production|Best Animated Home Entertainment Production]] in the [[30th Annie Awards]], but lost to ''[[Rolie Polie Olie: The Great Defender of Fun]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annie Awards|url=https://annieawards.org/legacy/30th-annie-awards|accessdate=January 7, 2018|website=annieawards.org|date=February 1, 2003}}</ref>\n\n''Note'': The episode was originally going to be released in July 30, 2002, but it was rescheduled back to October 29, 2002.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| Title           = The Wonderful World of Auto-tainment!\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2003|5|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = After Larry and Bob briefly argue over the theme song, a door opens up and they come out of it. Throughout the beginning, Larry slowly reveals the \"Wonderful World of Auto-Tainment\" to Bob. The Ventrilomatic and Rusty (from the ''[[3-2-1 Penguins!]]'' series) play a role in this episode as the adjudicators, as does Mr. Lunt (as the \"Techno-Gourd of the future\"), who runs the machine, which consists of the Wheel of Veggies, which spins most of the ''VeggieTales'' cast as if on a roulette, and the Swarming Balls of Disorder, which determine both the topic and genre of the song. Whoever is randomly selected by the wheel will be kicked off the machine and into a performance room, being forced to sing a song in the process. The French Peas (Phillipe and Jean-Claude), Pa Grape, Archibald Asparagus, and Junior Asparagus are forced to sing songs.\n\nThe French Pea duo starts off the show by singing the [[cumulative song]] \"There's a hole in bottom of the sea\" with a slide show. Pa Grape is second, singing \"[[Zacchaeus (song)|Zacchaeus Was a Wee Little Man]].\"\n\nThe show takes a break as animated parable \"Lunch\" is shown. A blue man named Ed (accompanied by his green dog, Mozart) tries to buy a treat from a vending machine, but the serve (\"Yummy\") button does not work. Frustrated, he tries to smack the button enough so it will work, but the machine falls on him. With barely enough strength, he lifts the machine, trying to get it back in its former position, when his treat slips out of the deposit area. He tries to get it, but is crushed again by the machine. He manages to lift it until it is on its other side. He gets the treat and is just about to eat it when a bird poops on it. Ed mopes over the loss of his treat as the parable cuts off with a \"the end\" text screen.\n\nThe show resumes with Archibald Asparagus singing [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s \"[[I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General]].\" Rusty begins to lash out at Ventril-o-Matic. At the last second, Larry steps into the performance room, and sings \"[[You Are My Sunshine]],\" with Junior Asparagus and a flower chorus. Rusty is in bliss and requests to watch an aardvark sing. After Binky the Opera Singer walks off the stage frustrated no one has clapped for him, Pa Grape is once again selected on the wheel and sings the [[Folk music|folk song]] ''[[Low Bridge (song)|Low Bridge, Everybody Down]]''. Bob expresses his hatred of the future as Rusty begins experiencing mood swings. Junior closes the show by singing a song about going to bed, praying and telling God about his day, and talking to God about how, according to the Bible, he loves him. He also tells God about screwing up (not sharing toys, coloring on the wall, making noise, etc.). After the song, Bob and Larry announce their departure from the future by saying that they are ready to go home, so they say goodbye and travel back to the present time, with Mr. Lunt catching up to them at the last second claiming to be disturbed by Rusty and Ventril-o-Matic and wanting to go back to the present.\n\nSilly Song: None\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 19\n| Title           = The Ballad of Little Joe\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2003|8|5}}\n| ShortSummary    = As the story begins in the American Wild West in the year 1889, we are introduced to the brothers (the French Peas) and Little Joe (Larry the Cucumber) (an allusion to [[Bonanza#Michael Landon - Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright|\"Little Joe\" Cartwright]]) who all live at the \"Okie-Dokie Corral\". Among Joe's unique skills are the abilities to solve problems, organize resources, and interpret dreams. We soon learn that it is Little Joe's birthday, and the brothers' father (Pa Grape) lavishes attention and gifts upon him.\n\nWhen Joe foretells a time when his brothers will bow down before him, their jealousy turns to spite, and they decide to sell him into slavery to the Scallions. He travels on a zig-zag path and ends up in Dodgeball City in the year 1890, where he starts working at a saloon for Mr. McPotipher (Scooter Carrot), and his unique skills quickly make him an invaluable employee. Also working at the saloon is Miss Kitty (Madame Blueberry), who entertains the patrons from the stage. She also becomes jealous of Joe when he is named Employee of the Month in her place. She frames him and he is imprisoned for the theft of gold, a crime he did not commit.\n\nJoe keeps a positive attitude in jail and is able to help two inmates (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd), who have been haunted by dreams. His predictions come true: Jimmy is released and Jerry, presumably, is executed. When his reputation comes to the attention of the Mayor (Mr. Nezzer), Joe is summoned to interpret a particularly disturbing dream of the latter, in which seven fat cows are devoured by seven scrawny cows. Joe understands immediately and warns the Mayor: there will be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine from 1890 to 1897; fill the storehouses now so you will be prepared.\n\nJoe is put in charge of distributing the grain during the years of famine. When he recognizes his own family has come to procure food, he is overcome with emotion. He wants to reveal himself to them, but first needs to know if they have changed. He devises a plan where he frames the youngest brother, Benjamin (Junior Asparagus), for theft to see how they respond. When all the brothers insist on taking the fall in his place and rue the previous loss of another brother, Joe reveals his identity. Jude (Jean-Claude Pea) apologizes to Joe for what he has done to him, who explains that God used the wrong he did to turn it into good, and forgives his brothers. The story concludes with the happy reunion.\n\nSilly Song: \"Belly Button\" with Boyz in the Sink\n\nAwards: \"Belly Button\" won a [[Chicago Film Festival]] Award for Best Animated Short and was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Best Animated Short. \"Belly Button\" was also nominated for a [[GMA Dove Award]] for Best Music Video of the year in 2004.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 20\n| Title           = An Easter Carol\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|2|10}}\n| ShortSummary    = It is the day before Easter, and the local church is scheduled to have a new window unveiling service at the next day's morning service. Ebenezer Nezzer, who owns a local factory, used to attend church with his grandma when he was little, but no longer goes. Reverend Gilbert (Dad Asparagus) and his son Edmund (Junior Asparagus) agree to pay Ebenezer a visit and invite him to the Easter service. Cavis Appythart (Bob the Tomato) and Ebenezer's nephew, Millward Phelps (Larry the Cucumber), are working in Ebenezer's factory to repay him after burning down his theater more than a year prior in ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#The Star of Christmas (2002)|The Star of Christmas]]''. Cavis and Millward disagree over who should approach Ebenezer and ask for a day off for Easter. When the duo ask, Ebenezer lectures them about the history of how his grandmother started making Easter eggs. Ebenezer recalls that before his grandma died, she told him to tell everyone \"Easter means no death.\" He misunderstands this, thinking that as long as he makes Easter eggs he will keep his grandma alive forever. When Reverend Gilbert and Edmund arrive, Ebenezer explains that he plans to tear down the church and build an Easterland theme park in its place. When the four protest, Ebenezer becomes furious and kicks them out of the factory, firing Cavis and Millward in the process. The townsfolk soon learn about the news and are worried about the demolition of the church, but cannot stop Nezzer since he owns the property on which the church is located.\n\nThat night, while Ebenezer is asleep, he sees a vision of his grandma telling him he has missed the point of Easter, and at the stroke of midnight, he will receive a second visitor to help him understand. Meanwhile, Cavis and Millward attempt, but fail, to break into the factory to steal the Easterland plans. Mr. Nezzer then wakes up from his vision and then intends to stay awake for the visitor. He falls asleep waiting for the visitor, and at the stroke of midnight, a clockwork egg suddenly opens and an angel named [[Hope]] emerges. She wakes Ebenezer and starts showing him Easter Past, beginning with a church service. A young Ebenezer and his grandma are in attendance, and Grandma Nezzer is trying to get Ebenezer to understand the story of Easter but the young Ebenezer is mainly focused on selling his eggs and wondering why the egg he received is empty. Next, Hope shows Ebenezer Easter from a year ago, when Ebenezer first started making plastic Easter eggs. He talks to an inventor named Seymour (Pa Grape) and gets Seymour to agree to invent plastic chickens that can make plastic eggs. Seymour is not paid, but Ebenezer does give him an early free pass to Easterland much to Hope's dismay.\n\nHope and Ebenezer return to Easter Present and visit the Reverend's house, where he and Moyer (Scooter Carrot) are discussing about the church. It is revealed that Grandma Nezzer paid for all of the church windows herself, and that just before she died she commissioned the new window that they were going to unveil on Easter morning. Ebenezer remains adamant that remaining loyal to his grandma's business and Easterland is the only way to maintain her memory. Hope and Ebenezer then learn that Edmund is sick and will die within a year if nothing changes. Ebenezer is shocked and does not understand why Edmund's parents are so calm with such news. Hope then takes Ebenezer back into the church and teaches him the story of Jesus' life, his Crucifixion, and eventually his Resurrection. With a deeper understanding of Easter's eternal significance, Ebenezer finally accepts his grandmother's passing.\n\nHope then welcomes Nezzer to Easter Future. The church is being demolished, the orphanage is gone, Little Edmund has died, and the town's once-brave policeman (Jerry Gourd) has lost the courage to stop criminals. Hope disappears back into the egg and Ebenezer pleads for her to come back because they need her. He rushes back to the church to try to stop the demolition and wakes up. He finds out it is still Easter Present and that he has another chance. Ebenezer arrives at the church and stops the crew (the French Peas) just as demolition is about to start.\n \nMillward suddenly rushes in and shouts that the factory is about to explode and that Cavis is trapped inside. Ebenezer rushes back into the factory to save Cavis, and they escape by flinging themselves through one of the factory's windows by use of a machine just as the factory explodes. It starts raining Easter eggs across the town and Ebenezer promises to help fix up the orphanage and help young Edmund get the medicine he needs with the money he has left.\n\nGuest Star: [[Rebecca St. James]] as Hope\n\n\n\nFeatured Song: Hope's Song\n\n''Note'': The episode was originally going to be released in August 5, 2003, but it was rescheduled back to February 10, 2004.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 21\n| Title           = A Snoodle's Tale\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2004|5|18}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story, an English gentleman named Mr. Butterbun (Scooter Carrot) and his butler Poole (Larry the Cucumber) are obsessing about Mr. Sly, a flashy disco dancer who performs on the street at night. The neighbors, including Poole, seem to enjoy his performances, but Butterbun is deeply suspicious. When the dancer disappears into the home of Dr. Jiggle (Jimmy Gourd), he insists that they warn the doctor. Dr. Jiggle also admits to being impressed by the Mr. Sly's fantastic moves, and confesses a desire to be a dancer himself. Unfortunately for him, his portly stature makes this impossible with his jiggly belly being a target for ridicule. When Butterbun requests an audience with Mr. Sly, Dr. Jiggle becomes frantic and quickly shows his guests the doorstep.\n\nButterbun is determined to find out who Mr. Sly really is and why he keeps disappearing into Dr. Jiggle's house. He enlists Poole to set a trap for him, to detain him while he dances and remove his disguise; but this plan fails when Poole instead gets caught up in the dance. The following night, Jiggle faints, and Sly appears again. Butterbun discovers that Jiggle and Sly are the same gourd, and Jiggle confesses to take dance class. Butterbun tells Jiggle that's great and he did not need to hide in a disguise because he's special just the way [[God]] made him. Dr. Jiggle finds out that he can dance in his own way.\n\nIn \"A Snoodle's Tale,\" Bob narrates the story of a whimsical little creature known as a Snoodle. The Snoodles live in Snoodleburg, a town which features prominently a large clock tower in the center. Every fourth Tuesday, it spits out a new Snoodle which slides down a chute to join the Snoodle society. The viewers then witness the birth of one such creature named Snoodle Doo. He is born without any knowledge of his talents or abilities, but has on his back a backpack which contains paints, a paintbrush, and a [[kazoo]]. He also discovers he has wings. Attempting to figure out his purpose in life, he tries to utilize these gifts: first flying and then painting. But his attempts are met with ridicule by the older, more experienced Snoodles. Making matters worse, they paint him pictures of his failures and stuff them into his backpack. The weight of these pictures (and figuratively their ridicule) drag him down, making him feel worthless.\n\nHe decides to leave Snoodleburg and, observing the finches flying freely over Mt. Ginches, decides that he too will go there. After an arduous climb he eventually reaches the peak. There he meets a Stranger, the Creator of the Snoodles (which is a representation of God himself), who lives in a cave high above the clouds. The Stranger asks the Snoodle why he is so dejected, and the Snoodle explains that it is because he is no good at anything. The Stranger invites him in for tea and throws the hurtful pictures into the fire, assuring him that they look nothing like him. The Creator then draws him a new picture, one that shows him confident and proud, which encourages Snoodle Doo to not just fly, but to soar. Snoodle Doo's own picture, the one ridiculed by his elders, is then hung by the Stranger on his fridge. The story ends as the young Snoodle flies back to Snoodleburg and tells of his journey to the others.\n\nSilly Song: \"Sport Utility Vehicle\"\n\nNote: This is the first episode to be released after [[Classic Media]] brought [[VeggieTales]] and [[Big Idea Entertainment]].

While Mr. Lunt and Jerry give up on the seemingly impossible task, Larry perseveres and is rewarded for his eventual success.\n\nIn the second segment, Lutfi presents a story about the origin of [[St. Patrick's Day]]. The story tells about [[Maewyn Succat]], a young English boy who is kidnapped by pirates and sold as a slave in [[Ireland]]. His new life is miserable and he spends his days in constant prayer, even as those around him celebrate [[paganism]]. When God tells him it is time to leave, Succat runs away and returns to England by way of France. Back at home, Maewyn continues his scholarship and dreams that the people of Ireland are begging him to come back and teach them about [[Christianity]]. Succat grows up to become a [[bishop]], is rechristened \"[[Saint Patrick|Patrick]]\", and fulfills his destiny to return to Ireland.\n\nIn the third segment, the titular story parodies the [[The Karate Kid (franchise)|Karate Kid]] and [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky film series]], mainly [[Rocky III|the third Rocky movie]], as well as [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[operetta]] [[The Mikado]]. \"The Italian Scallion\" (Larry the Cucumber) is a [[sumo]] wrestler who has difficulty taking anything seriously. He succeeds in injuring his sparring partner Po-Ta-To as a result of his clowning around when Po slips on a banana peel and falls from the ring, injuring his back.\n\nHe is admonished for his joking by Mikey ([[Pa Grape]]), who accuses him of being weak, lacking ambition, and never completing what he starts when young Hadrian (Junior Asparagus) reminds him that he has not yet fixed his bike. Meanwhile, the Champion, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Apollo Gourd|Apollo Gourd]], is looking for an opponent now that Po has been injured. The prize is a new \"Tiger Bike\". Wanting the bike for Hadrian, Scallion accepts the challenge. Mikey agrees to become his trainer on the condition that Scallion does everything he says.\n\nScallion starts out well and trains hard, but when things get difficult, he quits. However, when Scallion sees Hadrian emulating him he realizes that he must set a good example and persevere. He returns to his training with relish and eventually is ready for his match with Apollo Gourd, though naturally no one gives him a chance. However, Scallion does surprisingly well in the match. He lasts longer in the ring than anyone ever has against Apollo. When they both tumble out of the ring at the same moment, the match is called a tie. Unfortunately, this means that Apollo remains the champion. In spite of this, Scallion is victorious for having persevered and even completes the repairs to Hadrian's bike.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with \u201cSchoolhouse Polka with Larry\u201d (\"School House Polka\")\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| Title           = Duke and the Great Pie War\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|3|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story takes place in Egypt, Miriam (Laura Carrot) wonders why people in the Egyptian village refuse to acknowledge that her new baby brother Moses is a boy. She is forced to look after the baby because her parents and elder brother Aaron are working in the brickyards. She finds babysitting tougher than she thought and complains about her plight. But when Aaron is almost run down by a chariot, she learns the value of family. Once she learns that the [[Egyptians]] (the French Peas) are taking away all the Hebrew baby boys, Miriam decides to hide Baby Moses in the [[Nile River]]. After he is plucked out of the river by Pharaoh's daughter ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Miss Achmetha|Miss Achmetha]]), Miriam offers to have her family care for the new prince.\n\nIn the main feature, Duke Duke (Larry the Cucumber) is a knight from the Kingdom of Scone in the Middle Ages from 1000 to 1500 AD. However, he is terrible at jousting and enrolls in \"Ye Old Knight School\" for training. When he fails a jousting test, he receives a disapproving look from the arrogant \"Otis The Elevated\" (Mr. Lunt). While walking with his friend Lucas (Bob The Tomato) one day, he comes across the sweet Princess Petunia ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Petunia Rhubarb|Petunia Rhubarb]]). Petunia is a Rhubarbarian who has been exiled from her own land and has taken refuge with her poor mother-in-law, Nona (Madame Blueberry) who is Duke's cousin. Duke is smitten with the exiled princess, despite her being a foreigner who is hated by the people of Scone, due to her relatives fighting against them in the Great Pie War.\n\nNona reveals the history of the family to Duke, how Petunia was the wife of the prince of Scone, how Duke is related to both Petunia and Otis, and how Otis precipitated the Great Pie War after refusing to take care of his family. Nona then gives Duke half of a key to the vault of the family castle and says that Otis was given the other half of it. In order to have the key made whole and Petunia restored, Duke must challenge Otis to a joust. The next day the joust is set up and the audience arrives to watch. The contest involves multiple challenges, among them an obstacle course and a riddle from the Abbott of Costello (Scallion #1). The obstacle course is won by Otis and Duke solves the riddle. With the contest tied, Duke and Otis are required to joust each other using pies to determine the winner. Otis has superior skill, but when the crowd hears Otis' boasting of his selfishness and ruthlessness, the audience starts cheering for Duke which helps him find the motivation he needs to succeed. In the end, Duke marries Petunia and they live happily ever after. This sets up the events for ''King George and the Ducky'', as the Great Pie War is still ongoing when the movie happens.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with \"The Blues With Larry\"\n\nAwards: This episode won a [[Parents' Choice Award]].\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| Title           = Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|6|28}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story, Junior Asparagus is discouraged when a big bully named Gourdon claims the playground as his own and threatens to pound anyone who trespasses.

However, after a chain of events, his archenemy, Professor Rattan (Mr. Lunt), ends up swiping the Golden Carrot Nose and saying, \"Finders keepers!\" At the children's museum, Minnesota complains about Rattan to his assistant, Martin (Bob the Tomato). Then, a Parkman from New York City (Scallion #1) arrives to inform Minnesota about a plot to steal Samson's (the Peach) hairbrush, which is believed to possess the great powers of Samson. Apparently, Canadians want to use the power of the hairbrush to take over both halves of Niagara Falls. Assuming that Samson's strength came from his long hair, Minnesota decides he wants to use the power of the brush to get revenge on Rattan. Martin tries to tell him that the trip won't be about getting even with Rattan but Cuke rejects Martin's idea in favor of his own.\n\nThe first stop in his search, is an ice cream shop in [[Malta]]. He seeks advice from an old friend, a former archaeologist named Julia (Petunia Rhubarb). She gives him an address where he can find out more. Shortly after he leaves, Rattan arrives seeking the same information. When Julia refuses, Rattan sets the freezer to melt causing strawberry ice cream to flood the entire shop. Minnesota returns to save Julia, and she informs Minnesota they need to go to [[Seville]].\n\nIn the Barbershop of Seville, they are welcomed by barbers Figaro and Leo, who tell Minnesota of the Catacombs where the hairbrush is secluded. They offer him a map, which Rattan immediately steals. However, they also inform Minnesota of a shortcut to the Catacombs. Minnesota finds the hairbrush, but is confronted by Rattan (who thinks that the reason the brush doesn't work for Cuke is because he has no hair), and the Parkman (who was working for Rattan the entire time) who have captured Julia. Minnesota offers him the brush for Julia's freedom. Martin calls and claims that the brush has no power, and that Samson's power came from God rather than the artifact. Minnesota and Julia escape the Catacombs but again run into Rattan and the Parkman. Figaro and Leo arrive with two [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mounties]] (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd) who attempt to arrest Rattan, but Minnesota shows compassion by convincing them to let him go. This redeems Rattan, who offers the brush in return for friendship and Minnesota keeps it in the children's museum.\n\nSilly Song: \"Pizza Angel\"\nFeatured Music Video: \"Minnesota Cuke Theme Song\" performed by [[Charlie Daniels]]\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| Title           = Lord of the Beans\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|11|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = Randalf (Mr. Nezzer) arrives in the shire for Billboy Baggypants' (Archibald Asparagus) 122nd birthday party.

Randalf remarks on Billboy's impressive height, his fine clothing, and his luxuriously appointed home, knowing they have come from the bean, and warns his friend of using such things lightly. Billboy concedes that the bean has given him almost everything he could want. He then announces that he is leaving the shire due to dissatisfaction and bequeathing everything he owns, including the bean, to his nephew, Toto (Junior Asparagus).\n\nWaiting for Toto, Randalf relates that Billboy has departed and draws his attention to the bean. Toto is curious as to why he would want a bean and Randalf describes the origin of a magical bean that could produce clothing, consumables, and small kitchen appliances, and also change your appearance. After verifying the bean's authenticity from an inscription left after warming it in the fire, Toto is unsure about accepting such a gift and tries to pass it off to Randalf. However, Randalf explains that one cannot choose his gifts and must determine for himself how they should best be used.\n\nHe then suggests that Toto travel to the Elders of the Razzberry Forest for insight with some friends that he has already gathered to assist with the journey: the ranger, Ear-a-Corn (Larry the Cucumber); the elf, Leg-O-Lamb (Jimmy Gourd); the dwarf, Grumpy (Pa Grape); and Leg-O-Lamb's brother (Jerry Gourd) who had nothing better to do. They trek through the Mountains of Much Snowia and eventually reach the Razzberry Forest.  There, Randalf warns the others not to laugh because the elders have lost their sense of humor. The Elders welcome them and inform Randalf that they must travel to the Land of Woe. The others burst into laughter upon hearing the greetings and native tongue of the Elders, which involves blowing raspberries. This gets them sentenced to detention on a platform forever until an eagle \"saves\" them and they escape. Leaving the forest, they emerge near the entrance to the Land of Woe. After opening the door, they realize that Toto is the only one small enough to fit through and he proceeds alone. However, the remainder of the group soon learns that a group of sporks, minions of the evil Scaryman (Scallion #1), are after Toto in order to seize the bean for their master. The fellowship then goes in pursuit.\n\nIn the Land of Woe, Toto encounters a strange creature named Ahem (Mr. Lunt), who reveals that he was once a normal flobbit like Toto and the former owner of the bean. Ahem then agrees to accompany Toto into Woe as a guide. Meanwhile, the others charge through the Red Gate, only to be trapped by the Sporks. The \"Other Elf\" (Who resembles the [[Keebler]] elf) then bakes cookies in a tree and gives them to the Sporks who have not eaten anything for days and the fellowship journeys on. Toto and Ahem arrive in Woe to find a desperate people lacking the most basic necessities, such as food and water. Ahem wants Toto to leave them, to use the bean for his own creature comforts, but Toto recognizes that he can use it to help the people of Woe. The fellowship arrives just ahead of Scaryman, who steals the bean. However, Billboy suddenly reappears, recovering the bean and returning it to Toto. Toto throws the bean into the well, bringing water back to the Land of Woe and restoring it to its fertile and beautiful state.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with \u201cSilly Songs with Elves\u201d (\"My Baby Elf\")\n\nFeatured Music Video: \"It's About Love\" performed by [[Wynonna Judd]]\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| Title           = Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|11}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Screencapture of VeggieTales: Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler DVD in stores March 11|url=https://imgur.com/P2MtoD7 |website=Imgur.com (original document published by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]])|accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In the first story, knight Don Quixote (Archibald Asparagus) dreams he is facing three Peas in a world made of cooking utensils and foods.

Both of them claim they have their latest case wrapped up. However, Sheerluck takes all the credit, upsetting Watson. After leaving, Scooter Carrot (as a running gag, his Scottish/English accent is so thick that not even his fellow Englishmen can understand him) informs the duo of a plot to steal the Golden Ruler. At the palace, they meet up with the prime minister (Archibald Asparagus) and find clues. The police, Fish and Chips (Mr. Nezzer and Mr. Lunt), want to solve the case themselves.

However, there is one concern about a mysterious web that has appeared around the statue of Obadiah Bumbly in the town square. While the townspeople fret and prepare for the celebration, LarryBoy is in the Larry-Mobile on his way back to the Larry-Cave, snacking on chocolate truffles. His butler, Alfred (Archibald Asparagus), reminds him that eating too much chocolate will make him sick and compromise his abilities as a superhero. Back at the cave, LarryBoy becomes sick and admits that he can't control his chocolate addiction. With help from Alfred, he begins an exercise regimen that aims to limit the chocolate in his diet.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious villain apple named the Bad Apple is formulating a plan to derail the city's celebration. Her strategy is to enslave everyone by their own personal temptations, allowing her to take over the city of Bumblyburg while everybody is incapacitated. She tasks her sidekick, Curly the Worm, with identifying the weaknesses of each of the city's most important citizens: Mayor Blueberry, Reporter Petunia, and LarryBoy, for she believes that eliminating these three will cripple the city's leadership, communication, and law enforcement.\n\nShe begins by paying a visit to Mayor Blueberry, whose weakness is vanity. Bad Apple preys on this weakness by convincing her that as a representative of Bumblyburg, it is her duty to look her best and spins a web (a trap) in which she claims there are countless beautiful things to improve the mayor's appearance. Her vanity validated, the Mayor steps into the trap. Next, she pays a visit to Petunia, whose weakness is playing video games. Petunia realizes her important role in keeping the city informed, but admits that she could use a break. Bad Apple spins another trap, this one containing a test version of the latest, unreleased video game system. Unable to resist the temptation, Petunia steps into the trap to play. Meanwhile, back at the Larry-Cave, Alfred has discovered that the mysterious webs have plagued Bumblyburg before. On an old, scratchy film reel, he learns that an apple named Ephraim Apply tried to ensnare the settlers of the new town with diversions at an establishment called Apply's Funhouse. The people succumbed and the town suffered until Obadiah Bumbly arrived in time to liberate the people and banish Ephraim Apply forever.\n\nThe Bad Apple pays a visit to LarryBoy, and, having learned of his weakness for chocolate, uses it to gain entrance to the Larry-Cave. Little by little, she dampens his resolve until he too falls into a trap designed specifically for him. With Larry indisposed in the \"Chocolate Room\", she easily breaks Alfred upon his return, ensnaring him by the television in front of his favorite cartoon. With Bumblyburg's leaders and heroes out of the way, the Bad Apple proceeds to the town square to fulfill her great-uncle Ephraim's destiny: opening up the new and improved \"Apply's Funhouse II\". She and Curly begin to lure the helpless citizens into the funhouse. At the Larry-Cave, Alfred and LarryBoy realize that they need each other's help to fight the temptation. Working together, they dissolve the webs of their traps, then quickly set out to rescue Mayor Blueberry and Petunia. They then all rush to the town square to fight temptation together. As LarryBoy fights the Bad Apple, the funhouse topples and nearly crushes a mother and her baby. LarryBoy saves them and all of Bumblyburg by flinging the funhouse, along with the Bad Apple and Curly, out of the square and out of the city.\n\nSilly Song: Replaced with a music video for \"Rock On, LarryBoy\".\n\nAward: This episode also won a [[Parents' Choice Award]].\n\nNOTE: This is the first episode released on Blu-Ray.\n\n| LineColor       = DA70D6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| Title           = Gideon: Tuba Warrior\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|11|7}}\n| ShortSummary    = The first story is narrated by the Captain of The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything (Pa Grape), as he tells it through the eyes of his ancestor Great-Grandfather Simon, a reporter for the ''Bristol Snoop'', a tabloid-like newspaper.

They pray to God for food and the next day when Simon offers to go out and buy them food, the baker and milkman (Jimmy and Jerry Gourd) miraculously come in and offers the children milk and bread.\n\nThe story of Gideon is played featuring Larry the Cucumber in the title role. Beginning with a montage of floats, as a victory parade for conquering the Midianites, Gideon stops the parade to explain that the large amount of praise lavished on him was not his to take. He then tells the \"true\" account, in which he reluctantly chooses to defend his country against an undefeated army of over 30,000 excessively hairy pickles, the Midianites, after an angel (Pa Grape) appears to him. Initially, he doesn't want to, and says that he's not a warrior, that he's afraid of the dark and screams like a girl, to which the angel replies, \"He (the Almighty) chose you\", \"to say the truth I'm afraid of the dark too,\" and \"Put me in the dark and I scream like a girl too.\" Gideon then asks for the miracle of a wet fleece and dry ground, which when the sign is complete, asks for another sign that the fleece be dry and the ground around drenched.

This had probably been stolen by Watson, the porter, who was left in charge when Bront\u00eb went drinking. This was attributed to incompetence rather than theft and the missing sum was deducted from his salary.<ref name=Marshall52/>\nA description by Francis Leyland of Bront\u00eb at this time described him as \"rather below middle height, but of a refined and gentleman-like appearance, and of graceful manners. His complexion was fair and his features handsome; his mouth and chin were well-shaped; his nose was prominent and of the Roman type; his eyes sparkled and danced with delight, and his forehead made up of a face of oval form which gave an irresistible charm to its possessor, and attracted the admiration of those who knew him.\"<ref name=\"Dinsdale2006\"/> Another described him less flatteringly as \"almost insignificantly small\" and with \"a mass of red hair which he wore brushed off his forehead \u2013 to help his height I fancy... small ferrety eyes, deep sunk and still further hidden by the never removed spectacles.\"<ref name=\"Dinsdale2006\"/>\n\nIn January 1843, after nine months at Haworth,<ref name=\"BarnardBarnard2013\"/> Bront\u00eb took up another tutoring position in Thorp Green, where he was to tutor the Reverend Edmund Robinson's young son.<ref name=odnb/> His sister Anne had been the governess there since May 1840.<ref name=\"BarnardBarnard2013\"/> As usual, at first things went well, with Charlotte reporting in January 1843 that her siblings were \"both wonderously valued in their situations.\"<ref name=\"BarnardBarnard2013\"/> During his 30 months service Branwell corresponded with several old friends about his increasing [[Limerence|infatuation]] with Robinson's wife Lydia, n\u00e9e Gisborne, a charming and sophisticated woman, almost fifteen years senior to him.<ref name=odnb/> He wrote, perhaps unreliably, to one of his friends that \"my mistress is DAMNABLY TOO FOND OF ME\" and sent him a \"lock of her hair, wch has lain at night on his breast \u2013 wd to God it could do so legally !\"<ref name=\"BarnardBarnard2013\"/> In July 1845, he was dismissed from his position.<ref name=\"BarnardBarnard2013\"/> According to Gaskell, he received a letter \"sternly dismissing him, intimating that his proceedings were discovered, characterising them as bad beyond expression and charging him, on pain of exposure, to break off immediately, and for ever, all communication with every member of the family.\"<ref name=Gaskell/> Multiple explanations have been given for this, including inappropriate relationships with a Robinson daughter or son, or that he had passed forged cheques.<ref name=\"BarnardBarnard2013\"/> The most likely explanation is Bront\u00eb's own account that he had an affair with Mrs Robinson which Bront\u00eb hoped would lead to marriage after her husband's death.
