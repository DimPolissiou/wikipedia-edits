It returned one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], elected by the [[first past the post]] system.\n\nThe constituency was created for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and abolished for the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]].\n\n== Boundaries ==\n\n===1918\u20131950===\nThe constituency was created as a result of the Report of the Boundary Commission in 1917, when it was recommended to be called \"Manchester Newton Heath\".<ref name=\"Newton Heath\">\"Parliamentary Borough of Manchester\" in Schedule part II of \"Report of the Boundary Commission (England and Wales), 1917\", [[Command paper|Cd. 8756]].</ref> However, when the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Bill]] to give effect to the Commission's recommendations was debated in Parliament, the Government accepted an amendment to change the name to Clayton.<ref name=\"Name changed\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 30 November 1917, p. 12.</ref> The new constituency came into effect at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. Although Parliament had altered the recommended name, it retained the recommended boundaries, and was defined as consisting of three municipal [[ward (politics)|wards]] of the [[county borough]] of [[Manchester]], namely [[Beswick, Greater Manchester|Beswick]], [[Bradford, Manchester|Bradford]] and [[Newton Heath]].<ref>''Ninth Schedule, Part I: Parliamentary Boroughs'', 1918 c.64 sch.9</ref>\n\n===1950\u20131955===\nConstituencies throughout [[Great Britain]] were reorganised by the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]], which introduced the term \"[[borough constituency]]\". '''Manchester, Clayton Borough Constituency''' was redefined to comprise four wards: Beswick, Bradford, [[Miles Platting]] and Newton Heath. Miles Platting had previously formed part of the [[Manchester Platting (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Platting]] seat.<ref>''First Schedule: Parliamentary Constituencies'', 1948 c.65 sch.1</ref> The revised boundaries were first used in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]].\n\n===Abolition===\nFollowing a report by the boundary commissioners appointed under the [[House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949]], constituencies in the Manchester area were reorganised in 1955.\nThe Clayton constituency was abolished, with its area divided between the [[Manchester Cheetham (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Cheetham]] and [[Manchester Openshaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Openshaw]] seats.<ref>''Parliamentary

It returned one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], elected by the [[first past the post]] system.\n\nThe constituency was created for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and abolished for the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]].\n\n== Boundaries ==\n\n===1918\u20131950===\nThe constituency was created as a result of the Report of the Boundary Commission in 1917, when it was recommended to be called \"Manchester Newton Heath\".<ref name=\"Newton Heath\">\"Parliamentary Borough of Manchester\" in Schedule part II of \"Report of the Boundary Commission (England and Wales), 1917\", [[Command paper|Cd. 8756]].</ref> However, when the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Bill]] to give effect to the Commission's recommendations was debated in Parliament, the Government accepted an amendment to change the name to Clayton.<ref name=\"Name changed\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 30 November 1917, p. 12.</ref> The new constituency came into effect at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. Although Parliament had altered the recommended name, it retained the recommended boundaries, and was defined as consisting of three municipal [[ward (politics)|wards]] of the [[county borough]] of [[Manchester]], namely [[Beswick, Greater Manchester|Beswick]], [[Bradford, Manchester|Bradford]] and [[Newton Heath]].<ref>''Ninth Schedule, Part I: Parliamentary Boroughs'', 1918 c.64 sch.9</ref>\n\n===1950\u20131955===\nConstituencies throughout [[Great Britain]] were reorganised by the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]], which introduced the term \"[[borough constituency]]\". '''Manchester, Clayton Borough Constituency''' was redefined to comprise four wards: Beswick, Bradford, [[Miles Platting]] and Newton Heath. Miles Platting had previously formed part of the [[Manchester Platting (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Platting]] seat.<ref>''First Schedule: Parliamentary Constituencies'', 1948 c.65 sch.1</ref> The revised boundaries were first used in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]].\n\n===Abolition===\nFollowing a report by the boundary commissioners appointed under the [[House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949]], constituencies in the Manchester area were reorganised in 1955.\nThe Clayton constituency was abolished, with its area divided between the [[Manchester Cheetham (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Cheetham]] and [[Manchester Openshaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Openshaw]] seats.<ref>''Parliamentary
