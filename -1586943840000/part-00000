The term was first used by the British press and is the German word for 'lightning'.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170707085619/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/the_blitz BBC History]</ref>\n\nThe Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns, and cities, beginning with raids on London towards the end of the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940 (a battle for daylight [[air superiority]] between the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and the [[Royal Air Force]] over the United Kingdom). By September 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' had failed and the German air fleets (''[[Luftflotte]]n'') were ordered to attack [[London]], to draw [[RAF Fighter Command]] into a [[battle of annihilation]].<ref name=\"Price 1990, p. 12\">Price 1990, p. 12.</ref><ref>Ray 2009, pp. 104\u2013105.</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] and ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the ''Luftwaffe'', ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940. From 7 September 1940, London was systematically bombed by the ''Luftwaffe'' for 56 of the following 57 days and nights.<ref>Stansky 2007, p. 28.</ref> Most notable was a large daylight attack against London on [[Battle of Britain Day|15 September]].\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of night attacks to evade attack by the RAF, and the Blitz became a night bombing campaign after October 1940. The ''Luftwaffe'' attacked the main [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] sea port of [[Liverpool]] in the [[Liverpool Blitz]]. The [[North Sea]] port of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, suffered the [[Hull Blitz]]. [[Bristol Blitz|Bristol]], [[Cardiff Blitz|Cardiff]], [[Portsmouth Blitz|Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth Blitz|Plymouth]], [[Southampton Blitz|Southampton]] and [[Swansea Blitz|Swansea]] were also bombed, as were the industrial cities of [[Birmingham Blitz|Birmingham]], [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast]], [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry]], [[Glasgow Blitz|Glasgow]], [[Manchester Blitz|Manchester]] and [[Sheffield Blitz|Sheffield]]. More than 40,000&nbsp;civilians were killed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing during the war, almost half of them in the capital, where more than a million houses were destroyed or damaged.<ref name=\"Richards 1954, p. 217.\">Richards 1954, p. 217.</ref>\n\nIn early July 1940, the German High Command began planning [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union.<ref>Bungay, Stephen (2000).

Poor intelligence about British industry and economic efficiency led to ''OKL'' concentrating on tactics rather than strategy. The bombing effort was diluted by attacks against several sets of industries instead of constant pressure on the most vital.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\" /><ref>Overy 1980, pp. 34, 36.</ref><!--needs a bit about Br success too-->\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Luftwaffe'' and strategic bombing===\n{{Main|Strategic bombing}}\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, [[airpower]] theorists such as [[Giulio Douhet]] and [[Billy Mitchell]] claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating the need for land and sea combat.<ref>Cox and Gray 2002, p. xvii.</ref> It was thought that [[the bomber will always get through|bombers would always get through]] and could not be resisted, particularly at night. Industry, seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the means to make war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale and a loss of production in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The [[RAF]] and the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of [[RAF Bomber Command]] became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.<ref>Montgomery-Hyde 1976, p.&nbsp;137.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' took a cautious view of strategic bombing and ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe|OKL]]'' did not oppose the strategic bombardment of industries or cities. It believed it could greatly affect the balance of power on the battlefield by disrupting production and damaging civilian morale. ''OKL'' did not believe air power alone could be decisive and the ''Luftwaffe'' did not have a policy of systematic \"terror bombing\". (The ''Luftwaffe'' did not adopt an official policy of the deliberate bombing of civilians until 1942.)<ref>Corum 1997, p. 7.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The vital industries and transport centres that would be targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. It could be claimed civilians were not to be targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as \"terror bombing\", the concept of attacking vital war industries\u2014and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale\u2014was ruled as acceptable.<ref>Corum 1997, p.&nbsp;240</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1941, Walther Wever.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Walter Wever]]\nFrom the beginning of the [[National Socialist]] regime until 1939, there was a debate in German military journals over the role of strategic bombardment, with some contributors arguing along the lines of the British and Americans.<ref>Corum 1997, pp. 238\u2013241.</ref> General [[Walter Wever (General)|Walter Wever]] (Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff\n1 March 1935 \u2013 3 June 1936) championed strategic bombing and the building of suitable aircraft, although he emphasised the importance of aviation in operational and tactical terms. Wever outlined five points of air strategy:\n# To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories and defeat enemy air forces attacking German targets.\n# To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas, by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces\n# To support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e., armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground operations.\n# To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting German naval bases and participating directly in naval battles\n# To paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in armaments factories.<ref>Corum 1997, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\nWever argued that ''OKL'' should not be solely educated in tactical and operational matters but also in grand strategy, war economics, armament production and the mentality of potential opponents (also known as [[Cognitive traps for intelligence analysis#Types|mirror imaging]]). Wever's vision was not realised, staff studies in those subjects fell by the wayside and the Air Academies focused on tactics, technology and operational planning, rather than on independent strategic air offensives.<ref>Corum 1997, p. 252.</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Wever was killed in an air crash and the failure to implement his vision for the new ''Luftwaffe'' was largely attributable to his successors. Ex-Army personnel and his successors as Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff, [[Albert Kesselring]] (3 June 1936 \u2013 31 May 1937) and [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Stumpff]] (1 June 1937 \u2013 31 January 1939) are usually blamed for abandoning strategic planning for [[close air support]]. Two prominent enthusiasts for ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were [[Hugo Sperrle]] the commander of ''[[Luftflotte 3]]'' (1 February 1939 \u2013 23 August 1944) and [[Hans Jeschonnek]] (Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff from 1 February 1939 \u2013 19 August 1943). The ''Luftwaffe'' was not pressed into ground support operations because of pressure from the army or because it was led by ex-soldiers, the ''Luftwaffe'' favoured a model of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns.<ref>Corum 1997, p. 248.</ref>\n\n===Hitler, G\u00f6ring and air power===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-504, Berlin, Adolf Hitler und Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|Hitler and G\u00f6ring, March 1938]]\n\nHitler paid less attention to the bombing of opponents than air defence, although he promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood it was possible to use bombers for strategic purposes. He told ''OKL'' in 1939, that ruthless employment of the ''Luftwaffe'' against the heart of the British will to resist would follow when the moment was right. Hitler quickly developed scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz. He frequently complained of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, \"The munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids&nbsp;... usually the prescribed targets are not hit\".<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 410.\">Overy July 1980, p. 410.</ref>\n\nWhile the war was being planned, Hitler never insisted upon the ''Luftwaffe'' planning a strategic bombing campaign and did not even give ample warning to the air staff, that war with Britain or even Russia was a possibility. The amount of firm operational and tactical preparation for a bombing campaign was minimal, largely because of the failure by Hitler as supreme commander to insist upon such a commitment.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 410.\"/>\n\nUltimately, Hitler was trapped within his own vision of bombing as a terror weapon, formed in the 1930s when he threatened smaller nations into accepting German rule rather than submit to air bombardment.<!--mention the use of air power in the Spanish Civil War?--><!--That seems OT to me.--> This fact had important implications. It showed the extent to which Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of [[economic warfare]], with the collapse of morale as an additional bonus.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 411.\">Overy July 1980, p.&nbsp;411.</ref> Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. As the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German retaliation would persuade the Allies to adopt a policy of moderation and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was&nbsp;\u2013 for reasons of political prestige within Germany itself&nbsp;\u2013 that the German population would be protected from the Allied bombings. When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and he redoubled efforts to mount a similar \"terror offensive\" against Britain in order to produce a stalemate in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 411.\"/>\n\nA major problem in the managing of the ''Luftwaffe'' was G\u00f6ring; Hitler believed the ''Luftwaffe'' was \"the most effective strategic weapon\", and in reply to repeated requests from the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for control over aircraft insisted, \"We should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided ''Luftwaffe''.\"<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 407.\">Overy July 1980, p. 407.</ref> Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in G\u00f6ring a jealous and damaging defence of his \"empire\" while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the ''Luftwaffe'' at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and G\u00f6ring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 407.\"/> In 1940 and 1941, G\u00f6ring's refusal to co-operate with the ''Kriegsmarine'' denied the entire ''Wehrmacht'' military forces of the ''Reich'' the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the British Empire.<ref>Corum 1997, p.&nbsp;280.</ref>\n\nThe deliberate separation of the ''Luftwaffe'' from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major \"communications gap\" between Hitler and the ''Luftwaffe'', which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, G\u00f6ring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When G\u00f6ring decided against continuing Wever's [[Ural bomber|original heavy bomber]] programme in 1937, the ''Reichsmarschall's'' own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, G\u00f6ring arranged a display of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s most advanced equipment at [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Rechlin]], to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 408.\">Overy July 1980, p.&nbsp;408.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Britain===\n{{Main|Battle of Britain|Adlertag|The Hardest Day|Battle of Britain Day}}\n[[File:Pilots of No. 310 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF in front of Hawker Hurricane Mk I at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, 7 September 1940. CH1299.jpg|thumb|RAF pilots with one of their [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, October 1940]]\n\nAlthough not specifically prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the ''Luftwaffe'' was expected to do so over Britain. From July until September 1940 the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked Fighter Command to gain air superiority as a prelude to invasion. This involved the bombing of [[English Channel]] convoys, ports, and RAF airfields and supporting industries. Destroying RAF Fighter Command would allow the Germans to gain control of the skies over the invasion area. It was supposed Bomber Command, [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]], and the [[Royal Navy]] could not operate under conditions of German air superiority.<ref>McKee 1989, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'''s poor intelligence meant that their aircraft were not always able to locate their targets, and thus attacks on factories and airfields failed to achieve the desired results. British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany's by 2 to 1.<ref>Faber 1977, p. 203.</ref> The British produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany's 8,000.<ref>McKee 1989, p. 294.</ref> The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and ''Luftwaffe'' struggled to replace manpower losses, though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The circumstances affected the Germans more than the British. Operating over home territory, British aircrew could fly again if they survived being shot down. German crews, even if they survived, faced capture. Moreover, bombers had four to five crewmen on board, representing a greater loss of manpower.<ref>Faber 1977, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from the destruction of the RAF's supporting structures. German intelligence suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and an attack on London would force it into a final battle of annihilation while compelling the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1940\u20131945)|British Government]] to surrender.<ref>Price 1990, p. 12; McKee 1989, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe decision to change strategy is sometimes claimed as a major mistake by ''OKL''. It is argued that persisting with attacks on RAF airfields might have won air superiority for the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Wood and Dempster 2003, pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> Others argue that the ''Luftwaffe'' made little impression on Fighter Command in the last week of August and first week of September and that the shift in strategy was not decisive.<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 368\u2013369.</ref> It has also been argued that it was doubtful the ''Luftwaffe'' could have won air superiority before the \"weather window\" began to deteriorate in October.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 80.\"/><ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 283.\">Corum 1997, p. 283.</ref> It was also possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could pull out to the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 283.\"/> Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the ''Kriegsmarine'' would have made the projected German invasion, [[Operation Sea Lion|Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we]] (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or without German air superiority.<ref>Corum 1997, pp. 283\u2013284; Murray 1983, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Change in strategy===\nRegardless of the ability of the ''Luftwaffe'' to win air superiority, Hitler was frustrated it was not happening quickly enough. With no sign of the RAF weakening and the ''Luftflotten'' suffering many losses, ''OKL'' was keen for a change in strategy. To reduce losses further, strategy changed to prefer night raids, giving the bombers greater protection under cover of darkness.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 101.</ref>{{efn|Williamson Murray's ''Strategy for Defeat'' indicated a serious decline in operational readiness. In mid-September, Bf 109 units possessed only 67 per cent of crews against authorised aircraft, Bf 110 units just 46 per cent and bomber units 59 per cent.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=52}}}}\n\nIt was decided to focus on bombing Britain's industrial cities, in daylight to begin with. The main focus was London. The first major raid took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain. Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October, the ''Luftwaffe'' switched its main effort to night attacks. This became official policy on 7 October. The air campaign soon got under way against London and other British cities. However, the ''Luftwaffe'' faced limitations. Its aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dornier Do 17]], [[Junkers Ju 88]], and [[Heinkel He 111]]s&nbsp;\u2013 were capable of carrying out strategic missions<ref>Corum 1997, p. 282.</ref> but were incapable of doing greater damage because of their small bomb-loads.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 35.\">Overy 1980, p. 35.</ref> The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s decision in the interwar period to concentrate on [[medium bomber]]s can be attributed to several reasons: Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939; ''OKL'' believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a [[heavy bomber]] force; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war.<ref>Murray 1983, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAlthough it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the ''Luftwaffe'' had unclear strategy and poor intelligence. ''OKL'' had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938. It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries. Moreover, ''OKL'' could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the ''Luftwaffe'' should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population.<ref>Murray 1983, p. 54; McKee 1989, p. 255.</ref> The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940\u20131941.<ref>Overy 1980, pp. 34, 37.</ref> Disputes among ''OKL'' staff revolved more around tactics than strategy.<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 38; Hooton 2010, p. 90.</ref> This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 379.</ref>\n\nIn an operational capacity, limitations in weapons technology and quick British reactions were making it more difficult to achieve strategic effect. Attacking ports, shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas, especially the distribution of coal, an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War, would net a positive result. However, the use of [[delayed-action bomb]]s, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate.{{efn|This was caused by moisture ruining the electrical [[fuze]]s. German sources estimated 5\u201310 per cent of bombs failed to explode; the British put the figure at 20 per cent.{{sfn|Hooton|2010|p=84}}}} The British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities, making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the [[Committee on Imperial Defence]] estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1.2 million wounded. News reports of the [[Spanish Civil War]], such as the [[bombing of Barcelona]], supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938, experts generally expected that Germany would try to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high-explosive and [[Incendiary device#Development and use in World War II|incendiary bombs]], the Germans could use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.<ref>Titmuss 1950, pp. 4\u20136,9,12\u201313.</ref> In 1939 military theorist [[Basil Liddell-Hart]] predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\"/> London hospitals prepared for 300,000 casualties in the first week of war.{{r|gunther1940}}\n\nBritish [[air raid siren]]s sounded for the first time 22 minutes after [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|Neville Chamberlain declared war on Germany]].

Many popular works of fiction during the 1920s and 1930s portrayed aerial bombing, such as [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' and its [[Things to Come|1936 film adaptation]], and others such as ''The Air War of 1936'' and ''The Poison War''. [[Harold Macmillan]] wrote in 1956 that he and others around him \"thought of air warfare in 1938 rather as people think of nuclear war today\".<ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 39\u201341.</ref>\n\nBased in part on the experience of German bombing in the First World War, politicians feared mass psychological trauma from aerial attack and the collapse of civil society. In 1938, a committee of psychiatrists predicted three times as many mental as physical casualties from aerial bombing, implying three to four million psychiatric patients.<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 20.</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] told Parliament in 1934, \"We must expect that, under the pressure of continuous attack upon London, at least three or four million people would be driven out into the open country around the metropolis\".<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\"/> Panic during the [[Munich crisis]], such as the migration by 150,000 people to Wales, contributed to fear of social chaos.<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe government planned the [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation]] of four million people&nbsp;\u2013 mostly women and children&nbsp;\u2013 from urban areas, including 1.4 million from London. It expected about 90% of evacuees to stay in private homes, conducted an extensive survey to determine the amount of space available and made detailed preparations for transporting evacuees. A trial [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]] was held on 10 August 1939 and when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September, a blackout began at sunset. Lights were not allowed after dark for almost six years and the blackout became by far the most unpopular aspect of the war for civilians, even more than [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]].<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 34\u201342, 90, 97.</ref> The relocation of the government and the civil service was also planned but would only have occurred if necessary so as not to damage civilian morale.<ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 51, 106.</ref>\n\nMuch civil-defence preparation in the form of shelters was left in the hands of local authorities and many areas such as [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]], [[Belfast]] and the [[East End of London]] did not have enough shelters.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\">Field 2002, p. 13.</ref> The unexpected delay to civilian bombing during the Phoney War meant that the shelter programme finished in June 1940, before the Blitz.<ref>Mackay 2002, p. 35.</ref> The programme favoured backyard [[Air-raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]] and small brick surface shelters; many of the latter were abandoned in 1940 as unsafe.

The government did not build them for large populations before the war because of cost, time to build and fears that their safety would cause occupants to refuse to leave to return to work or that anti-war sentiment would develop in large congregations of civilians. The government saw the leading role taken by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] in advocating the building of deep shelters as an attempt to damage civilian morale, especially after the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 14.\"/><ref>Mackay 2002, p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe most important existing communal shelters were the [[London Underground]] stations. Although many civilians had used them for shelter during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids but by the second week of heavy bombing, the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4:00 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940, about 150,000 people a night slept in the Underground, although by winter and spring the numbers declined to 100,000 or less. Battle noises were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations but many people were killed from direct hits on stations.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 15.\">Field 2002, p. 15.</ref> In March 1943, 173 men, women and children were crushed to death at [[Bethnal Green tube station]] in a panic after a woman fell down the steps as she entered the station.<ref>Coates, 1999 p. 19</ref>\n\n[[File:A young woman plays a gramophone in an air raid shelter in north London during 1940.

Authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food. Tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters, to reduce the amount of time spent queuing. Committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments, and organisations such as the [[British Red Cross]] and the [[Salvation Army]] worked to improve conditions. Entertainment included concerts, films, plays and books from local libraries.<ref>Field, 2002, pp. 15\u201320.</ref>\n\nAlthough only a small number of Londoners used the mass shelters, when journalists, celebrities and foreigners visited they became part of the [[Beveridge Report]], part of a national debate on social and class division. Most residents found that such divisions continued within the shelters and many arguments and fights occurred over noise, space and other matters. Anti-Jewish sentiment was reported, particularly around the East End of London, with anti-Semitic graffiti and anti-Semitic rumours, such as that Jewish people were \"hogging\" air raid shelters.<ref>Mackay, 2002, p. 83</ref> Contrary to pre-war fears of anti-Semitic violence in the East End, one observer found that the \"Cockney and the Jew [worked] together, against the [[British Indian|Indian]]\".<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 15-20.\">Field 2002, pp. 15\u201318.</ref>\n\n===\"Blitz Spirit\"===\n\nAlthough the intensity of the bombing was not as great as pre-war expectations so an equal comparison is impossible, no psychiatric crisis occurred because of the Blitz even during the period of greatest bombing of September 1940. An American witness wrote \"By every test and measure I am able to apply, these people are staunch to the bone and won't quit ... the British are stronger and in a better position than they were at its beginning\". People referred to raids as if they were weather, stating that a day was \"very blitzy\".<ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 75, 261</ref>\n\n[[File:Bomb Damage in London during the Second World War HU36157.jpg|thumb|left|Office workers make their way to work through debris after a heavy air raid.]]\n\nAccording to [[Anna Freud]] and [[Edward Glover (psychoanalyst)|Edward Glover]], London civilians surprisingly did not suffer from widespread [[shell shock]], unlike the soldiers in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]].<ref>Ingersol, 1940, pp. 114,117\u2013118</ref> The psychoanalysts were correct, and the special network of psychiatric clinics opened to receive mental casualties of the attacks closed due to lack of need. Although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks, eating disorders, fatigue, weeping, miscarriages, and other physical and mental ailments, society did not collapse. The number of suicides and drunkenness declined, and London recorded only about two cases of \"bomb neurosis\" per week in the first three months of bombing. Many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family, and after the first few weeks of bombing, avoidance of the evacuation programmes grew.<ref>Field 2002, pp. 15\u201320.</ref><ref>Titmuss 1950, pp. 340, 349.</ref><ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe cheerful crowds visiting bomb sites were so large they interfered with rescue work,{{r|Field 2002, p. 15-20.}} pub visits increased in number (beer was never rationed), and 13,000 attended [[Lord's Cricket Ground|cricket at Lord's]]. People left shelters when told instead of refusing to leave, although many housewives reportedly enjoyed the break from housework. Some people even told government surveyors that they enjoyed air raids if they occurred occasionally, perhaps once a week. Despite the attacks, defeat in [[Battle of Norway|Norway]] and [[Battle of France|France]], and the threat of invasion, overall morale remained high; a [[Gallup poll]] found only 3% of Britons expected to lose the war in May 1940, another found an 88% approval rating for Churchill in July, and a third found 89% support for his leadership in October. Support for peace negotiations declined from 29% in February. Each setback caused more civilians to volunteer to become unpaid [[Local Defence Volunteers]], workers worked longer shifts and over weekends, contributions rose to the \u00a35,000 \"[[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] Funds\" to build fighters and the number of work days lost to strikes in 1940 was the lowest in history.<ref>Mackay2002, pp. 60\u201363, 67\u201368, 75, 78\u201379, 215\u2013216</ref>\n\n===Civilian mobilisation===\nCivilians of London played an enormous role in protecting their city. Many civilians who were unwilling or unable to join the military joined the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the [[Air Raid Precautions]] service (ARP), the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] and many other civilian organisations; the AFS had 138,000 personnel by July 1939.

Predictions had underestimated civilian adaptability and resourcefulness; also there were many new civil defence roles that gave a sense of fighting back rather than despair. Official histories concluded that the mental health of a nation may have improved, while panic was rare.<ref>Edgar Jones, et al. \"Civilian morale during the Second World War: Responses to air raids re-examined.\" ''Social History of Medicine'' 17.3 (2004): 463\u2013479.</ref>\n\n==Pre-war RAF night defence==\n{{See also|Anti-aircraft warfare}}\n\nBritish air doctrine, since [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] had commanded the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (1915\u20131917), stressed offence as the best means of defence,<ref>Hyde 1976, pp. 138, 223\u2013228.</ref> which became known as the [[cult of the offensive]]. To prevent German formations from hitting targets in Britain, Bomber Command would destroy ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft on their bases, aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants. This philosophy proved impractical, as Bomber Command lacked the technology and equipment for mass night operations, since resources were diverted to Fighter Command in the mid-1930s and it took until 1943 to catch up. Dowding agreed air defence would require some offensive action and that fighters could not defend Britain alone.<ref>Ray 2009, p. 127.</ref> Until September 1939, the RAF lacked specialist night-fighting aircraft and relied on anti-aircraft units, which were poorly equipped and lacking in numbers.<ref>Ray 1996, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref>\n\nThe attitude of the Air Ministry was in contrast to the experiences of the [[World War I|First World War]] when German bombers caused physical and psychological damage out of all proportion to their numbers. Around {{convert|280|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} (9,000 bombs) had been dropped, killing 1,413 people and injuring 3,500 more. Many people over 35 remembered the bombing and were afraid of more. From 1916\u20131918, German raids had diminished against countermeasures which demonstrated defence against night air raids was possible.<ref>Ray 2009, p. 125.</ref> Although night air defence was causing greater concern before the war, it was not at the forefront of RAF planning after 1935, when funds were directed into the new ground-based radar day fighter interception system. The difficulty of RAF bombers in night navigation and target finding led the British to believe that it would be the same for German bomber crews. There was also a mentality in all air forces that flying by day would obviate the need for night operations and their inherent disadvantages.<ref>Ray 2009, p. 126.</ref>\n\n[[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]], [[Air Officer Commanding]] Fighter Command, defeated the ''Luftwaffe'' in the Battle of Britain, but preparing day fighter defences left little for night air defence. When the ''Luftwaffe'' struck at British cities for the first time on 7 September 1940, a number of civic and political leaders were worried by Dowding's apparent lack of reaction to the new crisis.<ref name=\"Ray\">Ray 2009, p. 124.</ref> Dowding accepted that as AOC, he was responsible for the day and night defence of Britain but seemed reluctant to act quickly and his critics in the Air Staff felt that this was due to his stubborn nature. Dowding was summoned on 17 October, to explain the poor state of the night defences and the supposed (but ultimately successful) \"failure\" of his daytime strategy. The [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and Churchill distanced themselves. The failure to prepare adequate night air defences was undeniable but it was not the responsibility of the AOC Fighter Command to dictate the disposal of resources. The general neglect of the RAF until the late spurt in 1938, left few resources for night air defence and the Government, through the Air Ministry and other civil and military institutions was responsible for policy. Before the war, the Chamberlain government stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort.<ref name=\"Ray\" />\n\n==Technology==\n\n===German night navigation devices===\n{{Main|Battle of the Beams}}\n[[File:Map of Knickebein transmitters.svg|thumb|Map of Knickebein transmitters]]\n\nBecause of the inaccuracy of [[celestial navigation]] for night navigation and target finding in a fast moving aircraft, the ''Luftwaffe'' developed [[radio navigation]] devices and relied on three systems: ''[[Knickebein]]'' (Crooked leg), ''[[X-Ger\u00e4t]]'' (X-Device), and ''[[Y-Ger\u00e4t]]'' (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, which became known as the Battle of the Beams.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 194.</ref> Bomber crews already had some experience with the [[Lorenz beam]], a commercial blind-landing aid for night or bad weather landings. The Germans adapted the short-range Lorenz system into ''Knickebein'', a 30\u201333&nbsp;MHz system, which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signals. Two aerials at ground stations were rotated so that their beams converged over the target. The German bombers would fly along either beam until they picked up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and dropped their bombs.<ref>Air, 2001, p. 93</ref><ref name=\"Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328\">Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328</ref>\n\n''Knickebein'' was in general use but the ''X-Ger\u00e4t'' (X apparatus) was reserved for specially trained pathfinder crews. ''X-Ger\u00e4t'' receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the fuselage. The system worked on 66\u201377&nbsp;MHz, a higher frequency than ''Knickebein''. Ground transmitters sent pulses at a rate of 180 per minute. ''X-Ger\u00e4t'' received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot visual and aural directions. Three cross-beams intersected the beam along which the He 111 was flying. The first cross-beam alerted the bomb-aimer, who activated a bombing clock when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The clock mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bombs were released.<ref name=\"Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328\"/><ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 89.\">Mackay 2003, p. 89.</ref>\n\n''Y-Ger\u00e4t'' was an automatic beam-tracking system and the most complex of the three devices, which was operated through the autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a ground controller. Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to be measured precisely. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by a code word from the ground controller or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of ''Y-Ger\u00e4t'' was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.<ref name=\"Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328\"/><ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 89.\"/>\n\n===British countermeasures===\nIn June 1940, a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the ''Knickebein'', even though it was under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. [[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]], who started a search which discovered that ''Luftwaffe'' Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; [[Avro Anson]]s of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30&nbsp;MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to [[Derby]] (which had been mentioned in ''Luftwaffe'' transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital [[Cauterization#Electrocautery|electrocautery]] machines.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389\">Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389.</ref> The counter-operations were carried out by British [[Electronic Counter Measures]] (ECM) units under Wing Commander [[Edward Addison]], [[No. 80 Wing RAF]]. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as [[meaconing]] using masking beacons ({{not a typo|meacons}}).{{sfn|Hooton|2010|p=84}} Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened their paths, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets; confidence in the device was diminished by the time the ''Luftwaffe'' was ready to conduct big raids.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389\"/>\n\nGerman beacons operated on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which enabled the ''Luftwaffe'' crews to determine the signal's bearing. The meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\">Mackay 2003, p. 91.</ref> In general, German bombers were likely to get through to their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night-fighter force would be ready, and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]] only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary (\"Starfish\") targets.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\"/>\n\nFor industrial areas, fires and lighting were simulated. It was decided to recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, [[carbon arc]] lamps were used to simulate the flash of [[tram]] cables. Red lamps were used to simulate [[blast furnace]]s and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden panels.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\"/> The use of diversionary techniques such as fires had to be made carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were similar to those of the German C-250 and C-500 ''Flammbomben''. The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real target.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\"/>\n\n==First phase==\n\n===''Loge'' and ''Seeschlange''===\n[[File:London Blitz 791940.jpg|thumb|Smoke rising from fires in the London docks, following bombing on 7 September]]\n\nThe first deliberate air raids on London were mainly aimed at the [[Port of London]], causing severe damage.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 35.\"/> Late in the afternoon of 7 September 1940, the Germans began Operation London (''Unternehmen Loge'') (the codename for London) and ''Seeschlange'' (Sea Snake), the air offensives against London and other industrial cities. ''Loge'' continued for 57 nights.<ref name=\"Bungay 2000, p. 313.\">Bungay 2000, p. 313.</ref> A total of 348 bombers and 617 fighters took part in the attack.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 309.</ref><ref>Shores 1985, p. 52.</ref>\n\nInitially the change in strategy caught the RAF off-guard and caused extensive damage and civilian casualties. Some 107,400 gross tons of shipping was damaged in the [[Thames Estuary]] and 1,600 civilians were casualties.<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 26.</ref> Of this total around 400 were killed.<ref>Stansky 2007, p. 95.</ref> The fighting in the air was more intense in daylight. ''Loge'' had cost the ''Luftwaffe'' 41 aircraft; 14 bombers, 16 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s, seven [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s and four reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 310.</ref> Fighter Command lost 23 fighters, with six pilots killed and another seven wounded.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 311.</ref> Another 247 bombers from ''Luftflotte'' 3 (Air Fleet 3) attacked that night.<ref>Collier 1980, p. 178.</ref> On 8 September the ''Luftwaffe'' returned; 412 people were killed and 747 severely wounded.<ref name=\"Bungay 2000, p. 313.\"/>\n\nOn 9 September the ''OKL'' appeared to be backing two strategies. Its round-the-clock bombing of London was an immediate attempt to force the British government to capitulate, but it was also striking at Britain's vital sea communications to achieve a victory through siege. Although the weather was poor, heavy raids took place that afternoon on the London suburbs and the airfield at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]]. The day's fighting cost Kesselring and ''[[Luftflotte 2]]'' (Air Fleet 2) 24 aircraft, including 13 Bf 109s. Fighter Command lost 17 fighters and six pilots. Over the next few days weather was poor and the next main effort would not be made until 15 September 1940.<ref name=\"Bungay 2000, p. 313.\"/>\n\nOn 15 September the ''Luftwaffe'' made two large daylight attacks on London along the Thames Estuary, targeting the docks and rail communications in the city. Its hope was to destroy its targets and draw the RAF into defending them, allowing the ''Luftwaffe'' to destroy their fighters in large numbers, thereby achieving an air superiority.<ref name=\"Price 1990, p. 12\"/> Large air battles broke out, lasting for most of the day. The first attack merely damaged the rail network for three days,<ref>Goss 2000, p. 154.</ref> and the second attack failed altogether.<ref>Price 1990, pp. 93\u2013104.</ref> The air battle was later commemorated by Battle of Britain Day. The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 18 percent of the bombers sent on the operations that day, and failed to gain air superiority.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 80.\">Hooton 2010, p. 80.</ref>\n\nWhile G\u00f6ring was optimistic the ''Luftwaffe'' could prevail, Hitler was not. On 17 September he postponed Operation Sea Lion (as it turned out, indefinitely) rather than gamble Germany's newly gained military prestige on a risky cross-Channel operation, particularly in the face of a sceptical [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union. In the last days of the battle, the bombers became lures in an attempt to draw the RAF into combat with German fighters. But their operations were to no avail; the worsening weather and unsustainable attrition in daylight gave the ''OKL'' an excuse to switch to night attacks on 7 October.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 80.\"/><ref>Shores 1985, p. 55.</ref><ref>McKee 1989, p. 286.</ref>\n\n[[File:Birmingham Blitz D 4126.jpg|thumb|Bomb damage to a street [[Birmingham Blitz|in Birmingham]] after an air raid]]\n\nOn 14 October, the heaviest night attack to date saw 380 German bombers from ''Luftflotte'' 3 hit London. Around 200 people were killed and another 2,000 injured. British anti-aircraft defences (General [[Frederick Alfred Pile]]) fired 8,326 rounds and shot down only two bombers. On 15 October, the bombers returned and about 900 fires were started by the mix of {{convert|415|ST|t|abbr=on}} of [[high explosive]] and {{convert|11|ST|t|abbr=on}} of [[Incendiary device#Development and use in World War II|incendiaries]] dropped. Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock damaged.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 131.</ref>\n\n''Loge'' continued during October. {{convert|9000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped that month, about 10 percent in daylight, over {{convert|6000|ST|t|abbr=on}} on London during the night. Birmingham and Coventry were subject to {{convert|500|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs between them in the last 10 days of October. Liverpool suffered {{convert|200|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs dropped. Hull and [[Glasgow]] were attacked but {{convert|800|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were spread out all over Britain. The [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] works in [[Manchester]] was hit by {{convert|12|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs. Little tonnage was dropped on Fighter Command airfields; Bomber Command airfields were hit instead.<ref>James and Cox 2000, p. 307.</ref>\n\n[[File:Blitzaftermath.jpg|thumb|left|Firefighters tackling a blaze amongst ruined buildings after an air raid on London]]\n\n''Luftwaffe'' policy at this point was primarily to continue progressive attacks on London, chiefly by night attack; second, to interfere with production in the vast industrial arms factories of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], again chiefly by night attack; and third to disrupt plants and factories during the day by means of fighter-bombers.<ref>James and Cox 2000, p. 308.</ref>\n\nKesselring, commanding ''Luftflotte'' 2, was ordered to send 50 sorties per night against London and attack eastern harbours in daylight. Sperrle, commanding ''Luftflotte'' 3, was ordered to dispatch 250 sorties per night including 100 against the West Midlands. ''Seeschlange'' would be carried out by [[10th Air Corps (Germany)|''Fliegerkorps'' X]] (10th Air Corps) which concentrated on mining operations against shipping. It also took part in the bombing over Britain. By 19/20 April 1941, it had dropped 3,984 mines, {{frac|1|3}} of the total dropped. The mines' ability to destroy entire streets earned them respect in Britain, but several fell unexploded into British hands allowing counter-measures to be developed which damaged the German anti-shipping campaign.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 34.\"/>\n\nBy mid-November 1940, when the Germans adopted a changed plan, more than {{convert|13000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London. Outside the capital, there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft, as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool, but no major raids. The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding, and much damage had been done to the railway system outside. In September, there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain, and at one period, between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs. But the great bulk of the traffic went on; and Londoners\u2014though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station, or made strange detours round back streets in the buses\u2014still got to work. For all the destruction of life and property, the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale. More than 13,000 civilians had been killed, and almost 20,000 injured, in September and October alone,<ref>Richards 1954, p. 206.</ref> but the death toll was much less than expected. In late 1940, Churchill credited the shelters.<ref>''Knickerbocker'', 1941, pp. 372\u2013373<!--how do you cite a source without author, publisher, & city, exactly?!--></ref>\n\nWartime observers perceived the bombing as indiscriminate. American observer [[Ralph Ingersoll (PM publisher)|Ralph Ingersoll]] reported the bombing was inaccurate and did not hit targets of military value, but destroyed the surrounding areas. Ingersol wrote that [[Battersea Power Station]], one of the largest landmarks in London, received only a minor hit.<ref>Ingersoll, 1940, pp. 79\u201380, 174</ref> In fact, on 8 September 1940 both Battersea and [[West Ham Power Station]] were both shut down after the 7 September daylight attack on London.<ref>Ray 2004, p. 125.</ref> In the case of Battersea power station, an unused extension was hit and destroyed during November but the station was not put out of action during the night attacks.<ref>Ramsay 1988, p. 280.</ref> It is not clear whether the power station or any specific structure was targeted during the German offensive as the ''Luftwaffe'' could not accurately bomb select targets during night operations.<ref name=\"Sansom 1990, p. 28.\">Sansom 1990, p. 28.</ref> In the initial operations against London, it did appear as if rail targets and the [[List of crossings of the River Thames|bridges over the Thames]] had been singled out: [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] was hit by four bombs and suffered extensive damage.<ref name=\"Sansom 1990, p. 28.\" /> The bombing disrupted rail traffic through London without destroying any of the crossings.<ref>Sansom 1990, p. 162.</ref> On 7 November, [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]], [[Kensal Green station|Kensal]] and [[Bricklayers Arms railway station|Bricklayers Arms]] stations were hit and several lines of [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Rail]] were cut on 10 November.

Ground-based [[radar]] was limited, and airborne radar and RAF night fighters were generally ineffective.<ref>Price 1990, p. 20.</ref> RAF day fighters were converting to night operations and the interim [[Bristol Blenheim]] night fighter conversion of the light bomber was being replaced by the powerful [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], but this was only available in very small numbers.<ref name=\"Shores 1985, p. 57.\"/> By the second month of the Blitz the defences were not performing well.<ref>Dobinson 2001, p. 252.</ref> London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]]. The difference this made to the effectiveness of air defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy [[anti-aircraft artillery]] AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]]; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type.<ref>Taylor 1969, p. 326.</ref> AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 193.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hendon 190913 Boulton Paul Defiant 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boulton Paul Defiant]] night fighter ''N1671'']]\n\n[[Airborne Interception radar]] (AI) was unreliable. The heavy fighting in the Battle of Britain had eaten up most of Fighter Command's resources, so there was little investment in night fighting. Bombers were flown with [[Turbinlite|airborne search lights]] out of desperation but to little avail. Of greater potential was the GL (Gunlaying) radar and searchlights with fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led Interception) under Group-level control ([[No. 10 Group RAF]], [[No. 11 Group RAF]] and [[No. 12 Group RAF]]).<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 32.\">Hooton 1997, p. 32.</ref> [[Whitehall]]'s disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]] on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67 per cent of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43 per cent of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61 percent of the combats. Yet when compared with ''Luftwaffe'' daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to one per cent. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance of evading it.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 32.\"/>\n\nNevertheless, it was radar that proved to be the critical weapon in the night battles over Britain from this point onward. Dowding had introduced the concept of airborne radar and encouraged its usage. Eventually it would become a success. On the night of 22/23 July 1940, [[Flying Officer]] Cyril Ashfield (pilot), [[Pilot Officer]] Geoffrey Morris (Observer) and [[Flight Sergeant]] Reginald Leyland (Air Intercept radar operator) of the [[Fighter Interception Unit]] became the first pilot and crew to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft using on-board radar to guide them to a visual interception, when their AI night fighter brought down a Do 17 off Sussex.<ref>White 2007, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> On 19 November 1940 the famous RAF night fighter ace [[John Cunningham (RAF officer)|John Cunningham]] shot down a Ju 88 bomber using airborne radar, just as Dowding had predicted.<ref>Holland 2007, pp. 602\u2013603.</ref> By mid-November, nine squadrons were available, but only one was equipped with Beaufighters ([[No. 219 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Kenley]]). By 16 February 1941, this had grown to 12; with five equipped, or partially equipped with Beaufighters spread over five Groups.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 189.</ref>\n\n==Second phase==\n\n===Night attacks===\n[[File:Coventry bomb damage H5600.jpg|thumb|[[Coventry]] city centre following [[Coventry Blitz|14/15 November 1940 raid]]]]\n\nFrom November 1940 to February 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' shifted its strategy and attacked other industrial cities.<ref>Cooper 1981, p. 170.</ref> In particular, the West Midlands were targeted. On the night of 13/14 November, 77 He 111s of [[Kampfgeschwader 26|''Kampfgeschwader'' 26]] (26th Bomber Wing, or KG 26) bombed London while 63 from [[Kampfgeschwader 55|KG 55]] hit Birmingham.

Only one bomber was lost, to anti-aircraft fire, despite the RAF flying 125 night sorties. No follow up raids were made, as ''OKL'' underestimated the British power of recovery (as Bomber Command would do over Germany from 1943\u20131945).<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 35\"/> The Germans were surprised by the success of the attack. The concentration had been achieved by accident.<ref>Price 1977, pp. 43\u201345.</ref> The strategic effect of the raid was a brief 20 percent dip in aircraft production.<ref name=\"Cooper 1981, p. 173.\"/>\n\n[[File:View from St Paul's Cathedral after the Blitz.jpg|thumb|left|View from St. Paul's Cathedral after the Blitz]]\n\nFive nights later, Birmingham was hit by 369 bombers from [[Kampfgeschwader 54|KG 54]], KG&nbsp;26, and KG&nbsp;55. By the end of November, 1,100 bombers were available for night raids. An average of 200 were able to strike per night. This weight of attack went on for two months, with the ''Luftwaffe'' dropping {{convert|13900|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs.<ref name=\"Shores 1985, p. 57.\"/> In November 1940, 6,000 sorties and 23 major attacks (more than 100 tons of bombs dropped) were flown. Two heavy ({{convert|50|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs) attacks were also flown. In December, only 11 major and five heavy attacks were made.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 87.\">Hooton 2010, p. 87.</ref>\n\nProbably the most devastating attack occurred on the evening of 29 December, when German aircraft attacked the [[City of London]] itself with [[Firebombing|incendiary]] and high explosive bombs, causing a firestorm that has been called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 36.</ref> The first group to use these incendiaries was ''Kampfgruppe'' 100 which despatched 10 \"pathfinder\" He 111s.

The ''Luftwaffe'' had dropped {{convert|18291|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs.<ref>Stansky 2007, p. 180.</ref>\n\nNot all of the ''Luftwaffe'' effort was made against inland cities. Port cities were also attacked to try to disrupt trade and sea communications. In January, Swansea was bombed four times, very heavily. On 17 January around 100 bombers dropped a high concentration of incendiaries, some 32,000 in all. The main damage was inflicted on the commercial and domestic areas. Four days later 230 tons was dropped including 60,000 incendiaries. In Portsmouth [[Southsea]] and [[Gosport]] waves of 150 bombers destroyed vast swaths of the city with 40,000 incendiaries. Warehouses, rail lines and houses were destroyed and damaged, but the docks were largely untouched.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 185.</ref> In January and February 1941, ''Luftwaffe'' serviceability rates declined, until just 551 of 1,214 bombers were combat worthy. Seven major and eight heavy attacks were flown, but the weather made it difficult to keep up the pressure. Still, at [[Southampton]], attacks were so effective morale did give way briefly with civilian authorities leading people ''en masse'' out of the city.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 87.\"/>\n\n===Strategic or \"terror\" bombing===\n{{See also|Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u20131945)#Organization of the Luftwaffe|l1=Organization of the Luftwaffe}}\n[[File:WWII London Blitz East London.jpg|thumb|Children in the [[East End of London]], made homeless by the Blitz]]\n\nAlthough official German air doctrine did target civilian morale, it did not espouse the attacking of civilians directly. It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories and public utilities as well as its food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant the target area needed to be illuminated and hit \"without regard for the civilian population\".<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 34.\">Hooton 1997, p. 34.</ref> Special units, such as ''KGr'' 100, became the ''Beleuchtergruppe'' (Firelighter Group), which used incendiaries and high explosive to mark the target area. The tactic was expanded into ''Feuerleitung'' (Blaze Control) with the creation of ''Brandbombenfelder'' (Incendiary Fields) to mark targets. These were marked out by parachute flares. Then bombers carrying [[SC1000 bomb|SC&nbsp;1000]] ({{convert|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}), SC&nbsp;1400 ({{convert|1400|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}), and SC&nbsp;1800 ({{convert|1800|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}) \"Satan\" bombs were used to level streets and residential areas. By December, the SC&nbsp;2500 ({{convert|2500|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}) \"Max\" bomb was used.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 34.\"/>\n\nThese decisions, apparently taken at the ''Luftflotte'' or ''Fliegerkorps'' level, meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was, for all intents and purposes, an unrestricted area attack or ''Terrorangriff'' (Terror Attack).<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\">Hooton 2010, p. 85.</ref> Part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation. The effectiveness of British countermeasures against ''Knickebein'', which was designed to avoid area attacks, forced the ''Luftwaffe'' to resort to these methods.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/> The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped. ''KGr'' 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13\u201328 percent. By December, this had increased to 92 percent.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/> Use of incendiaries, which were inherently inaccurate, indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites. Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/> Captured German air crews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/>\n\n==Final attacks==\n\n===Directive 23: G\u00f6ring and the ''Kriegsmarine''===\n{{See also|List of Adolf Hitler's directives#Directive 23|l1=Directive 23}}\n\nIn 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' shifted strategy again. [[Erich Raeder]]\u2014commander-in-chief of the ''Kriegsmarine''\u2014had long argued the ''Luftwaffe'' should support the German submarine force (''U-Bootwaffe'') in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by attacking shipping in the Atlantic Ocean and attacking British ports.<ref>Raeder 2001, p. 322.</ref> Eventually, he convinced Hitler of the need to attack British port facilities.<ref>Over 1980, p. 36.</ref> At Raeder's prompting, Hitler correctly noted that the greatest damage to the British war economy had been done through the destruction of merchant shipping by submarines and air attacks by small numbers of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] naval aircraft and ordered the German air arm to focus its efforts against British convoys. This meant that British coastal centres and shipping at sea west of Ireland were the prime targets.<ref>Isby 2005, p. 110.</ref>\n\nHitler's interest in this strategy forced G\u00f6ring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to G\u00f6ring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, ''Directions for operations against the British War Economy'', which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\">Hooton 2010, p. 88.</ref> This strategy had been recognised before the war, but [[Operation Eagle Attack]] and the following Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 195.</ref> The ''OKL'' had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries.<ref>Isby 2005, p. 109.</ref>\n\nDirective 23 was the only concession made by G\u00f6ring to the ''Kriegsmarine'' over the strategic bombing strategy of the ''Luftwaffe'' against Britain. Thereafter, he would refuse to make available any air units to destroy British dockyards, ports, port facilities, or shipping in dock or at sea, lest ''Kriegsmarine'' gain control of more ''Luftwaffe'' units.<ref>Overy 1980, p. 37.</ref> Raeder's successor\u2014[[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\u2014would\u2014on the intervention of Hitler\u2014gain control of one unit ([[Kampfgeschwader 40|KG 40]]), but G\u00f6ring would soon regain it. G\u00f6ring's lack of co-operation was detrimental to the one air strategy with potentially decisive strategic effect on Britain. Instead, he wasted aircraft of ''[[Fliegerf\u00fchrer Atlantik]]'' (Flying Command Atlantic) on bombing mainland Britain instead of attacks against convoys.<ref>Murray 1983, p. 136.</ref> For G\u00f6ring, his prestige had been damaged by the defeat in the Battle of Britain, and he wanted to regain it by subduing Britain by air power alone. He was always reluctant to co-operate with Raeder.<ref>Murray 1983, p. 135.</ref>\n\nEven so, the decision by the ''OKL'' to support the strategy in Directive 23 was instigated by two considerations, both of which had little to do with wanting to destroy Britain's sea communications in conjunction with the ''Kriegsmarine''. First, the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break led the ''OKL'' to adopt the naval option.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/> The indifference displayed by the ''OKL'' to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure, or diverting strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives. Other targets would be considered if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather conditions.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/>\n\nA further line in the directive stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible, but also to intensify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941. However, meteorological conditions over Britain<!--when? Winter '40?--> were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations. Airfields became water-logged and the 18 ''Kampfgruppen'' (bomber groups) of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s ''[[Kampfgeschwader]]n'' (bomber wings) were relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/>\n\n===British ports===\nFrom the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The ''Luftwaffe'' flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the ''Luftwaffe'' flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-''Ger\u00e4t'' beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-''Ger\u00e4t'', whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-''Ger\u00e4t''.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/>\n\nBy now, the imminent threat of invasion had all but passed as the ''Luftwaffe'' had failed to gain the prerequisite air superiority. The aerial bombing was now principally aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but also continued with the objective of breaking the morale of the civilian population.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=52}} The attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven ''Kampfgruppen'' moved to Austria in preparation for the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]]. The shortage of bombers caused ''OKL'' to improvise.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/> Some 50 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers and ''Jabos'' (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as ''Leichte Kampfflugzeuge'' (\"light bombers\") and sometimes called ''Leichte Kesselringe'' (\"Light Kesselrings\"). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, only one-third of German bombs hit their targets.<ref>Hooton 2010, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n[[File:Liverpool Blitz D 5984.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Liverpool city centre after heavy bombing]]\n\nThe diversion of heavier bombers to the Balkans meant that the crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of [[Kampfgeschwader 30|KG 30]] was flying on his 50th mission. He fell asleep at the controls of his Ju 88 and woke up to discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and Dextro-Energen tablets, then completed the mission.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\">Hooton 1997, p. 37.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' could still inflict much damage and after the German conquest of Western Europe, the air and submarine offensive against British sea communications became much more dangerous than the German offensive during the First World War. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the [[Western Approaches]] from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the country.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 205.</ref> Air attacks sank {{convert|39126|LT|t|abbr=on}} of shipping, with another {{convert|111601|LT|t|abbr=on}} damaged. Minister of Home Security [[Herbert Morrison]] was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\"/> Other sources point out that half of the 144 berths in the port were rendered unusable and cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75 percent. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged, amounting to {{convert|80000|LT|t|abbr=on}}. Around 66,000 houses were destroyed and 77,000 people made homeless (\"bombed out\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Black Saturday|last=Schwarz|first=Benjamin|date=April 2008|work=The Atlantic|access-date=|page=85}}</ref>), with 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one night.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 207.</ref> Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale. The populace of the port of Hull became \"trekkers\", people who made a mass exodus from cities before, during and after attacks.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\"/> The ''Luftwaffe'' attacks failed to knock out railways or port facilities for long, even in the Port of London, a target of many attacks.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 35.\" /> The Port of London in particular was an important target, bringing in one-third of overseas trade.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 16.</ref>\n\nOn 13 March, the upper [[River Clyde|Clyde]] port of [[Clydebank]] near Glasgow was bombed ([[Clydebank Blitz]]). All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many more ports were attacked. [[Plymouth]] was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and [[Cardiff]] were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, [[Portsmouth]] centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people.<ref name=\"Calder 2003, p. 37.\">Calder 2003, p. 37.</ref> Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth.<ref name=\"Cooper 1981, p. 174.\"/><ref>Calder 2003, p. 119.</ref> Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged, the electrical supply was knocked out, and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs, including 160 tons of high explosive and 32,000 incendiaries. Much of the city centre was destroyed. Damage was inflicted on the port installations, but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April 346 tons of explosives and 46,000 incendiaries were dropped from 250 bombers led by ''KG'' 26. The damage was considerable, and the Germans also used aerial mines. Over 2,000 AAA shells were fired, destroying two Ju 88s.<ref>Ray 1996, pp. 215, 217.</ref> By the end of the air campaign over Britain, only eight percent of the German effort against British ports was made using mines.<ref>Neitzel 2003, p. 453.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Second World War 1939 - 1945- the Home Front HU1129.jpg|thumb|Firefighters at work amongst burning buildings, during the large raid of 10/11 May]]\n\nIn the north, substantial efforts were made against [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which were large ports on the English east coast. On 9 April 1941 ''Luftflotte 2'' dropped 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries from 120 bombers in a five-hour attack. Sewer, rail, docklands, and electric installations were damaged. In Sunderland on 25 April, ''Luftflotte 2'' sent 60 bombers which dropped 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries. Much damage was done. A further attack on the Clyde, this time at [[Greenock Blitz|Greenock]], took place on 6 and 7 May. However, as with the attacks in the south, the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple industry in the regions.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe last major attack on London was on 10/11 May 1941, on which the ''Luftwaffe'' flew 571 sorties and dropped 800 tonnes of bombs. This caused more than 2,000 fires; 1,436 people were killed and 1,792 seriously injured, which affected morale badly.<ref name=\"Calder 2003, p. 37.\"/> Another raid was carried out on 11/12 May 1941.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\"/> [[Westminster Abbey]] and the Law Courts were damaged, while the Chamber of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] was destroyed. One-third of London's streets were impassable. All but one railway station line was blocked for several weeks.<ref name=\"Calder 2003, p. 37.\"/> This raid was significant, as 63 German fighters were sent with the bombers, indicating the growing effectiveness of RAF night fighter defences.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\"/>\n\n===RAF night fighters===\nGerman [[air supremacy]] at night was also now under threat. British night-fighter operations out over the Channel were proving successful.<ref>Faber 1977, p. 205.</ref> This was not immediately apparent.<ref>Mackay 2003, p. 88.</ref> The [[Bristol Blenheim]] F.1 carried four {{convert|.303|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} machine guns which lacked the firepower to easily shoot down a Do 17, Ju 88 or Heinkel He 111.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 86\u201387.\">Mackay 2003, pp. 86\u201387.</ref> The Blenheim had only a small speed advantage to overhaul a German bomber in a stern-chase. Added to the fact an interception relied on visual sighting, a kill was most unlikely even in the conditions of a moonlit sky.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 86\u201387.\"/> The [[Boulton Paul Defiant]], despite its poor performance during daylight engagements, was a much better night fighter. It was faster, able to catch the bombers and its configuration of four machine guns in a turret could (much like German night fighters in 1943\u20131945 with ''[[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]]'') engage the German bomber from beneath. Attacks from below offered a larger target, compared to attacking tail-on, as well as a better chance of not being seen by the crew (so less chance of evasion), as well as greater likelihood of detonating its bomb load. In subsequent months a steady number of German bombers would fall to night fighters.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 87.\">Mackay 2003, p. 87.</ref>\n\nImproved aircraft designs were in the offing with the Bristol Beaufighter, then under development.

The ''Luftwaffe'' dropped around {{convert|45000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs during the Blitz, which disrupted production and transport, reduced food supplies, and shook British morale. The bombing also helped to support the [[U-boat]] blockade by sinking some {{convert|58000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of shipping and damaging {{convert|450000|LT|t|abbr=on}} more. Despite the bombing, British production rose steadily throughout this period, although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers for Easter Holidays, according to the British official history. The official history volume ''British War Production'' (Postan, 1952) noted that the greatest effect on output of warlike stores was on the supply of components and dispersal of production rather than complete equipments.<ref>Postan, 1952, pp. 164\u2013166</ref><ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 89.\">Hooton 2010, p. 89.</ref>\n\nIn aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of the industry, at first because of damage to aircraft factories and then by a policy of precautionary dispersal.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\"/> In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, [[rifle]] production fell by 25 per cent, filled-shell production by 4.6 per cent and in small-arms production 4.5 per cent.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\"/> The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took from 10\u201315 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer. The attacks against Birmingham took war industries some three months to recover fully. The exhausted population took three weeks to overcome the effects of an attack.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\"/>\n\nThe air offensive against the RAF and British industry failed to have the desired effect. More might have been achieved had ''OKL'' exploited the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber Command attacked rail communications and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] targeted oil, but that would have required an economic-industrial analysis of which the ''Luftwaffe'' was incapable.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 89.\"/> ''OKL'' instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently), and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than strategy.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 90.\">Hooton 2010, p. 90.</ref> Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz cost around 41,000 lives, may have injured another 139,000 people, and did enormous damage to British infrastructure and housing stock.<ref name=\"Foot and Dear 2005, p. 109.\"/>\n\n===RAF evaluation===\nThe British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941 and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries, because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the ''Luftwaffe'' had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 90.\"/>\n[[File:A British airman is amongst a group of civilians crowded around the window of a shop in Holborn, London, to look at a map illustrating how the RAF is striking back at Germany during 1940. D1254.jpg|thumb|People in London look at a map illustrating how the RAF is striking back at Germany during 1940]]\nSome writers claim the Air Staff ignored a critical lesson, that British morale did not break and that attacking German morale was not sufficient to induce a collapse. Aviation strategists dispute that morale was ever a major consideration for Bomber Command. Throughout 1933\u201339 none of the 16 Western Air Plans drafted mentioned morale as a target. The first three directives in 1940 did not mention civilian populations or morale in any way. Morale was not mentioned until the ninth wartime directive on 21 September 1940.<ref>Hall 1998, p. 118.</ref> The 10th directive in October 1940 mentioned morale by name but industrial cities were only to be targeted if weather prevented raids on oil targets.<ref>Hall 1998, p. 119.</ref>\n\nThe AOC Bomber Command, [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], who did see German morale as an objective, did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare) and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Battle of Berlin]], Harris declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve \"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable\".<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 411.\" /><ref name=\"Hall\">Hall 1998, p. 120, 137.</ref>\nA summary of Harris' strategic intentions was clear,\n\n{{quote|From 1943 to the end of the war, he [Harris] and other proponents of the area offensive represented it [the bomber offensive] less as an attack on morale than as an assault on the housing, utilities, communications, and other services that supported the war production effort.|Hall<ref name=\"Hall\" />}}\n\nin comparison to the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, casualties due to the Blitz were relatively low; the [[bombing of Hamburg]] alone inflicted about 40,000 civilian casualties.<ref>Tooze, 2006, p. 601</ref>\n\n===Popular imagery and propaganda===\n[[File:Air Raid Damage in London, 1940 HU36206.jpg|thumb|upright|Women salvaging possessions from their bombed house, including plants and a clock]]\n\nA converse popular image arose of British people in the Second World War: a collection of people locked in national solidarity. This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of [[Angus Calder]]'s book ''The Myth of the Blitz'' (1991). It was evoked by both the right and left political factions in Britain during the [[Falklands War]] when it was embedded in a nostalgic narrative in which the Second World War represented aggressive British patriotism successfully defending democracy.<ref name=\"Summerfieldand\">Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 3.</ref><ref>Field 2002, p. 12.</ref> This imagery of people in the Blitz was and is powerfully portrayed in film, radio, newspapers and magazines.<ref>Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 4.</ref> At the time it was a useful propaganda tool for home and foreign consumption.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Historians' critical response to this construction focused on what were seen as over-emphasised claims of righteous nationalism and national unity. In the ''Myth of the Blitz'', Calder exposed some of the counter-evidence of anti-social and divisive behaviours. What he saw as the myth&nbsp;\u2013 serene national unity&nbsp;\u2013 became \"historical truth\". In particular, class division was most evident.<ref name=\"Summerfieldand\" />\n\nRaids during the Blitz produced the greatest divisions and morale effects in the working-class areas. Lack of sleep, insufficient shelters and inefficiency of warning systems were causes. The loss of sleep was a particular factor, with many not bothering to attend inconvenient shelters. The Communist Party made political capital out of these difficulties.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, in particular, took to using the Underground railway system, without authority, for shelter and sleeping through the night. So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the police were sent to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Home Secretary Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards, in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling. Still, many British citizens, who had been members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], itself inert over the issue, turned to the Communist Party. The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace. Though they failed to make a large gain in influence, the membership of the Party had doubled by June 1941.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 83\u201384.</ref> The \"Communist threat\" was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order, with the support of the Cabinet, the stoppage of the ''[[Daily Worker (UK)|Daily Worker]]'' and ''[[The Week]]''; the Communist newspaper and journal.<ref>Calder 2003, p. 88.</ref>\n\nThe brief success of the Communists also fed into the hands of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF). [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitic]] attitudes became widespread, particularly in London. Rumours that Jewish support was underpinning the Communist surge were frequent. Rumours that Jews were inflating prices, were responsible for the [[Black Market]], were the first to panic under attack (even the cause of the panic) and secured the best shelters via underhanded methods, were also widespread. There was also racial antagonism between the small Black, Indian and Jewish communities but there were no race riots despite the mixing of different peoples in confined areas.<!--why is this point made?--><ref>Field 2002, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn other cities, class conflict was more evident. Over a quarter of London's population had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population in south Wales and [[Gloucester]] intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including industry dispersal may have been a factor. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 129\u2013130.</ref> The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88 per cent of evacuated mothers, 86 per cent of small children, and 43 per cent of school children had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\" />\n\n===Archive audio recordings===\nIn recent years a large number of wartime recordings relating to the Blitz have been made available on audiobooks such as ''The Blitz'', ''The Home Front'' and ''British War Broadcasting''. These collections include period interviews with civilians, servicemen, aircrew, politicians and Civil Defence personnel, as well as Blitz actuality recordings, news bulletins and public information broadcasts. Notable interviews include Thomas Alderson, the first recipient of the George Cross, John Cormack, who survived eight days trapped beneath rubble on Clydeside, and Herbert Morrison's famous \"Britain shall not burn\" appeal for more fireguards in December 1940.<ref>Hayward 2007, www.ltmrecordings.com/blitz1notes.html</ref>\n\n===Bombsite rubble===\nIn one 6-month period, 750,000 tons of bombsite rubble from London were transported by railway on 1,700 [[freight train]]s to make runways on Bomber Command airfields in [[East Anglia]]. Bombsite rubble from Birmingham was used to make runways on [[US Air Force]] bases in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] in southeast England.<ref>Nicol, 2010 p. 237</ref> Many sites of bombed buildings, when cleared of rubble, were cultivated to grow vegetables to ease wartime food shortages and were known as [[victory garden]]s.<ref>Way, 2015, p. 59</ref>\n\n==Tables==\n\n===Bombing raid statistics===\nBelow is a table by city of the number of major raids (where at least 100 tons of bombs were dropped) and tonnage of bombs dropped during these major raids.

The term was first used by the British press and is the German word for 'lightning'.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170707085619/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/the_blitz BBC History]</ref>\n\nThe Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns, and cities, beginning with raids on London towards the end of the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940 (a battle for daylight [[air superiority]] between the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and the [[Royal Air Force]] over the United Kingdom). By September 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' had failed and the German air fleets (''[[Luftflotte]]n'') were ordered to attack [[London]], to draw [[RAF Fighter Command]] into a [[battle of annihilation]].<ref name=\"Price 1990, p. 12\">Price 1990, p. 12.</ref><ref>Ray 2009, pp. 104\u2013105.</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] and ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the ''Luftwaffe'', ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940. From 7 September 1940, London was systematically bombed by the ''Luftwaffe'' for 56 of the following 57 days and nights.<ref>Stansky 2007, p. 28.</ref> Most notable was a large daylight attack against London on [[Battle of Britain Day|15 September]].\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of night attacks to evade attack by the RAF, and the Blitz became a night bombing campaign after October 1940. The ''Luftwaffe'' attacked the main [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] sea port of [[Liverpool]] in the [[Liverpool Blitz]]. The [[North Sea]] port of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, suffered the [[Hull Blitz]]. [[Bristol Blitz|Bristol]], [[Cardiff Blitz|Cardiff]], [[Portsmouth Blitz|Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth Blitz|Plymouth]], [[Southampton Blitz|Southampton]] and [[Swansea Blitz|Swansea]] were also bombed, as were the industrial cities of [[Birmingham Blitz|Birmingham]], [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast]], [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry]], [[Glasgow Blitz|Glasgow]], [[Manchester Blitz|Manchester]] and [[Sheffield Blitz|Sheffield]]. More than 40,000&nbsp;civilians were killed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing during the war, almost half of them in the capital, where more than a million houses were destroyed or damaged.<ref name=\"Richards 1954, p. 217.\">Richards 1954, p. 217.</ref>\n\nIn early July 1940, the German High Command began planning [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union.<ref>Bungay, Stephen (2000).

The bombing effort was diluted by attacks against several sets of industries instead of constant pressure on the most vital.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\" /><ref>Overy 1980, pp. 34, 36.</ref><!--needs a bit about Br success too-->\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Luftwaffe'' and strategic bombing===\n{{Main|Strategic bombing}}\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, [[airpower]] theorists such as [[Giulio Douhet]] and [[Billy Mitchell]] claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating the need for land and sea combat.<ref>Cox and Gray 2002, p. xvii.</ref> It was thought that [[the bomber will always get through|bombers would always get through]] and could not be resisted, particularly at night. Industry, seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the means to make war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale and a loss of production in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The [[RAF]] and the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of [[RAF Bomber Command]] became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.<ref>Montgomery-Hyde 1976, p.&nbsp;137.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' took a cautious view of strategic bombing and ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe|OKL]]'' did not oppose the strategic bombardment of industries or cities. It believed it could greatly affect the balance of power on the battlefield by disrupting production and damaging civilian morale. ''OKL'' did not believe air power alone could be decisive and the ''Luftwaffe'' did not have a policy of systematic \"terror bombing\". (The ''Luftwaffe'' did not adopt an official policy of the deliberate bombing of civilians until 1942.)<ref>Corum 1997, p. 7.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The vital industries and transport centres that would be targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. It could be claimed civilians were not to be targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as \"terror bombing\", the concept of attacking vital war industries\u2014and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale\u2014was ruled as acceptable.<ref>Corum 1997, p.&nbsp;240</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1941, Walther Wever.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Walter Wever]]\nFrom the beginning of the [[National Socialist]] regime until 1939, there was a debate in German military journals over the role of strategic bombardment, with some contributors arguing along the lines of the British and Americans.<ref>Corum 1997, pp. 238\u2013241.</ref> General [[Walter Wever (General)|Walter Wever]] (Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff\n1 March 1935 \u2013 3 June 1936) championed strategic bombing and the building of suitable aircraft, although he emphasised the importance of aviation in operational and tactical terms. Wever outlined five points of air strategy:\n# To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories and defeat enemy air forces attacking German targets.\n# To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas, by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces\n# To support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e., armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground operations.\n# To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting German naval bases and participating directly in naval battles\n# To paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in armaments factories.<ref>Corum 1997, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\nWever argued that ''OKL'' should not be solely educated in tactical and operational matters but also in grand strategy, war economics, armament production and the mentality of potential opponents (also known as [[Cognitive traps for intelligence analysis#Types|mirror imaging]]). Wever's vision was not realised, staff studies in those subjects fell by the wayside and the Air Academies focused on tactics, technology and operational planning, rather than on independent strategic air offensives.<ref>Corum 1997, p. 252.</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Wever was killed in an air crash and the failure to implement his vision for the new ''Luftwaffe'' was largely attributable to his successors. Ex-Army personnel and his successors as Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff, [[Albert Kesselring]] (3 June 1936 \u2013 31 May 1937) and [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Stumpff]] (1 June 1937 \u2013 31 January 1939) are usually blamed for abandoning strategic planning for [[close air support]]. Two prominent enthusiasts for ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were [[Hugo Sperrle]] the commander of ''[[Luftflotte 3]]'' (1 February 1939 \u2013 23 August 1944) and [[Hans Jeschonnek]] (Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff from 1 February 1939 \u2013 19 August 1943). The ''Luftwaffe'' was not pressed into ground support operations because of pressure from the army or because it was led by ex-soldiers, the ''Luftwaffe'' favoured a model of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns.<ref>Corum 1997, p. 248.</ref>\n\n===Hitler, G\u00f6ring and air power===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-504, Berlin, Adolf Hitler und Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|Hitler and G\u00f6ring, March 1938]]\n\nHitler paid less attention to the bombing of opponents than air defence, although he promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood it was possible to use bombers for strategic purposes. He told ''OKL'' in 1939, that ruthless employment of the ''Luftwaffe'' against the heart of the British will to resist would follow when the moment was right. Hitler quickly developed scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz. He frequently complained of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, \"The munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids&nbsp;... usually the prescribed targets are not hit\".<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 410.\">Overy July 1980, p. 410.</ref>\n\nWhile the war was being planned, Hitler never insisted upon the ''Luftwaffe'' planning a strategic bombing campaign and did not even give ample warning to the air staff, that war with Britain or even Russia was a possibility. The amount of firm operational and tactical preparation for a bombing campaign was minimal, largely because of the failure by Hitler as supreme commander to insist upon such a commitment.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 410.\"/>\n\nUltimately, Hitler was trapped within his own vision of bombing as a terror weapon, formed in the 1930s when he threatened smaller nations into accepting German rule rather than submit to air bombardment.<!--mention the use of air power in the Spanish Civil War?--><!--That seems OT to me.--> This fact had important implications. It showed the extent to which Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of [[economic warfare]], with the collapse of morale as an additional bonus.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 411.\">Overy July 1980, p.&nbsp;411.</ref> Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. As the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German retaliation would persuade the Allies to adopt a policy of moderation and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was&nbsp;\u2013 for reasons of political prestige within Germany itself&nbsp;\u2013 that the German population would be protected from the Allied bombings. When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and he redoubled efforts to mount a similar \"terror offensive\" against Britain in order to produce a stalemate in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 411.\"/>\n\nA major problem in the managing of the ''Luftwaffe'' was G\u00f6ring; Hitler believed the ''Luftwaffe'' was \"the most effective strategic weapon\", and in reply to repeated requests from the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for control over aircraft insisted, \"We should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided ''Luftwaffe''.\"<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 407.\">Overy July 1980, p. 407.</ref> Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in G\u00f6ring a jealous and damaging defence of his \"empire\" while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the ''Luftwaffe'' at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and G\u00f6ring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over.<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 407.\"/> In 1940 and 1941, G\u00f6ring's refusal to co-operate with the ''Kriegsmarine'' denied the entire ''Wehrmacht'' military forces of the ''Reich'' the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the British Empire.<ref>Corum 1997, p.&nbsp;280.</ref>\n\nThe deliberate separation of the ''Luftwaffe'' from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major \"communications gap\" between Hitler and the ''Luftwaffe'', which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, G\u00f6ring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When G\u00f6ring decided against continuing Wever's [[Ural bomber|original heavy bomber]] programme in 1937, the ''Reichsmarschall's'' own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, G\u00f6ring arranged a display of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s most advanced equipment at [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Rechlin]], to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 408.\">Overy July 1980, p.&nbsp;408.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Britain===\n{{Main|Battle of Britain|Adlertag|The Hardest Day|Battle of Britain Day}}\n[[File:Pilots of No. 310 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF in front of Hawker Hurricane Mk I at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, 7 September 1940. CH1299.jpg|thumb|RAF pilots with one of their [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, October 1940]]\n\nAlthough not specifically prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the ''Luftwaffe'' was expected to do so over Britain. From July until September 1940 the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked Fighter Command to gain air superiority as a prelude to invasion. This involved the bombing of [[English Channel]] convoys, ports, and RAF airfields and supporting industries. Destroying RAF Fighter Command would allow the Germans to gain control of the skies over the invasion area. It was supposed Bomber Command, [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]], and the [[Royal Navy]] could not operate under conditions of German air superiority.<ref>McKee 1989, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'''s poor intelligence meant that their aircraft were not always able to locate their targets, and thus attacks on factories and airfields failed to achieve the desired results. British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany's by 2 to 1.<ref>Faber 1977, p. 203.</ref> The British produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany's 8,000.<ref>McKee 1989, p. 294.</ref> The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and ''Luftwaffe'' struggled to replace manpower losses, though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The circumstances affected the Germans more than the British. Operating over home territory, British aircrew could fly again if they survived being shot down. German crews, even if they survived, faced capture. Moreover, bombers had four to five crewmen on board, representing a greater loss of manpower.<ref>Faber 1977, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from the destruction of the RAF's supporting structures. German intelligence suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and an attack on London would force it into a final battle of annihilation while compelling the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1940\u20131945)|British Government]] to surrender.<ref>Price 1990, p. 12; McKee 1989, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe decision to change strategy is sometimes claimed as a major mistake by ''OKL''. It is argued that persisting with attacks on RAF airfields might have won air superiority for the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Wood and Dempster 2003, pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> Others argue that the ''Luftwaffe'' made little impression on Fighter Command in the last week of August and first week of September and that the shift in strategy was not decisive.<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 368\u2013369.</ref> It has also been argued that it was doubtful the ''Luftwaffe'' could have won air superiority before the \"weather window\" began to deteriorate in October.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 80.\"/><ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 283.\">Corum 1997, p. 283.</ref> It was also possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could pull out to the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again.<ref name=\"Corum 1997, p. 283.\"/> Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the ''Kriegsmarine'' would have made the projected German invasion, [[Operation Sea Lion|Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we]] (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or without German air superiority.<ref>Corum 1997, pp. 283\u2013284; Murray 1983, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Change in strategy===\nRegardless of the ability of the ''Luftwaffe'' to win air superiority, Hitler was frustrated it was not happening quickly enough. With no sign of the RAF weakening and the ''Luftflotten'' suffering many losses, ''OKL'' was keen for a change in strategy. To reduce losses further, strategy changed to prefer night raids, giving the bombers greater protection under cover of darkness.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 101.</ref>{{efn|Williamson Murray's ''Strategy for Defeat'' indicated a serious decline in operational readiness. In mid-September, Bf 109 units possessed only 67 per cent of crews against authorised aircraft, Bf 110 units just 46 per cent and bomber units 59 per cent.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=52}}}}\n\nIt was decided to focus on bombing Britain's industrial cities, in daylight to begin with. The main focus was London. The first major raid took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain. Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October, the ''Luftwaffe'' switched its main effort to night attacks. This became official policy on 7 October. The air campaign soon got under way against London and other British cities. However, the ''Luftwaffe'' faced limitations. Its aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dornier Do 17]], [[Junkers Ju 88]], and [[Heinkel He 111]]s&nbsp;\u2013 were capable of carrying out strategic missions<ref>Corum 1997, p. 282.</ref> but were incapable of doing greater damage because of their small bomb-loads.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 35.\">Overy 1980, p. 35.</ref> The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s decision in the interwar period to concentrate on [[medium bomber]]s can be attributed to several reasons: Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939; ''OKL'' believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a [[heavy bomber]] force; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war.<ref>Murray 1983, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAlthough it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the ''Luftwaffe'' had unclear strategy and poor intelligence. ''OKL'' had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938. It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries. Moreover, ''OKL'' could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the ''Luftwaffe'' should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population.<ref>Murray 1983, p. 54; McKee 1989, p. 255.</ref> The ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940\u20131941.<ref>Overy 1980, pp. 34, 37.</ref> Disputes among ''OKL'' staff revolved more around tactics than strategy.<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 38; Hooton 2010, p. 90.</ref> This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 379.</ref>\n\nIn an operational capacity, limitations in weapons technology and quick British reactions were making it more difficult to achieve strategic effect. Attacking ports, shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas, especially the distribution of coal, an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War, would net a positive result. However, the use of [[delayed-action bomb]]s, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate.{{efn|This was caused by moisture ruining the electrical [[fuze]]s. German sources estimated 5\u201310 per cent of bombs failed to explode; the British put the figure at 20 per cent.{{sfn|Hooton|2010|p=84}}}} The British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities, making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack. Regional commissioners were given plenipotentiary powers to restore communications and organise the distribution of supplies to keep the war economy moving.{{sfn|Hooton|2010|p=84}}\n\n==Civil defence==\n\n===Pre-war preparations and fears===\n[[File:Barrage balloons over London during World War II.jpg|thumb|[[Barrage balloon]]s flying over central London]]\n\nLondon had nine million people&nbsp;\u2013 a fifth of the British population&nbsp;\u2013 living in an area of {{convert|750|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3|abbr=off}}, which was difficult to defend because of its size.<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 11.</ref> Based on experience with [[German strategic bombing during World War I]] against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the First World War that 50 casualties&nbsp;\u2013 with about one third killed&nbsp;\u2013 would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the [[Committee on Imperial Defence]] estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1.2 million wounded. News reports of the [[Spanish Civil War]], such as the [[bombing of Barcelona]], supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938, experts generally expected that Germany would try to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high-explosive and [[Incendiary device#Development and use in World War II|incendiary bombs]], the Germans could use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.<ref>Titmuss 1950, pp. 4\u20136,9,12\u201313.</ref> In 1939 military theorist [[Basil Liddell-Hart]] predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\"/> London hospitals prepared for 300,000 casualties in the first week of war.{{r|gunther1940}}\n\nBritish [[air raid siren]]s sounded for the first time 22 minutes after [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|Neville Chamberlain declared war on Germany]].

Many popular works of fiction during the 1920s and 1930s portrayed aerial bombing, such as [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' and its [[Things to Come|1936 film adaptation]], and others such as ''The Air War of 1936'' and ''The Poison War''. [[Harold Macmillan]] wrote in 1956 that he and others around him \"thought of air warfare in 1938 rather as people think of nuclear war today\".<ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 39\u201341.</ref>\n\nBased in part on the experience of German bombing in the First World War, politicians feared mass psychological trauma from aerial attack and the collapse of civil society. In 1938, a committee of psychiatrists predicted three times as many mental as physical casualties from aerial bombing, implying three to four million psychiatric patients.<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 20.</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] told Parliament in 1934, \"We must expect that, under the pressure of continuous attack upon London, at least three or four million people would be driven out into the open country around the metropolis\".<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\"/> Panic during the [[Munich crisis]], such as the migration by 150,000 people to Wales, contributed to fear of social chaos.<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe government planned the [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation]] of four million people&nbsp;\u2013 mostly women and children&nbsp;\u2013 from urban areas, including 1.4 million from London. It expected about 90% of evacuees to stay in private homes, conducted an extensive survey to determine the amount of space available and made detailed preparations for transporting evacuees. A trial [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]] was held on 10 August 1939 and when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September, a blackout began at sunset. Lights were not allowed after dark for almost six years and the blackout became by far the most unpopular aspect of the war for civilians, even more than [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]].<ref>Titmuss 1950, p. 34\u201342, 90, 97.</ref> The relocation of the government and the civil service was also planned but would only have occurred if necessary so as not to damage civilian morale.<ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 51, 106.</ref>\n\nMuch civil-defence preparation in the form of shelters was left in the hands of local authorities and many areas such as [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]], [[Belfast]] and the [[East End of London]] did not have enough shelters.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\">Field 2002, p. 13.</ref> The unexpected delay to civilian bombing during the Phoney War meant that the shelter programme finished in June 1940, before the Blitz.<ref>Mackay 2002, p. 35.</ref> The programme favoured backyard [[Air-raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]] and small brick surface shelters; many of the latter were abandoned in 1940 as unsafe. Authorities expected that the raids would be brief and in daylight, rather than attacks by night, which forced Londoners to sleep in shelters.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 14.\">Field 2002, p. 14.</ref>\n\n===Communal shelters===\n[[File:The Home Front in Britain during the Second World War HU44272.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aldwych tube station]] being used as a bomb shelter in 1940]]\n\nDeep shelters provided most protection against a direct hit. The government did not build them for large populations before the war because of cost, time to build and fears that their safety would cause occupants to refuse to leave to return to work or that anti-war sentiment would develop in large congregations of civilians. The government saw the leading role taken by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] in advocating the building of deep shelters as an attempt to damage civilian morale, especially after the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 14.\"/><ref>Mackay 2002, p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe most important existing communal shelters were the [[London Underground]] stations. Although many civilians had used them for shelter during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids but by the second week of heavy bombing, the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4:00 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940, about 150,000 people a night slept in the Underground, although by winter and spring the numbers declined to 100,000 or less. Battle noises were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations but many people were killed from direct hits on stations.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 15.\">Field 2002, p. 15.</ref> In March 1943, 173 men, women and children were crushed to death at [[Bethnal Green tube station]] in a panic after a woman fell down the steps as she entered the station.<ref>Coates, 1999 p. 19</ref>\n\n[[File:A young woman plays a gramophone in an air raid shelter in north London during 1940.

Authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food. Tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters, to reduce the amount of time spent queuing. Committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments, and organisations such as the [[British Red Cross]] and the [[Salvation Army]] worked to improve conditions. Entertainment included concerts, films, plays and books from local libraries.<ref>Field, 2002, pp. 15\u201320.</ref>\n\nAlthough only a small number of Londoners used the mass shelters, when journalists, celebrities and foreigners visited they became part of the [[Beveridge Report]], part of a national debate on social and class division. Most residents found that such divisions continued within the shelters and many arguments and fights occurred over noise, space and other matters. Anti-Jewish sentiment was reported, particularly around the East End of London, with anti-Semitic graffiti and anti-Semitic rumours, such as that Jewish people were \"hogging\" air raid shelters.<ref>Mackay, 2002, p. 83</ref> Contrary to pre-war fears of anti-Semitic violence in the East End, one observer found that the \"Cockney and the Jew [worked] together, against the [[British Indian|Indian]]\".<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 15-20.\">Field 2002, pp. 15\u201318.</ref>\n\n===\"Blitz Spirit\"===\n\nAlthough the intensity of the bombing was not as great as pre-war expectations so an equal comparison is impossible, no psychiatric crisis occurred because of the Blitz even during the period of greatest bombing of September 1940. An American witness wrote \"By every test and measure I am able to apply, these people are staunch to the bone and won't quit ... the British are stronger and in a better position than they were at its beginning\". People referred to raids as if they were weather, stating that a day was \"very blitzy\".<ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 75, 261</ref>\n\n[[File:Bomb Damage in London during the Second World War HU36157.jpg|thumb|left|Office workers make their way to work through debris after a heavy air raid.]]\n\nAccording to [[Anna Freud]] and [[Edward Glover (psychoanalyst)|Edward Glover]], London civilians surprisingly did not suffer from widespread [[shell shock]], unlike the soldiers in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]].<ref>Ingersol, 1940, pp. 114,117\u2013118</ref> The psychoanalysts were correct, and the special network of psychiatric clinics opened to receive mental casualties of the attacks closed due to lack of need. Although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks, eating disorders, fatigue, weeping, miscarriages, and other physical and mental ailments, society did not collapse. The number of suicides and drunkenness declined, and London recorded only about two cases of \"bomb neurosis\" per week in the first three months of bombing. Many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family, and after the first few weeks of bombing, avoidance of the evacuation programmes grew.<ref>Field 2002, pp. 15\u201320.</ref><ref>Titmuss 1950, pp. 340, 349.</ref><ref>Mackay 2002, pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe cheerful crowds visiting bomb sites were so large they interfered with rescue work,{{r|Field 2002, p. 15-20.}} pub visits increased in number (beer was never rationed), and 13,000 attended [[Lord's Cricket Ground|cricket at Lord's]]. People left shelters when told instead of refusing to leave, although many housewives reportedly enjoyed the break from housework. Some people even told government surveyors that they enjoyed air raids if they occurred occasionally, perhaps once a week. Despite the attacks, defeat in [[Battle of Norway|Norway]] and [[Battle of France|France]], and the threat of invasion, overall morale remained high; a [[Gallup poll]] found only 3% of Britons expected to lose the war in May 1940, another found an 88% approval rating for Churchill in July, and a third found 89% support for his leadership in October. Support for peace negotiations declined from 29% in February. Each setback caused more civilians to volunteer to become unpaid [[Local Defence Volunteers]], workers worked longer shifts and over weekends, contributions rose to the \u00a35,000 \"[[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] Funds\" to build fighters and the number of work days lost to strikes in 1940 was the lowest in history.<ref>Mackay2002, pp. 60\u201363, 67\u201368, 75, 78\u201379, 215\u2013216</ref>\n\n===Civilian mobilisation===\nCivilians of London played an enormous role in protecting their city. Many civilians who were unwilling or unable to join the military joined the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the [[Air Raid Precautions]] service (ARP), the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] and many other civilian organisations; the AFS had 138,000 personnel by July 1939. Only one year earlier, there had only been 6,600 full-time and 13,800 part-time firemen in the entire country.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 51.</ref> Before the war, civilians were issued with 50 million respirators (gas masks) in case bombardment with gas began before evacuation.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 50.</ref> During the Blitz, [[The Scout Association]] guided fire engines to where they were most needed and became known as the \"Blitz Scouts\". Many unemployed people were drafted into the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]] and with the [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]], were tasked with salvaging and clean-up.<ref>Hill 2002, p. 36.</ref> The [[Civil Defence Service|Women's Voluntary Services for Civil Defence]] (WVS) was established in 1938 by the [[Home Secretary]], [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], who considered it the female branch of the ARP.<ref name=\"Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 84.\">Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 84.</ref> The WVS organised the evacuation of children, established centres for those displaced by bombing and operated canteens, salvage and recycling schemes. By the end of 1941, the WVS had one million members.<ref name=\"Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 84.\"/>\n\nPre-war dire predictions of mass air-raid neurosis were not borne out. Predictions had underestimated civilian adaptability and resourcefulness; also there were many new civil defence roles that gave a sense of fighting back rather than despair. Official histories concluded that the mental health of a nation may have improved, while panic was rare.<ref>Edgar Jones, et al. \"Civilian morale during the Second World War: Responses to air raids re-examined.\" ''Social History of Medicine'' 17.3 (2004): 463\u2013479.</ref>\n\n==Pre-war RAF night defence==\n{{See also|Anti-aircraft warfare}}\n\nBritish air doctrine, since [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] had commanded the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (1915\u20131917), stressed offence as the best means of defence,<ref>Hyde 1976, pp. 138, 223\u2013228.</ref> which became known as the [[cult of the offensive]]. To prevent German formations from hitting targets in Britain, Bomber Command would destroy ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft on their bases, aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants. This philosophy proved impractical, as Bomber Command lacked the technology and equipment for mass night operations, since resources were diverted to Fighter Command in the mid-1930s and it took until 1943 to catch up. Dowding agreed air defence would require some offensive action and that fighters could not defend Britain alone.<ref>Ray 2009, p. 127.</ref> Until September 1939, the RAF lacked specialist night-fighting aircraft and relied on anti-aircraft units, which were poorly equipped and lacking in numbers.<ref>Ray 1996, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref>\n\nThe attitude of the Air Ministry was in contrast to the experiences of the [[World War I|First World War]] when German bombers caused physical and psychological damage out of all proportion to their numbers. Around {{convert|280|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} (9,000 bombs) had been dropped, killing 1,413 people and injuring 3,500 more. Many people over 35 remembered the bombing and were afraid of more. From 1916\u20131918, German raids had diminished against countermeasures which demonstrated defence against night air raids was possible.<ref>Ray 2009, p. 125.</ref> Although night air defence was causing greater concern before the war, it was not at the forefront of RAF planning after 1935, when funds were directed into the new ground-based radar day fighter interception system. The difficulty of RAF bombers in night navigation and target finding led the British to believe that it would be the same for German bomber crews. There was also a mentality in all air forces that flying by day would obviate the need for night operations and their inherent disadvantages.<ref>Ray 2009, p. 126.</ref>\n\n[[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]], [[Air Officer Commanding]] Fighter Command, defeated the ''Luftwaffe'' in the Battle of Britain, but preparing day fighter defences left little for night air defence. When the ''Luftwaffe'' struck at British cities for the first time on 7 September 1940, a number of civic and political leaders were worried by Dowding's apparent lack of reaction to the new crisis.<ref name=\"Ray\">Ray 2009, p. 124.</ref> Dowding accepted that as AOC, he was responsible for the day and night defence of Britain but seemed reluctant to act quickly and his critics in the Air Staff felt that this was due to his stubborn nature. Dowding was summoned on 17 October, to explain the poor state of the night defences and the supposed (but ultimately successful) \"failure\" of his daytime strategy. The [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and Churchill distanced themselves. The failure to prepare adequate night air defences was undeniable but it was not the responsibility of the AOC Fighter Command to dictate the disposal of resources. The general neglect of the RAF until the late spurt in 1938, left few resources for night air defence and the Government, through the Air Ministry and other civil and military institutions was responsible for policy. Before the war, the Chamberlain government stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort.<ref name=\"Ray\" />\n\n==Technology==\n\n===German night navigation devices===\n{{Main|Battle of the Beams}}\n[[File:Map of Knickebein transmitters.svg|thumb|Map of Knickebein transmitters]]\n\nBecause of the inaccuracy of [[celestial navigation]] for night navigation and target finding in a fast moving aircraft, the ''Luftwaffe'' developed [[radio navigation]] devices and relied on three systems: ''[[Knickebein]]'' (Crooked leg), ''[[X-Ger\u00e4t]]'' (X-Device), and ''[[Y-Ger\u00e4t]]'' (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, which became known as the Battle of the Beams.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 194.</ref> Bomber crews already had some experience with the [[Lorenz beam]], a commercial blind-landing aid for night or bad weather landings. The Germans adapted the short-range Lorenz system into ''Knickebein'', a 30\u201333&nbsp;MHz system, which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signals. Two aerials at ground stations were rotated so that their beams converged over the target. The German bombers would fly along either beam until they picked up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and dropped their bombs.<ref>Air, 2001, p. 93</ref><ref name=\"Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328\">Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328</ref>\n\n''Knickebein'' was in general use but the ''X-Ger\u00e4t'' (X apparatus) was reserved for specially trained pathfinder crews. ''X-Ger\u00e4t'' receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the fuselage. The system worked on 66\u201377&nbsp;MHz, a higher frequency than ''Knickebein''. Ground transmitters sent pulses at a rate of 180 per minute. ''X-Ger\u00e4t'' received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot visual and aural directions. Three cross-beams intersected the beam along which the He 111 was flying. The first cross-beam alerted the bomb-aimer, who activated a bombing clock when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The clock mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bombs were released.<ref name=\"Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328\"/><ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 89.\">Mackay 2003, p. 89.</ref>\n\n''Y-Ger\u00e4t'' was an automatic beam-tracking system and the most complex of the three devices, which was operated through the autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a ground controller. Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to be measured precisely. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by a code word from the ground controller or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of ''Y-Ger\u00e4t'' was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.<ref name=\"Hinsley, 1979, pp. 315\u2013328\"/><ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 89.\"/>\n\n===British countermeasures===\nIn June 1940, a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the ''Knickebein'', even though it was under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. [[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]], who started a search which discovered that ''Luftwaffe'' Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; [[Avro Anson]]s of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30&nbsp;MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to [[Derby]] (which had been mentioned in ''Luftwaffe'' transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital [[Cauterization#Electrocautery|electrocautery]] machines.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389\">Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389.</ref> The counter-operations were carried out by British [[Electronic Counter Measures]] (ECM) units under Wing Commander [[Edward Addison]], [[No. 80 Wing RAF]]. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as [[meaconing]] using masking beacons ({{not a typo|meacons}}).{{sfn|Hooton|2010|p=84}} Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened their paths, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets; confidence in the device was diminished by the time the ''Luftwaffe'' was ready to conduct big raids.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389\"/>\n\nGerman beacons operated on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which enabled the ''Luftwaffe'' crews to determine the signal's bearing. The meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\">Mackay 2003, p. 91.</ref> In general, German bombers were likely to get through to their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night-fighter force would be ready, and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]] only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary (\"Starfish\") targets.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\"/>\n\nFor industrial areas, fires and lighting were simulated. It was decided to recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, [[carbon arc]] lamps were used to simulate the flash of [[tram]] cables. Red lamps were used to simulate [[blast furnace]]s and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden panels.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\"/> The use of diversionary techniques such as fires had to be made carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were similar to those of the German C-250 and C-500 ''Flammbomben''. The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real target.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 91.\"/>\n\n==First phase==\n\n===''Loge'' and ''Seeschlange''===\n[[File:London Blitz 791940.jpg|thumb|Smoke rising from fires in the London docks, following bombing on 7 September]]\n\nThe first deliberate air raids on London were mainly aimed at the [[Port of London]], causing severe damage.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 35.\"/> Late in the afternoon of 7 September 1940, the Germans began Operation London (''Unternehmen Loge'') (the codename for London) and ''Seeschlange'' (Sea Snake), the air offensives against London and other industrial cities. ''Loge'' continued for 57 nights.<ref name=\"Bungay 2000, p. 313.\">Bungay 2000, p. 313.</ref> A total of 348 bombers and 617 fighters took part in the attack.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 309.</ref><ref>Shores 1985, p. 52.</ref>\n\nInitially the change in strategy caught the RAF off-guard and caused extensive damage and civilian casualties. Some 107,400 gross tons of shipping was damaged in the [[Thames Estuary]] and 1,600 civilians were casualties.<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 26.</ref> Of this total around 400 were killed.<ref>Stansky 2007, p. 95.</ref> The fighting in the air was more intense in daylight. ''Loge'' had cost the ''Luftwaffe'' 41 aircraft; 14 bombers, 16 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s, seven [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s and four reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 310.</ref> Fighter Command lost 23 fighters, with six pilots killed and another seven wounded.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 311.</ref> Another 247 bombers from ''Luftflotte'' 3 (Air Fleet 3) attacked that night.<ref>Collier 1980, p. 178.</ref> On 8 September the ''Luftwaffe'' returned; 412 people were killed and 747 severely wounded.<ref name=\"Bungay 2000, p. 313.\"/>\n\nOn 9 September the ''OKL'' appeared to be backing two strategies. Its round-the-clock bombing of London was an immediate attempt to force the British government to capitulate, but it was also striking at Britain's vital sea communications to achieve a victory through siege. Although the weather was poor, heavy raids took place that afternoon on the London suburbs and the airfield at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]]. The day's fighting cost Kesselring and ''[[Luftflotte 2]]'' (Air Fleet 2) 24 aircraft, including 13 Bf 109s. Fighter Command lost 17 fighters and six pilots. Over the next few days weather was poor and the next main effort would not be made until 15 September 1940.<ref name=\"Bungay 2000, p. 313.\"/>\n\nOn 15 September the ''Luftwaffe'' made two large daylight attacks on London along the Thames Estuary, targeting the docks and rail communications in the city. Its hope was to destroy its targets and draw the RAF into defending them, allowing the ''Luftwaffe'' to destroy their fighters in large numbers, thereby achieving an air superiority.<ref name=\"Price 1990, p. 12\"/> Large air battles broke out, lasting for most of the day. The first attack merely damaged the rail network for three days,<ref>Goss 2000, p. 154.</ref> and the second attack failed altogether.<ref>Price 1990, pp. 93\u2013104.</ref> The air battle was later commemorated by Battle of Britain Day. The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 18 percent of the bombers sent on the operations that day, and failed to gain air superiority.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 80.\">Hooton 2010, p. 80.</ref>\n\nWhile G\u00f6ring was optimistic the ''Luftwaffe'' could prevail, Hitler was not. On 17 September he postponed Operation Sea Lion (as it turned out, indefinitely) rather than gamble Germany's newly gained military prestige on a risky cross-Channel operation, particularly in the face of a sceptical [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union. In the last days of the battle, the bombers became lures in an attempt to draw the RAF into combat with German fighters. But their operations were to no avail; the worsening weather and unsustainable attrition in daylight gave the ''OKL'' an excuse to switch to night attacks on 7 October.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 80.\"/><ref>Shores 1985, p. 55.</ref><ref>McKee 1989, p. 286.</ref>\n\n[[File:Birmingham Blitz D 4126.jpg|thumb|Bomb damage to a street [[Birmingham Blitz|in Birmingham]] after an air raid]]\n\nOn 14 October, the heaviest night attack to date saw 380 German bombers from ''Luftflotte'' 3 hit London. Around 200 people were killed and another 2,000 injured. British anti-aircraft defences (General [[Frederick Alfred Pile]]) fired 8,326 rounds and shot down only two bombers. On 15 October, the bombers returned and about 900 fires were started by the mix of {{convert|415|ST|t|abbr=on}} of [[high explosive]] and {{convert|11|ST|t|abbr=on}} of [[Incendiary device#Development and use in World War II|incendiaries]] dropped. Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock damaged.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 131.</ref>\n\n''Loge'' continued during October. {{convert|9000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped that month, about 10 percent in daylight, over {{convert|6000|ST|t|abbr=on}} on London during the night. Birmingham and Coventry were subject to {{convert|500|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs between them in the last 10 days of October. Liverpool suffered {{convert|200|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs dropped. Hull and [[Glasgow]] were attacked but {{convert|800|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were spread out all over Britain. The [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] works in [[Manchester]] was hit by {{convert|12|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs. Little tonnage was dropped on Fighter Command airfields; Bomber Command airfields were hit instead.<ref>James and Cox 2000, p. 307.</ref>\n\n[[File:Blitzaftermath.jpg|thumb|left|Firefighters tackling a blaze amongst ruined buildings after an air raid on London]]\n\n''Luftwaffe'' policy at this point was primarily to continue progressive attacks on London, chiefly by night attack; second, to interfere with production in the vast industrial arms factories of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], again chiefly by night attack; and third to disrupt plants and factories during the day by means of fighter-bombers.<ref>James and Cox 2000, p. 308.</ref>\n\nKesselring, commanding ''Luftflotte'' 2, was ordered to send 50 sorties per night against London and attack eastern harbours in daylight. Sperrle, commanding ''Luftflotte'' 3, was ordered to dispatch 250 sorties per night including 100 against the West Midlands. ''Seeschlange'' would be carried out by [[10th Air Corps (Germany)|''Fliegerkorps'' X]] (10th Air Corps) which concentrated on mining operations against shipping. It also took part in the bombing over Britain. By 19/20 April 1941, it had dropped 3,984 mines, {{frac|1|3}} of the total dropped. The mines' ability to destroy entire streets earned them respect in Britain, but several fell unexploded into British hands allowing counter-measures to be developed which damaged the German anti-shipping campaign.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 34.\"/>\n\nBy mid-November 1940, when the Germans adopted a changed plan, more than {{convert|13000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London. Outside the capital, there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft, as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool, but no major raids. The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding, and much damage had been done to the railway system outside. In September, there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain, and at one period, between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs. But the great bulk of the traffic went on; and Londoners\u2014though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station, or made strange detours round back streets in the buses\u2014still got to work. For all the destruction of life and property, the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale. More than 13,000 civilians had been killed, and almost 20,000 injured, in September and October alone,<ref>Richards 1954, p. 206.</ref> but the death toll was much less than expected. In late 1940, Churchill credited the shelters.<ref>''Knickerbocker'', 1941, pp. 372\u2013373<!--how do you cite a source without author, publisher, & city, exactly?!--></ref>\n\nWartime observers perceived the bombing as indiscriminate.

Ground-based [[radar]] was limited, and airborne radar and RAF night fighters were generally ineffective.<ref>Price 1990, p. 20.</ref> RAF day fighters were converting to night operations and the interim [[Bristol Blenheim]] night fighter conversion of the light bomber was being replaced by the powerful [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], but this was only available in very small numbers.<ref name=\"Shores 1985, p. 57.\"/> By the second month of the Blitz the defences were not performing well.<ref>Dobinson 2001, p. 252.</ref> London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]]. The difference this made to the effectiveness of air defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy [[anti-aircraft artillery]] AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]]; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type.<ref>Taylor 1969, p. 326.</ref> AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 193.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hendon 190913 Boulton Paul Defiant 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boulton Paul Defiant]] night fighter ''N1671'']]\n\n[[Airborne Interception radar]] (AI) was unreliable. The heavy fighting in the Battle of Britain had eaten up most of Fighter Command's resources, so there was little investment in night fighting. Bombers were flown with [[Turbinlite|airborne search lights]] out of desperation but to little avail. Of greater potential was the GL (Gunlaying) radar and searchlights with fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led Interception) under Group-level control ([[No. 10 Group RAF]], [[No. 11 Group RAF]] and [[No. 12 Group RAF]]).<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 32.\">Hooton 1997, p. 32.</ref> [[Whitehall]]'s disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]] on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67 per cent of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43 per cent of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61 percent of the combats. Yet when compared with ''Luftwaffe'' daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to one per cent. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance of evading it.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 32.\"/>\n\nNevertheless, it was radar that proved to be the critical weapon in the night battles over Britain from this point onward. Dowding had introduced the concept of airborne radar and encouraged its usage. Eventually it would become a success. On the night of 22/23 July 1940, [[Flying Officer]] Cyril Ashfield (pilot), [[Pilot Officer]] Geoffrey Morris (Observer) and [[Flight Sergeant]] Reginald Leyland (Air Intercept radar operator) of the [[Fighter Interception Unit]] became the first pilot and crew to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft using on-board radar to guide them to a visual interception, when their AI night fighter brought down a Do 17 off Sussex.<ref>White 2007, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> On 19 November 1940 the famous RAF night fighter ace [[John Cunningham (RAF officer)|John Cunningham]] shot down a Ju 88 bomber using airborne radar, just as Dowding had predicted.<ref>Holland 2007, pp. 602\u2013603.</ref> By mid-November, nine squadrons were available, but only one was equipped with Beaufighters ([[No. 219 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Kenley]]). By 16 February 1941, this had grown to 12; with five equipped, or partially equipped with Beaufighters spread over five Groups.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 189.</ref>\n\n==Second phase==\n\n===Night attacks===\n[[File:Coventry bomb damage H5600.jpg|thumb|[[Coventry]] city centre following [[Coventry Blitz|14/15 November 1940 raid]]]]\n\nFrom November 1940 to February 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' shifted its strategy and attacked other industrial cities.<ref>Cooper 1981, p. 170.</ref> In particular, the West Midlands were targeted. On the night of 13/14 November, 77 He 111s of [[Kampfgeschwader 26|''Kampfgeschwader'' 26]] (26th Bomber Wing, or KG 26) bombed London while 63 from [[Kampfgeschwader 55|KG 55]] hit Birmingham. The next night, a large force hit Coventry. \"Pathfinders\" from 12 [[Kampfgruppe 100|''Kampfgruppe'' 100]] (Bomb Group 100 or KGr&nbsp;100) led 437 bombers from [[Kampfgeschwader 1|KG 1]], [[Kampfgeschwader 3|KG 3]], KG&nbsp;26, KG 27, KG&nbsp;55 and [[Lehrgeschwader 1|''Lehrgeschwader'' 1]] (1st Training Wing, or LG&nbsp;1) which dropped {{convert|394|ST|t|abbr=on}} of high explosive, {{convert|56|ST|t|abbr=on}} of incendiaries, and 127 parachute mines.<ref name=\"Shores 1985, p. 57.\">Shores 1985, p. 57.</ref> Other sources say 449 bombers and a total of {{convert|530|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 35\">Hooton 1997, p. 35.</ref> The raid against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led to widespread use of the phrase \"to conventrate\".<ref name=\"Shores 1985, p. 57.\"/> Over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped.<ref>Gaskin 2005, p. 156.</ref> Around 21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry, and loss of public utilities stopped work at nine others, disrupting industrial output for several months. Only one bomber was lost, to anti-aircraft fire, despite the RAF flying 125 night sorties. No follow up raids were made, as ''OKL'' underestimated the British power of recovery (as Bomber Command would do over Germany from 1943\u20131945).<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 35\"/> The Germans were surprised by the success of the attack. The concentration had been achieved by accident.<ref>Price 1977, pp. 43\u201345.</ref> The strategic effect of the raid was a brief 20 percent dip in aircraft production.<ref name=\"Cooper 1981, p. 173.\"/>\n\n[[File:View from St Paul's Cathedral after the Blitz.jpg|thumb|left|View from St. Paul's Cathedral after the Blitz]]\n\nFive nights later, Birmingham was hit by 369 bombers from [[Kampfgeschwader 54|KG 54]], KG&nbsp;26, and KG&nbsp;55. By the end of November, 1,100 bombers were available for night raids. An average of 200 were able to strike per night. This weight of attack went on for two months, with the ''Luftwaffe'' dropping {{convert|13900|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs.<ref name=\"Shores 1985, p. 57.\"/> In November 1940, 6,000 sorties and 23 major attacks (more than 100 tons of bombs dropped) were flown. Two heavy ({{convert|50|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs) attacks were also flown. In December, only 11 major and five heavy attacks were made.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 87.\">Hooton 2010, p. 87.</ref>\n\nProbably the most devastating attack occurred on the evening of 29 December, when German aircraft attacked the [[City of London]] itself with [[Firebombing|incendiary]] and high explosive bombs, causing a firestorm that has been called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 36.</ref> The first group to use these incendiaries was ''Kampfgruppe'' 100 which despatched 10 \"pathfinder\" He 111s. At 18:17, it released the first of 10,000 fire bombs, eventually amounting to 300 dropped per minute.<ref>Gaskin 2005, p. 193.</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2018}} Altogether, 130 German bombers destroyed the historical centre of London.<ref>Mackay 2003, p. 94.</ref> Civilian casualties on London throughout the Blitz amounted to 28,556 killed, and 25,578 wounded. The ''Luftwaffe'' had dropped {{convert|18291|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs.<ref>Stansky 2007, p. 180.</ref>\n\nNot all of the ''Luftwaffe'' effort was made against inland cities. Port cities were also attacked to try to disrupt trade and sea communications. In January, Swansea was bombed four times, very heavily. On 17 January around 100 bombers dropped a high concentration of incendiaries, some 32,000 in all. The main damage was inflicted on the commercial and domestic areas. Four days later 230 tons was dropped including 60,000 incendiaries. In Portsmouth [[Southsea]] and [[Gosport]] waves of 150 bombers destroyed vast swaths of the city with 40,000 incendiaries. Warehouses, rail lines and houses were destroyed and damaged, but the docks were largely untouched.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 185.</ref> In January and February 1941, ''Luftwaffe'' serviceability rates declined, until just 551 of 1,214 bombers were combat worthy. Seven major and eight heavy attacks were flown, but the weather made it difficult to keep up the pressure. Still, at [[Southampton]], attacks were so effective morale did give way briefly with civilian authorities leading people ''en masse'' out of the city.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 87.\"/>\n\n===Strategic or \"terror\" bombing===\n{{See also|Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u20131945)#Organization of the Luftwaffe|l1=Organization of the Luftwaffe}}\n[[File:WWII London Blitz East London.jpg|thumb|Children in the [[East End of London]], made homeless by the Blitz]]\n\nAlthough official German air doctrine did target civilian morale, it did not espouse the attacking of civilians directly. It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories and public utilities as well as its food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant the target area needed to be illuminated and hit \"without regard for the civilian population\".<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 34.\">Hooton 1997, p. 34.</ref> Special units, such as ''KGr'' 100, became the ''Beleuchtergruppe'' (Firelighter Group), which used incendiaries and high explosive to mark the target area. The tactic was expanded into ''Feuerleitung'' (Blaze Control) with the creation of ''Brandbombenfelder'' (Incendiary Fields) to mark targets. These were marked out by parachute flares. Then bombers carrying [[SC1000 bomb|SC&nbsp;1000]] ({{convert|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}), SC&nbsp;1400 ({{convert|1400|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}), and SC&nbsp;1800 ({{convert|1800|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}) \"Satan\" bombs were used to level streets and residential areas. By December, the SC&nbsp;2500 ({{convert|2500|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}) \"Max\" bomb was used.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 34.\"/>\n\nThese decisions, apparently taken at the ''Luftflotte'' or ''Fliegerkorps'' level, meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was, for all intents and purposes, an unrestricted area attack or ''Terrorangriff'' (Terror Attack).<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\">Hooton 2010, p. 85.</ref> Part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation. The effectiveness of British countermeasures against ''Knickebein'', which was designed to avoid area attacks, forced the ''Luftwaffe'' to resort to these methods.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/> The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped. ''KGr'' 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13\u201328 percent. By December, this had increased to 92 percent.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/> Use of incendiaries, which were inherently inaccurate, indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites. Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/> Captured German air crews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 85.\"/>\n\n==Final attacks==\n\n===Directive 23: G\u00f6ring and the ''Kriegsmarine''===\n{{See also|List of Adolf Hitler's directives#Directive 23|l1=Directive 23}}\n\nIn 1941, the ''Luftwaffe'' shifted strategy again. [[Erich Raeder]]\u2014commander-in-chief of the ''Kriegsmarine''\u2014had long argued the ''Luftwaffe'' should support the German submarine force (''U-Bootwaffe'') in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by attacking shipping in the Atlantic Ocean and attacking British ports.<ref>Raeder 2001, p. 322.</ref> Eventually, he convinced Hitler of the need to attack British port facilities.<ref>Over 1980, p. 36.</ref> At Raeder's prompting, Hitler correctly noted that the greatest damage to the British war economy had been done through the destruction of merchant shipping by submarines and air attacks by small numbers of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] naval aircraft and ordered the German air arm to focus its efforts against British convoys. This meant that British coastal centres and shipping at sea west of Ireland were the prime targets.<ref>Isby 2005, p. 110.</ref>\n\nHitler's interest in this strategy forced G\u00f6ring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to G\u00f6ring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, ''Directions for operations against the British War Economy'', which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\">Hooton 2010, p. 88.</ref> This strategy had been recognised before the war, but [[Operation Eagle Attack]] and the following Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 195.</ref> The ''OKL'' had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries.<ref>Isby 2005, p. 109.</ref>\n\nDirective 23 was the only concession made by G\u00f6ring to the ''Kriegsmarine'' over the strategic bombing strategy of the ''Luftwaffe'' against Britain. Thereafter, he would refuse to make available any air units to destroy British dockyards, ports, port facilities, or shipping in dock or at sea, lest ''Kriegsmarine'' gain control of more ''Luftwaffe'' units.<ref>Overy 1980, p. 37.</ref> Raeder's successor\u2014[[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\u2014would\u2014on the intervention of Hitler\u2014gain control of one unit ([[Kampfgeschwader 40|KG 40]]), but G\u00f6ring would soon regain it. G\u00f6ring's lack of co-operation was detrimental to the one air strategy with potentially decisive strategic effect on Britain. Instead, he wasted aircraft of ''[[Fliegerf\u00fchrer Atlantik]]'' (Flying Command Atlantic) on bombing mainland Britain instead of attacks against convoys.<ref>Murray 1983, p. 136.</ref> For G\u00f6ring, his prestige had been damaged by the defeat in the Battle of Britain, and he wanted to regain it by subduing Britain by air power alone. He was always reluctant to co-operate with Raeder.<ref>Murray 1983, p. 135.</ref>\n\nEven so, the decision by the ''OKL'' to support the strategy in Directive 23 was instigated by two considerations, both of which had little to do with wanting to destroy Britain's sea communications in conjunction with the ''Kriegsmarine''. First, the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break led the ''OKL'' to adopt the naval option.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/> The indifference displayed by the ''OKL'' to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure, or diverting strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives. Other targets would be considered if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather conditions.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/>\n\nA further line in the directive stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible, but also to intensify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941. However, meteorological conditions over Britain<!--when? Winter '40?--> were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations. Airfields became water-logged and the 18 ''Kampfgruppen'' (bomber groups) of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s ''[[Kampfgeschwader]]n'' (bomber wings) were relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/>\n\n===British ports===\nFrom the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The ''Luftwaffe'' flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the ''Luftwaffe'' flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-''Ger\u00e4t'' beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-''Ger\u00e4t'', whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-''Ger\u00e4t''.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/>\n\nBy now, the imminent threat of invasion had all but passed as the ''Luftwaffe'' had failed to gain the prerequisite air superiority. The aerial bombing was now principally aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but also continued with the objective of breaking the morale of the civilian population.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=52}} The attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven ''Kampfgruppen'' moved to Austria in preparation for the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]]. The shortage of bombers caused ''OKL'' to improvise.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 88.\"/> Some 50 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers and ''Jabos'' (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as ''Leichte Kampfflugzeuge'' (\"light bombers\") and sometimes called ''Leichte Kesselringe'' (\"Light Kesselrings\"). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, only one-third of German bombs hit their targets.<ref>Hooton 2010, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n[[File:Liverpool Blitz D 5984.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Liverpool city centre after heavy bombing]]\n\nThe diversion of heavier bombers to the Balkans meant that the crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of [[Kampfgeschwader 30|KG 30]] was flying on his 50th mission. He fell asleep at the controls of his Ju 88 and woke up to discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and Dextro-Energen tablets, then completed the mission.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\">Hooton 1997, p. 37.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' could still inflict much damage and after the German conquest of Western Europe, the air and submarine offensive against British sea communications became much more dangerous than the German offensive during the First World War. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the [[Western Approaches]] from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the country.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 205.</ref> Air attacks sank {{convert|39126|LT|t|abbr=on}} of shipping, with another {{convert|111601|LT|t|abbr=on}} damaged. Minister of Home Security [[Herbert Morrison]] was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\"/> Other sources point out that half of the 144 berths in the port were rendered unusable and cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75 percent. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged, amounting to {{convert|80000|LT|t|abbr=on}}. Around 66,000 houses were destroyed and 77,000 people made homeless (\"bombed out\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Black Saturday|last=Schwarz|first=Benjamin|date=April 2008|work=The Atlantic|access-date=|page=85}}</ref>), with 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one night.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 207.</ref> Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale. The populace of the port of Hull became \"trekkers\", people who made a mass exodus from cities before, during and after attacks.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 37.\"/> The ''Luftwaffe'' attacks failed to knock out railways or port facilities for long, even in the Port of London, a target of many attacks.<ref name=\"Overy 1980, p. 35.\" /> The Port of London in particular was an important target, bringing in one-third of overseas trade.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 16.</ref>\n\nOn 13 March, the upper [[River Clyde|Clyde]] port of [[Clydebank]] near Glasgow was bombed ([[Clydebank Blitz]]). All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many more ports were attacked. [[Plymouth]] was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and [[Cardiff]] were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, [[Portsmouth]] centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people.<ref name=\"Calder 2003, p. 37.\">Calder 2003, p. 37.</ref> Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth.<ref name=\"Cooper 1981, p. 174.\"/><ref>Calder 2003, p. 119.</ref> Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged, the electrical supply was knocked out, and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs, including 160 tons of high explosive and 32,000 incendiaries. Much of the city centre was destroyed. Damage was inflicted on the port installations, but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April 346 tons of explosives and 46,000 incendiaries were dropped from 250 bombers led by ''KG'' 26. The damage was considerable, and the Germans also used aerial mines. Over 2,000 AAA shells were fired, destroying two Ju 88s.<ref>Ray 1996, pp. 215, 217.</ref> By the end of the air campaign over Britain, only eight percent of the German effort against British ports was made using mines.<ref>Neitzel 2003, p. 453.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Second World War 1939 - 1945- the Home Front HU1129.jpg|thumb|Firefighters at work amongst burning buildings, during the large raid of 10/11 May]]\n\nIn the north, substantial efforts were made against [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which were large ports on the English east coast. On 9 April 1941 ''Luftflotte 2'' dropped 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries from 120 bombers in a five-hour attack. Sewer, rail, docklands, and electric installations were damaged. In Sunderland on 25 April, ''Luftflotte 2'' sent 60 bombers which dropped 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries. Much damage was done. A further attack on the Clyde, this time at [[Greenock Blitz|Greenock]], took place on 6 and 7 May. However, as with the attacks in the south, the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple industry in the regions.<ref>Ray 1996, p. 225.</ref>\n\nThe last major attack on London was on 10/11 May 1941, on which the ''Luftwaffe'' flew 571 sorties and dropped 800 tonnes of bombs.

Added to the fact an interception relied on visual sighting, a kill was most unlikely even in the conditions of a moonlit sky.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, pp. 86\u201387.\"/> The [[Boulton Paul Defiant]], despite its poor performance during daylight engagements, was a much better night fighter. It was faster, able to catch the bombers and its configuration of four machine guns in a turret could (much like German night fighters in 1943\u20131945 with ''[[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]]'') engage the German bomber from beneath. Attacks from below offered a larger target, compared to attacking tail-on, as well as a better chance of not being seen by the crew (so less chance of evasion), as well as greater likelihood of detonating its bomb load. In subsequent months a steady number of German bombers would fall to night fighters.<ref name=\"Mackay 2003, p. 87.\">Mackay 2003, p. 87.</ref>\n\nImproved aircraft designs were in the offing with the Bristol Beaufighter, then under development.

The ''Luftwaffe'' dropped around {{convert|45000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs during the Blitz, which disrupted production and transport, reduced food supplies, and shook British morale. The bombing also helped to support the [[U-boat]] blockade by sinking some {{convert|58000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of shipping and damaging {{convert|450000|LT|t|abbr=on}} more. Despite the bombing, British production rose steadily throughout this period, although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers for Easter Holidays, according to the British official history. The official history volume ''British War Production'' (Postan, 1952) noted that the greatest effect on output of warlike stores was on the supply of components and dispersal of production rather than complete equipments.<ref>Postan, 1952, pp. 164\u2013166</ref><ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 89.\">Hooton 2010, p. 89.</ref>\n\nIn aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of the industry, at first because of damage to aircraft factories and then by a policy of precautionary dispersal.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\"/> In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, [[rifle]] production fell by 25 per cent, filled-shell production by 4.6 per cent and in small-arms production 4.5 per cent.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\"/> The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took from 10\u201315 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer. The attacks against Birmingham took war industries some three months to recover fully. The exhausted population took three weeks to overcome the effects of an attack.<ref name=\"Hooton 1997, p. 38.\"/>\n\nThe air offensive against the RAF and British industry failed to have the desired effect. More might have been achieved had ''OKL'' exploited the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber Command attacked rail communications and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] targeted oil, but that would have required an economic-industrial analysis of which the ''Luftwaffe'' was incapable.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 89.\"/> ''OKL'' instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently), and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than strategy.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 90.\">Hooton 2010, p. 90.</ref> Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz cost around 41,000 lives, may have injured another 139,000 people, and did enormous damage to British infrastructure and housing stock.<ref name=\"Foot and Dear 2005, p. 109.\"/>\n\n===RAF evaluation===\nThe British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941 and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries, because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the ''Luftwaffe'' had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.<ref name=\"Hooton 2010, p. 90.\"/>\n[[File:A British airman is amongst a group of civilians crowded around the window of a shop in Holborn, London, to look at a map illustrating how the RAF is striking back at Germany during 1940. D1254.jpg|thumb|People in London look at a map illustrating how the RAF is striking back at Germany during 1940]]\nSome writers claim the Air Staff ignored a critical lesson, that British morale did not break and that attacking German morale was not sufficient to induce a collapse. Aviation strategists dispute that morale was ever a major consideration for Bomber Command. Throughout 1933\u201339 none of the 16 Western Air Plans drafted mentioned morale as a target. The first three directives in 1940 did not mention civilian populations or morale in any way. Morale was not mentioned until the ninth wartime directive on 21 September 1940.<ref>Hall 1998, p. 118.</ref> The 10th directive in October 1940 mentioned morale by name but industrial cities were only to be targeted if weather prevented raids on oil targets.<ref>Hall 1998, p. 119.</ref>\n\nThe AOC Bomber Command, [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], who did see German morale as an objective, did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare) and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Battle of Berlin]], Harris declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve \"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable\".<ref name=\"Overy July 1980, p. 411.\" /><ref name=\"Hall\">Hall 1998, p. 120, 137.</ref>\nA summary of Harris' strategic intentions was clear,\n\n{{quote|From 1943 to the end of the war, he [Harris] and other proponents of the area offensive represented it [the bomber offensive] less as an attack on morale than as an assault on the housing, utilities, communications, and other services that supported the war production effort.|Hall<ref name=\"Hall\" />}}\n\nin comparison to the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, casualties due to the Blitz were relatively low; the [[bombing of Hamburg]] alone inflicted about 40,000 civilian casualties.<ref>Tooze, 2006, p. 601</ref>\n\n===Popular imagery and propaganda===\n[[File:Air Raid Damage in London, 1940 HU36206.jpg|thumb|upright|Women salvaging possessions from their bombed house, including plants and a clock]]\n\nA converse popular image arose of British people in the Second World War: a collection of people locked in national solidarity. This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of [[Angus Calder]]'s book ''The Myth of the Blitz'' (1991). It was evoked by both the right and left political factions in Britain during the [[Falklands War]] when it was embedded in a nostalgic narrative in which the Second World War represented aggressive British patriotism successfully defending democracy.<ref name=\"Summerfieldand\">Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 3.</ref><ref>Field 2002, p. 12.</ref> This imagery of people in the Blitz was and is powerfully portrayed in film, radio, newspapers and magazines.<ref>Summerfield and Peniston-Bird 2007, p. 4.</ref> At the time it was a useful propaganda tool for home and foreign consumption.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Historians' critical response to this construction focused on what were seen as over-emphasised claims of righteous nationalism and national unity. In the ''Myth of the Blitz'', Calder exposed some of the counter-evidence of anti-social and divisive behaviours. What he saw as the myth&nbsp;\u2013 serene national unity&nbsp;\u2013 became \"historical truth\". In particular, class division was most evident.<ref name=\"Summerfieldand\" />\n\nRaids during the Blitz produced the greatest divisions and morale effects in the working-class areas. Lack of sleep, insufficient shelters and inefficiency of warning systems were causes. The loss of sleep was a particular factor, with many not bothering to attend inconvenient shelters. The Communist Party made political capital out of these difficulties.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, in particular, took to using the Underground railway system, without authority, for shelter and sleeping through the night. So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the police were sent to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Home Secretary Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards, in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling. Still, many British citizens, who had been members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], itself inert over the issue, turned to the Communist Party. The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace. Though they failed to make a large gain in influence, the membership of the Party had doubled by June 1941.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 83\u201384.</ref> The \"Communist threat\" was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order, with the support of the Cabinet, the stoppage of the ''[[Daily Worker (UK)|Daily Worker]]'' and ''[[The Week]]''; the Communist newspaper and journal.<ref>Calder 2003, p. 88.</ref>\n\nThe brief success of the Communists also fed into the hands of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF). [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitic]] attitudes became widespread, particularly in London. Rumours that Jewish support was underpinning the Communist surge were frequent. Rumours that Jews were inflating prices, were responsible for the [[Black Market]], were the first to panic under attack (even the cause of the panic) and secured the best shelters via underhanded methods, were also widespread. There was also racial antagonism between the small Black, Indian and Jewish communities but there were no race riots despite the mixing of different peoples in confined areas.<!--why is this point made?--><ref>Field 2002, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn other cities, class conflict was more evident. Over a quarter of London's population had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population in south Wales and [[Gloucester]] intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including industry dispersal may have been a factor. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order.<ref>Calder 2003, pp. 129\u2013130.</ref> The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88 per cent of evacuated mothers, 86 per cent of small children, and 43 per cent of school children had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.<ref name=\"Field 2002, p. 13.\" />\n\n===Archive audio recordings===\nIn recent years a large number of wartime recordings relating to the Blitz have been made available on audiobooks such as ''The Blitz'', ''The Home Front'' and ''British War Broadcasting''.

As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nIn January 2011, Tramtrack Croydon opened a tender for the supply of ten new or second-hand trams from the end of summer 2011, for use between Therapia Lane and Elmers End.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |title=London Tramlink seeks bids for additional trams |date=31 January 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102131738/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |archivedate=2 November 2012  }}</ref><ref>Rail Magazine page 16, 'News in Brief \u2013 New Trams for Croydon' Issue 663, 9 \u2013 22 February 2011</ref><ref name=rgi20110818/> On 18 August 2011, TfL announced that [[Stadler Rail]] had won a $19.75 million contract to supply six [[Variotram|Variobahn]] trams similar to those used by [[Bergen Light Rail|Bybanen]] in [[Bergen]], Norway.<ref name=rgi20110818>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |title=Stadler wins London Tramlink tram order |date=18 August 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917051215/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |archivedate=17 September 2011  }}</ref> They entered service in 2012.<ref name=RailwayGazette21Aug13>[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html London Tramlink orders more Stadlet trams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103134936/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html |date=3 January 2017 }} ''Railway Gazette'' 21 August 2013</ref> In August 2013, TfL ordered an additional four Variotrams for delivery in 2015, for use on the Wimbledon to Croydon link, an order which was later increased to six.

Most stops are {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 Route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced. On Monday 4 April 2016, Route 4 was extended from Therapia Lane to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|title=Tram-endous boost for travellers|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|date=4 April 2016|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513142204/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|archive-date=13 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February 2018, the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services.

The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the \u00a3737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref> The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:\n\n====Phase A====\nTo support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used).

Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory.

Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point. The proposal is to terminate the line at [[Streatham railway station]], providing an interchange to the extended [[East London Line]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\n====Crystal Palace extension====\n[[File:Climbing the Addington Hills (5276420251).jpg|thumb|Near the summit of line 3, having climbed through the Addington Hills from [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]].]]\nThe proposed extension to [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace]] would have linked it to Harrington Road and Beckenham Junction, with services terminating at Crystal Palace Parade.<ref name=LambethCouncil>{{cite web|title=Croydon Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace|url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/Services/TransportStreets/PublicTransportTaxis/PublicTransportConsultation/ExtendingTramlinkToCrystalPalace.htm|work=Lambeth Council Website|publisher=Lambeth Council|accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> There were three options on how to get to the Parade: on-street, off-street and a mixture of the two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/trams/pdf/Crystal-Palace-2006-10-19.pdf |title=Crystal Palace extension options to reach the Parade |website=tfl.gov.uk |accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> After consultation in 2006 the off-street option was favoured, with trams running along existing railway as far as [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace Station]], and then running round the western edge of [[Crystal Palace Park]] (within the current park's perimeter) to the bus terminus near the parade.

Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nIn January 2011, Tramtrack Croydon opened a tender for the supply of ten new or second-hand trams from the end of summer 2011.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |title=London Tramlink seeks bids for additional trams |date=31 January 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102131738/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |archivedate=2 November 2012  }}</ref> The trams will be used between Therapia Lane and Elmers End.<ref>Rail Magazine page 16, 'News in Brief \u2013 New Trams for Croydon' Issue 663, 9 \u2013 22 February 2011</ref><ref name=rgi20110818/> On 18 August 2011, TfL announced that [[Stadler Rail]] had won a $19.75 million contract to supply six [[Variotram|Variobahn]] trams similar to those used by [[Bergen Light Rail|Bybanen]] in [[Bergen]], Norway.<ref name=rgi20110818>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |title=Stadler wins London Tramlink tram order |date=18 August 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917051215/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |archivedate=17 September 2011  }}</ref> They entered service in 2012.<ref name=RailwayGazette21Aug13>[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html London Tramlink orders more Stadlet trams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103134936/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html |date=3 January 2017 }} ''Railway Gazette'' 21 August 2013</ref> In August 2013, TfL ordered an additional four Variotrams for delivery in 2015, for use on the Wimbledon to Croydon link, an order which was later increased to six.

Most stops are {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 Route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced. On Monday 4 April 2016, Route 4 was extended from Therapia Lane to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|title=Tram-endous boost for travellers|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|date=4 April 2016|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513142204/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|archive-date=13 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February 2018, the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services.

The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the \u00a3737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref> The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:\n\n====Phase A====\nTo support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used).

Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory.

Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.

His greatest competitive achievement was winning the [[U.S. Open Chess Championship|U.S. Open Championship]] in 1948. He played in the [[U.S. Chess Championship|U.S. Championship]] five times.\n\nAdams is most famous for his controversial claim that the first move [[First-move advantage in chess#White wins with 1.e4|1.e4 confers a winning advantage]] upon [[White and Black in chess|White]]. He continually advocated this theory in books and magazine articles from 1939 until shortly before his death. Adams' claim has generally been scorned by the chess world. However, [[International Master]] [[Hans Berliner]] in a 1999 book professed admiration for Adams, and similarly claimed that White may claim a winning advantage, albeit with [[Queen's Pawn Game|1.d4]], not [[wikibooks:Opening theory in chess/1. e4|1.e4]].\n\nAdams did not succeed in showing the validity of his theory in his own tournament and match play. His results suffered because he published his [[List of chess terms#Opening preparation|analysis]] of White's supposed winning lines, thus forfeiting the element of surprise and enabling his opponents to prepare responses to his pet lines. Future [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Bobby Fischer]] used the Adams Attack, the line Adams advocated against the [[Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation|Najdorf Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defense]] (6.h3), with success.\n\n==Playing career==\nWeaver Adams was one of the leading American masters during the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>Grandmaster [[Arnold Denker]] and [[Larry Parr (editor)|Larry Parr]] listed Adams as one of 17 leading American masters during the years of the [[Great Depression]].

Also available on DVD (pages 251, 256, 258 in \"Chess Review 1948\" PDF file on DVD).</ref> Adams played in the 1950\u201351 [[Hastings, England|Hastings]] [[Hastings International Chess Congress#Premier .28Christmas Congress.29|Christmas Chess Congress]], but finished 9th out of 10 players with 2\u00bd/9 (two wins, six losses, one draw).<ref>{{Citation|author=Sunnucks, Anne|title=The Encyclopaedia of Chess|year=1970|page=188}}</ref>\n\nGrandmaster [[Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|Larry Evans]] wrote that Adams' \"tournament results were damaged by his dogmatism. Playing under the self-inflicted handicap of arming his opponents with advance knowledge of his 'best' lines, he felt honor-bound to steer straight into them even though his adversary invariably had a [[List of chess terms#Cook|cook]] up his sleeve. By the time Weaver found a refutation and published it, another player found a different cook and so on ''ad infinitum''.\"<ref>Evans, 1970, pp. 146-47.</ref> According to ''Chess Review'', this phenomenon may explain Adams' poor result at Hastings 1950\u201351.<ref>From ''Chess Review'', February 1951, p.&nbsp;35 (also available on DVD):\n\n<blockquote>According to some reports, Adams ran into trouble when he played opening lines which he has often publicized in connection with his theories on 'White to play and win.' These variations, it is said, had been anticipated by his rivals, who had prepared themselves with special analyses. If there is any truth in this account the moral for a chess player would seem to be the same as for a boxer\u2014namely, never to 'telegraph' his favorite blows.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==White to play and win theory==\n{{AN chess|pos=secright}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tleft\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n| | | | | | | | \n| | | | | | | | \n| | | | |pl| | | \n| | | | | | | | \n|pl|pl|pl|pl| |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|After 1.e4, \"White ought to win\", according to Adams.\n}}\nAdams was best known for his books and magazine articles in which he claimed and attempted to prove that White's [[first-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]] is decisive, i.e. that White has a forced win from the starting position. His first and most famous book arguing this, ''White to Play and Win'', was published in 1939. There, Adams claimed that 1.e4 was White's strongest move,<ref>Adams 1939, p. 5.</ref> and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter, \"White ought to win.\"<ref>Adams 1939, p. 10.</ref> If Black responded with 1 ... e5, Adams advocated the [[Bishop's Opening]], 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4.<ref>Adams 1939, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAdams was unable to prove his theory in tournament or match practice. The year after his book was published, he played in the U.S. Open at [[Dallas]], 1940. Ironically, in the finals he did not win a single game as White (three losses and one draw), but won all four of his games as Black.<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Chess at Dallas\n |author=Sturgis, G.\n |work=Chess Review\n |date=October 1940\n |page=146\n}} Also available on DVD (page 154 in \"Chess Review 1940\" PDF file on DVD).</ref> Adams also lost a match to [[International Master|IM]] [[Israel Albert Horowitz|I.A. Horowitz]], who took the black pieces in every game.<ref>Chernev 1955, p. 461.</ref>\n\nAdams later wrote ''Simple Chess'', which he revised several times; ''How to Play Chess''; and ''Absolute Chess''. Ultimately giving up on the Bishop's Opening, he switched to the [[Vienna Game]], claiming a win with White after 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Qh5 Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5, a [[List of chess terms#Sharp|sharp]] line that has since been dubbed the [[Vienna Game, Frankenstein\u2013Dracula Variation|Frankenstein\u2013Dracula Variation]].\n\nWhen Adams was also unsuccessful with this variation,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1228755 Adams-H. Lyman, Boston 1946]</ref> he switched to other lines. In 1962, he advocated what he called the ''Adams Gambit'', substituting 6.d4!? for 6.Nb5. He explained his repudiation of 6.Nb5: \"it is antipositional to move a developed piece a second time, and masters have long given it up as hopeless.\"<ref>Adams 1962.</ref>\n\nAdams' \"White to Play and Win\" thesis was widely ridiculed.<ref name=\"Berliner 1999, p. 39\">Berliner 1999, p. 39.</ref> [[Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|Larry Evans]] wrote that \"Mr. Adams and his cronies may be linked to the radical right wing of chess. ... Weaver is not content with such halfway measures as equality. All or nothing\u2014right-wing logic, true to form.\"<ref>Evans 1962.</ref><ref>Evans 1970, pp. 146\u201347 (quoting Evans' above-cited ''Chess Life'' article).</ref>\n\nHowever, IM Hans Berliner, a former [[World Correspondence Chess Championship|world champion]] of [[correspondence chess]], wrote that Adams' \"theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was the first person I met who actually had theories about how chess should be played.\"<ref name=\"Berliner 1999, p. 39\"/> Berliner is himself a controversial figure, who argued in his 1999 book ''The System'', that 1.d4 may win by force for White.<ref>Berliner 1999.</ref>\n\nAlthough Adams was rarely successful at the top levels, his ideas were studied and sometimes adopted by strong players. Future [[World Chess Championship|world champion]] [[Bobby Fischer]] scored notable wins using the [[Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation#Adams Attack|Adams Attack]] against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.h3{{chesspunc|!?}}, preparing the [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] thrust g2\u2013g4<ref>Games 35, 40, and 43 of Fischer's famous book ''[[My 60 Memorable Games]]'' are his wins with 6.h3 against world-class grandmasters [[Samuel Reshevsky]] and [[Miguel Najdorf]], and future grandmaster [[Julio Bolboch\u00e1n]].

Adams and Ethel Weaver Adams. He wrote that he was not directly related to Presidents [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]], but that the Adamses \"in and about Massachusetts are mostly of the same family, deriving from a Henry Adams who landed in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] in 1644\".<ref name=1949bio>[http://boylston-chess-club.blogspot.com/2006/06/weaver-adams-in-his-own-words.html Autobiography of Weaver W.

His mother's side has been traced back to the founding fathers of America.

He wrote a book, ''White to Play and Win'', lived in a White house on White Street, chewed [[antacid]] pills that left the inside of his mouth perpetually White, and raised only white [[chicken]]s that laid white eggs. Predictably, Adams' business was soon no more than a shell.\"<ref>Denker and Parr 1995, p. 170.</ref> [[Harry Golombek]] wrote in 1977 that Adams, whom he described as \"author of ''White to Play and Win'' and a [[sodium bicarbonate]] [[Behavioral addiction|addict]]\", was on Golombek's \"reserves\" list for \"the ten most interesting personages\" from the past 100 years.<ref>[http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter39.html Chess Notes, No. 5215]</ref>\n\nAdams was [[homosexuality|homosexual]], as discussed in his autobiographical article reprinted in ''Chess Pride''.<ref>Johnson, 1998.</ref>\n\n==Notable games==\n{{AN chess|pos=secright}}\n\nHere is a game Adams won using the [[Albin Counter Gambit]], a favorite of his, against [[Master (chess)|National Master]] Erich Marchand, after White made an oversight on move 13.

His greatest competitive achievement was winning the [[U.S. Open Chess Championship|U.S. Open Championship]] in 1948. He played in the [[U.S. Chess Championship|U.S. Championship]] five times.\n\nAdams is most famous for his controversial claim that the first move [[First-move advantage in chess#White wins with 1.e4|1.e4 confers a winning advantage]] upon [[White and Black in chess|White]]. He continually advocated this theory in books and magazine articles from 1939 until shortly before his death. Adams' claim has generally been scorned by the chess world. However, [[International Master]] [[Hans Berliner]] in a 1999 book professed admiration for Adams, and similarly claimed that White may claim a winning advantage, albeit with [[Queen's Pawn Game|1.d4]], not [[wikibooks:Opening theory in chess/1. e4|1.e4]].\n\nAdams did not succeed in showing the validity of his theory in his own tournament and match play. His results suffered because he published his [[List of chess terms#Opening preparation|analysis]] of White's supposed winning lines, thus forfeiting the element of surprise and enabling his opponents to prepare responses to his pet lines. Future [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Bobby Fischer]] used the Adams Attack, the line Adams advocated against the [[Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation|Najdorf Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defense]] (6.h3), with success.\n\n==Playing career==\nWeaver Adams was one of the leading American masters during the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>Grandmaster [[Arnold Denker]] and [[Larry Parr (editor)|Larry Parr]] listed Adams as one of 17 leading American masters during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. Denker and Parr 1995, p. 200.</ref> He played in the [[U.S. Chess Championship|U.S. Championship]] in 1936,<ref>http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1st_1936/28424</ref> 1940,<ref>http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1940/28636</ref> 1944,<ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1021448</ref> 1946,<ref>http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1946/28854</ref> and 1948.<ref>http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1948/28970</ref> He won the Massachusetts State Championship in 1937, 1938, 1941, and 1945.<ref>[http://www.masschess.org/Events/CrossTables/Historical_Information/statechamps_faqs.asp Massachusetts State Champions]</ref> In 1944, he won a master tournament in [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor City]].<ref>Milton L. Hanauer, ''Chess Made Simple'', Doubleday, 1957, p. 180.</ref> He also won the [[Marshall Chess Club]] championship six times, and the New York State championship four times.<ref>Evans, 1970, p. 146 (quoting letter by Adams published in ''[[Chess Life]]'', November 1961).</ref>\n\nAdams' greatest competitive success was winning the 49th U.S. Open, held in [[Baltimore]] in 1948, for which achievement he appeared on the cover of the August 1948 issue of ''Chess Review'' magazine.<ref>''Chess Review'', August 1948, at cover, 4, 6. Also available on DVD (pages 251, 256, 258 in \"Chess Review 1948\" PDF file on DVD).</ref> Adams played in the 1950\u201351 [[Hastings, England|Hastings]] [[Hastings International Chess Congress#Premier .28Christmas Congress.29|Christmas Chess Congress]], but finished 9th out of 10 players with 2\u00bd/9 (two wins, six losses, one draw).<ref>{{Citation|author=Sunnucks, Anne|title=The Encyclopaedia of Chess|year=1970|page=188}}</ref>\n\nGrandmaster [[Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|Larry Evans]] wrote that Adams' \"tournament results were damaged by his dogmatism. Playing under the self-inflicted handicap of arming his opponents with advance knowledge of his 'best' lines, he felt honor-bound to steer straight into them even though his adversary invariably had a [[List of chess terms#Cook|cook]] up his sleeve. By the time Weaver found a refutation and published it, another player found a different cook and so on ''ad infinitum''.\"<ref>Evans, 1970, pp. 146-47.</ref> According to ''Chess Review'', this phenomenon may explain Adams' poor result at Hastings 1950\u201351.<ref>From ''Chess Review'', February 1951, p.&nbsp;35 (also available on DVD):\n\n<blockquote>According to some reports, Adams ran into trouble when he played opening lines which he has often publicized in connection with his theories on 'White to play and win.' These variations, it is said, had been anticipated by his rivals, who had prepared themselves with special analyses. If there is any truth in this account the moral for a chess player would seem to be the same as for a boxer\u2014namely, never to 'telegraph' his favorite blows.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==White to play and win theory==\n{{AN chess|pos=secright}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tleft\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n| | | | | | | | \n| | | | | | | | \n| | | | |pl| | | \n| | | | | | | | \n|pl|pl|pl|pl| |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|After 1.e4, \"White ought to win\", according to Adams.\n}}\nAdams was best known for his books and magazine articles in which he claimed and attempted to prove that White's [[first-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]] is decisive, i.e. that White has a forced win from the starting position. His first and most famous book arguing this, ''White to Play and Win'', was published in 1939. There, Adams claimed that 1.e4 was White's strongest move,<ref>Adams 1939, p. 5.</ref> and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter, \"White ought to win.\"<ref>Adams 1939, p. 10.</ref> If Black responded with 1 ... e5, Adams advocated the [[Bishop's Opening]], 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4.<ref>Adams 1939, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAdams was unable to prove his theory in tournament or match practice. The year after his book was published, he played in the U.S. Open at [[Dallas]], 1940. Ironically, in the finals he did not win a single game as White (three losses and one draw), but won all four of his games as Black.<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Chess at Dallas\n |author=Sturgis, G.\n |work=Chess Review\n |date=October 1940\n |page=146\n}} Also available on DVD (page 154 in \"Chess Review 1940\" PDF file on DVD).</ref> Adams also lost a match to [[International Master|IM]] [[Israel Albert Horowitz|I.A. Horowitz]], who took the black pieces in every game.<ref>Chernev 1955, p. 461.</ref>\n\nAdams later wrote ''Simple Chess'', which he revised several times; ''How to Play Chess''; and ''Absolute Chess''. Ultimately giving up on the Bishop's Opening, he switched to the [[Vienna Game]], claiming a win with White after 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Qh5 Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5, a [[List of chess terms#Sharp|sharp]] line that has since been dubbed the [[Vienna Game, Frankenstein\u2013Dracula Variation|Frankenstein\u2013Dracula Variation]].\n\nWhen Adams was also unsuccessful with this variation,<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1228755 Adams-H. Lyman, Boston 1946]</ref> he switched to other lines. In 1962, he advocated what he called the ''Adams Gambit'', substituting 6.d4!? for 6.Nb5. He explained his repudiation of 6.Nb5: \"it is antipositional to move a developed piece a second time, and masters have long given it up as hopeless.\"<ref>Adams 1962.</ref>\n\nAdams' \"White to Play and Win\" thesis was widely ridiculed.<ref name=\"Berliner 1999, p. 39\">Berliner 1999, p. 39.</ref> [[Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|Larry Evans]] wrote that \"Mr. Adams and his cronies may be linked to the radical right wing of chess. ... Weaver is not content with such halfway measures as equality. All or nothing\u2014right-wing logic, true to form.\"<ref>Evans 1962.</ref><ref>Evans 1970, pp. 146\u201347 (quoting Evans' above-cited ''Chess Life'' article).</ref>\n\nHowever, IM Hans Berliner, a former [[World Correspondence Chess Championship|world champion]] of [[correspondence chess]], wrote that Adams' \"theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was the first person I met who actually had theories about how chess should be played.\"<ref name=\"Berliner 1999, p. 39\"/> Berliner is himself a controversial figure, who argued in his 1999 book ''The System'', that 1.d4 may win by force for White.<ref>Berliner 1999.</ref>\n\nAlthough Adams was rarely successful at the top levels, his ideas were studied and sometimes adopted by strong players. Future [[World Chess Championship|world champion]] [[Bobby Fischer]] scored notable wins using the [[Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation#Adams Attack|Adams Attack]] against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.h3{{chesspunc|!?}}, preparing the [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] thrust g2\u2013g4.<ref>Games 35, 40, and 43 of Fischer's famous book ''[[My 60 Memorable Games]]'' are his wins with 6.h3 against world-class grandmasters [[Samuel Reshevsky]] and [[Miguel Najdorf]], and future grandmaster [[Julio Bolboch\u00e1n]].

Adams and Ethel Weaver Adams. He wrote that he was not directly related to Presidents [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]], but that the Adamses \"in and about Massachusetts are mostly of the same family, deriving from a Henry Adams who landed in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] in 1644\".<ref name=1949bio>[http://boylston-chess-club.blogspot.com/2006/06/weaver-adams-in-his-own-words.html Autobiography of Weaver W.

His mother's side has been traced back to the founding fathers of America. His father's side has not as yet been established.\n\n[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Arnold Denker]] related of Weaver that he was \"a master who inherited a chicken farm and who was \u2013 so to speak \u2013 a White man clear through. He wrote a book, ''White to Play and Win'', lived in a White house on White Street, chewed [[antacid]] pills that left the inside of his mouth perpetually White, and raised only white [[chicken]]s that laid white eggs. Predictably, Adams' business was soon no more than a shell.\"<ref>Denker and Parr 1995, p. 170.</ref> [[Harry Golombek]] wrote in 1977 that Adams, whom he described as \"author of ''White to Play and Win'' and a [[sodium bicarbonate]] [[Behavioral addiction|addict]]\", was on Golombek's \"reserves\" list for \"the ten most interesting personages\" from the past 100 years.<ref>[http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter39.html Chess Notes, No. 5215]</ref>\n\nAdams was [[homosexuality|homosexual]], as discussed in his autobiographical article reprinted in ''Chess Pride''.<ref>Johnson, 1998.</ref>\n\n==Notable games==\n{{AN chess|pos=secright}}\n\nHere is a game Adams won using the [[Albin Counter Gambit]], a favorite of his, against [[Master (chess)|National Master]] Erich Marchand, after White made an oversight on move 13.

He was Kiwi number 136 after playing two tests for New Zealand against Australia in 1919.\n\n==Early Life==\nIt is unclear where Thomas Haddon was born or raised. The first clear indication of him being in Auckland is with his debut for [[City Rovers]] in the opening game of the [[1918 Auckland Rugby League season]]. There are no records of him being born or marrying in [[New Zealand]]. At the start of 1920 he was thought to have moved to [[Australia]] to play rugby league but there are no records of him playing there after being given permission by the New Zealand Rugby League Council.\n\n==Playing career==\n===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand===\nTom Haddon first appeared for [[City Rovers]] in 1918 in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition, playing for them against [[Grafton Athletic]] in a preliminary round to open the season <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Northern Union/Teams for Saturday/North Shore\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLIX, Issue 99\n| date = 1918-04-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19180426.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. He scored a try in a Round 3 match against Grafton Athletic at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] where he \u201creceived a cross-kick and scored underneath the posts\u201d with City going on to win 11-10 <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Matches/Newton V Ponsonby/Grafton V City\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16860\n| date = 1918-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180527.2.62.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.

During the war the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had decided to largely cease its representative program. Haddon\u2019s debut was against [[Canterbury rugby league team]] and it resulted in a comfortable 45-9 victory to Auckland with Haddon scoring twice. The match was played in front of 10,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nIn [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Haddon was again playing for City and in a round two match against [[North Shore Albions]] on the Devonport Domain in front of 500 spectators <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championships Continue/City V North Shore\n| page =5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVI| issue=17158\n| date = 1919-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190512.2.21.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>. On August 9, Haddon played for Auckland in a match against [[Hawke's Bay rugby league team|Hawke's Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] before a crowd of 9,000.

On September 6, Tom Haddon became Kiwi number 136 when he played lock in front of 24,300 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]].

It is however unclear as to where he went and if he played rugby league over the following years.\n\n===North Shore Albions===\nIn 1925 Haddon resumed playing rugby league in Auckland, this time however he was to represent the [[North Shore Albions]] who at this time were in fact named [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] after amalgamating with the Sunnyside League Football Club at the start of the 1920 season <ref>{{cite news \n| title =Two Clubs Amalgamate\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVII| issue=17436\n| date = 1920-03-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200405.2.100\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. The first mention of him in a Devonport uniform is in a match against his old [[City Rovers]] team at [[Carlaw Park]] where he scored a try <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Code/Another Great Game/City Beat Devonport\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 133,\n| date = 1925-06-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250608.2.147\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The day was significant for other reasons as the teams stood in silence before the kick off out of respect for [[Bill Stormont]] (Kiwi #140) who had died two days earlier. In a July match Haddon scored a try in front of 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park against [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Devonport won but not before Haddon was sent off along with Marist\u2019s New Zealand international [[Andrew O'Brien (rugby league)|Jim O'Brien]] after a \u201crough-up\u201d between the two. Devonport won the match 19-11 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Code/Devonport\u2019s Day Out/Marists v Devonport\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 145\n| date = 1925-06-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250622.2.108\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nAfter a July match between Ponsonby and Devonport it was said of Haddon \u201cit is surprising how youth sticks to some footballers. On Saturday the veteran \u2026 was easily Devonport\u2019s best forward. He showed a lot of pace and some of the form displayed several years ago when playing for [[City Rovers|City]]\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football Notes and Comments/The North Shore Players\n| page =6 \n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19069\n| date = 1925-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250714.2.9.2\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. Then against Athletic \u201cHaddon, following up fast secured, and beating several Athletic players, scored behind the posts with three men hanging on to him\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Club Competitions/Athletic v Devonport\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 169\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250720.2.137\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. He scored a second try later in the match after a \u201cpassing rush\u201d in which all the Devonport players took part. Haddon\u2019s final ever senior league match was in a Roope Rooster semi final loss to his old City Rovers team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/City Defeat Devonport\n| page = 14\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII\n| date = 1925-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250817.2.136\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926, 27, 28, and again in 1934 Haddon played in several veteran player exhibition matches. On October 30, 1926 Haddon made an appearance in an end of season game played between well known league veterans at Carlaw Park. Haddon was representing early New Zealand rugby league legends [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\u2019s team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = End of Season Games/Veteran Players in Action\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19473\n| date = 1926-11-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19261101.2.138\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The match finished 10-10 and featured the likes of [[Eric Bennett (New Zealand)|Eric Bennett]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], and [[Thomas McClymont]]. In September, 1927 he was chosen in a Devonport United veteran team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Devonport United\n| page = 11\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVIII, Issue 207\n| date = 1927-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19270902.2.138.21\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. Then again in October he played for [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against \u201cShaver\u201d Hargreaves team. The match featured [[Ernie Asher]], [[Jim Rukutai]], [[Thomas McClymont]], [[Dougie McGregor]], [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|Billy Wynyard]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], and [[Bert Laing]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Relief of Unemployed\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVIII, Issue 248\n| date = 1927-10-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19271020.2.150\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>.

It is however unclear as to where he went and if he played rugby league over the following years.\n\n===North Shore Albions===\nIn 1925 Haddon resumed playing rugby league in Auckland, this time however he was to represent the [[North Shore Albions]] who at this time were in fact named [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] after amalgamating with the Sunnyside League Football Club at the start of the 1920 season <ref>{{cite news \n| title =Two Clubs Amalgamate\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVII| issue=17436\n| date = 1920-03-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200405.2.100\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.

The day was significant for other reasons as the teams stood in silence before the kick off out of respect for [[Bill Stormont]] (Kiwi #140) who had died two days earlier. In a July match Haddon scored a try in front of 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park against [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Devonport won but not before Haddon was sent off along with Marist\u2019s New Zealand international [[Andrew O\u2019Brien (rugby league)|Jim O\u2019Brien]] after a \u201crough-up\u201d between the two.

On Saturday the veteran \u2026 was easily Devonport\u2019s best forward.

He scored a second try later in the match after a \u201cpassing rush\u201d in which all the Devonport players took part.

On October 30, 1926 Haddon made an appearance in an end of season game played between well known league veterans at Carlaw Park. Haddon was representing early New Zealand rugby league legends [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\u2019s team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = End of Season Games/Veteran Players in Action\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19473\n| date = 1926-11-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19261101.2.138\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The match finished 10-10 and featured the likes of [[Eric Bennett (New Zealand)|Eric Bennett]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], and [[Thomas McClymont]].

Used in this way, they are referred to as a '''pocket handkerchief''' or '''pocket square'''. A traditional pocket square will have the hem rolled, contrary to handkerchiefs.\n\nThe trend of pocket squares as a fashion accessory really started during the 1920s, and continued until the 1960s. During that period, actors such as [[Cary Grant]], [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Gary Cooper]] wore them regularly. The pocket square subsequently fell into disuse until the late 2000s when it made a comeback thanks in part to popular television shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]''.\n\nPocket squares are usually made in fabrics such as silk, cotton, linen or wool.\n\nAs a visible fashion item there are a wide variety of ways to fold a pocket square, ranging from the austere to the flamboyant:\n* The Presidential, or Flat Fold, perhaps the simplest, is folded at right angles to fit in the pocket.\n* The Winged Puff, a simple and elegant fold.\n* The Puff or the [[Gary Cooper|Cooper]] is simply shaped into a round puff.\n* The Reverse Puff, or The Crown Fold, is like the Puff, except with the puff inside and the points out, like petals.\n* The Westo Four Point fold, the quickest way to achieve a four-point fold effect.\n* The TV Fold looks similar but is folded diagonally with the point inside the pocket.\n* The One-point Fold is folded diagonally with the point showing.\n* The Two-point Fold is folded off-center so the two points do not completely overlap.\n* The Three-point Fold is first folded into a triangle, then the corners are folded up and across to make three points.\n* The Four-point Fold is an off-center version of the Three-point Fold.\n* The [[James Cagney|Cagney]] is basically a backwards version of the Four-point Fold.\n* The [[Fred Astaire|Astaire]] is a puff with a point on either side.\n* The Straight Shell is pleated and then folded over to give the appearance of nested shells.\n* The Diagonal Shell is pleated diagonally and then folded.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Napkin]]\n* [[Sachet (scented bag)|Sachet]]\n* [[Facial tissue]]\n* [[Antimacassar]]\n* [[Dudou]], sometimes described as a handkerchief blouse\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Handkerchiefs}}\n\n[[Category:Personal hygiene products]]\n[[Category:Fashion accessories]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Piece of cloth for personal use}}\n{{mi|\n {{original research|date=February 2017}}\n {{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}\n}}\n[[Image:Handkerchief.jpg|right|thumb|[[Linen]] handkerchief]]\n\nA '''handkerchief''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u00e6|\u014b|k|\u0259r|t\u0283|\u026a|f}}; also called a '''hankie''' or, historically, a '''handkercher''') is a form of a [[kerchief]] or bandanna, typically a hemmed square of thin [[fabric]] which can be carried in the [[pocket]] or [[handbag]], and which is intended for personal [[hygiene]] purposes such as wiping one's [[hand]]s or face, or [[nose-blowing|blowing one's nose]].

A traditional pocket square will have the hem rolled, contrary to handkerchiefs.\n\nThe trend of pocket squares as a fashion accessory really started during the 1920s, and continued until the 1960s. During that period, actors such as [[Cary Grant]], [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Gary Cooper]] wore them regularly. The pocket square subsequently fell into disuse until the late 2000s when it made a comeback thanks in part to popular television shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]''.\n\nPocket squares are usually made in fabrics such as silk, cotton, linen or wool.\n\nAs a visible fashion item there are a wide variety of ways to fold a pocket square, ranging from the austere to the flamboyant:\n* The Presidential, or Flat Fold, perhaps the simplest, is folded at right angles to fit in the pocket.\n* The Winged Puff, a simple and elegant fold.\n* The Puff or the [[Gary Cooper|Cooper]] is simply shaped into a round puff.\n* The Reverse Puff, or The Crown Fold, is like the Puff, except with the puff inside and the points out, like petals.\n* The Westo Four Point fold, the quickest way to achieve a four-point fold effect.\n* The TV Fold looks similar but is folded diagonally with the point inside the pocket.\n* The One-point Fold is folded diagonally with the point showing.\n* The Two-point Fold is folded off-center so the two points do not completely overlap.\n* The Three-point Fold is first folded into a triangle, then the corners are folded up and across to make three points.\n* The Four-point Fold is an off-center version of the Three-point Fold.\n* The [[James Cagney|Cagney]] is basically a backwards version of the Four-point Fold.\n* The [[Fred Astaire|Astaire]] is a puff with a point on either side.\n* The Straight Shell is pleated and then folded over to give the appearance of nested shells.\n* The Diagonal Shell is pleated diagonally and then folded.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Napkin]]\n* [[Sachet (scented bag)|Sachet]]\n* [[Facial tissue]]\n* [[Antimacassar]]\n* [[Dudou]], sometimes described as a handkerchief blouse\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Handkerchiefs}}\n\n[[Category:Personal hygiene products]]\n[[Category:Fashion accessories]]\n", "name_user": "Arunuflex", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief"}

Published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, ''Don Quixote'' is the most influential work of literature from the [[Spanish Golden Age]] and the entire Spanish literary canon. A founding work of [[Western literature]], it is often labeled \"the first modern [[novel]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes|title=The knight in the mirror|author=Harold Bloom|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2003|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref> and is sometimes considered the best literary work ever written.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1972609.stm|title=Don Quixote gets authors' votes|website=[[BBC News]]|date=7 May 2002|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Angelique|first=Chrisafis|title=Don Quixote is the world's best book say the world's top authors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/08/humanities.books|access-date=13 October 2012|location=London|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe plot revolves around the adventures of a noble ([[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]]) from [[La Mancha]] named Alonso Quixano, who reads so many [[chivalric romance]]s that he loses his mind and decides to become a [[knight-errant]] (''caballero andante'') to revive [[chivalry]] and serve his nation, under the name ''Don Quixote de la Mancha''. He recruits a simple farmer, [[Sancho Panza]], as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical monologues on [[knighthood]], already considered old-fashioned at the time. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story.\n\nThe book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1844), [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884), and [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1897), as well as the word ''[[Quixotism|quixotic]]'' and the epithet ''[[Lothario]]''; the latter refers to a character in \"[[El curioso impertinente]]\" (\"The Impertinently Curious Man\"), an intercalated story that appears in Part One, chapters 33\u201335. The 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] cited ''Don Quixote'' as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]]'', and ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship|Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite book|last = Schopenhauer|first = Arthur|title = The Art of Literature|work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20150504103459/http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 May 2015 | accessdate = 22 March 2015|date = January 2004}}</ref>\n\nWhen first published, ''Don Quixote'' was usually interpreted as a [[comic novel]]. After the [[French Revolution]], it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting. In the 19th century, it was seen as a social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and [[nobility]] are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Don Quijote Illustration by Gustave Dore VII.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] depicting the famous windmill scene]]\n\nCervantes wrote that the first chapters were taken from \"the archives of La Mancha\", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by the [[Moors|Moorish]] author [[Cide Hamete Benengeli]]. This [[metafiction]]al trick appears to give a greater credibility to the text, implying that Don Quixote is a real character and that the events related truly occurred several decades prior to the recording of this account. However, it was also common practice in that era for fictional works to make some pretense of being factual, such as the common opening line of fairy tales \"[[Once upon a time]] in a land far away...\".\n\nIn the course of their travels, the protagonists meet innkeepers, prostitutes, goat-herders, soldiers, priests, escaped convicts and scorned lovers. The aforementioned characters sometimes tell tales that incorporate events from the real world, like the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Maynila]] or battles in the [[Eighty Years' War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fnac.com/livre-numerique/a13413583/Miguel-De-Cervantes-Don-Quixote|author=Miguel de Cervantes|title=Don Quixote|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}} Their encounters are magnified by Don Quixote's imagination into chivalrous quests. Don Quixote's tendency to intervene violently in matters irrelevant to himself, and his habit of not paying debts, result in privations, injuries, and humiliations (with Sancho often the victim). Finally, Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The narrator hints that there was a third quest, but says that records of it have been lost.\n\n===Part 1===\n\n====The First Sally (Chapters 1\u20135)====\nAlonso Quixano, the protagonist of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of [[La Mancha]] with his niece and housekeeper, as well as a boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a rational man, in keeping with the [[humorism|humoral]] physiology theory  of the time, not sleeping adequately\u2014because he was reading\u2014has caused his brain to dry. Quixano's temperament is thus [[choleric]], the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger<ref>Otis H. Green. \"El Ingenioso Hidalgo\", ''[[Hispanic Review]]'' 25 (1957), 175\u2013193.</ref> and believes every word of these fictional books of chivalry to be true.\n\nImitating the protagonists of these books, he decides to become a [[knight errant]] in search of adventure. To these ends, he dons an old suit of [[armor]], renames himself \"Don Quixote\", names his exhausted horse \"[[Rocinante]]\", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo, a neighboring farm girl, as his [[Courtly love|lady love]], renaming her [[Dulcinea|Dulcinea del Toboso]], while she knows nothing of this. Expecting to become famous quickly, he arrives at an [[inn]], which he believes to be a [[castle]], calls the prostitutes he meets \"ladies\" (''doncellas''), and demands that the innkeeper, who he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. He spends the night holding [[vigil]] over his armor and becomes involved in a fight with [[Arriero|muleteers]] who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. In a pretended ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.\n\nDon Quixote next \"frees\" a young boy named Andres who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master, and makes his master swear to treat the boy fairly, but the boy's beating is continued (and in fact redoubled) as soon as Quixote leaves. Don Quixote then encounters traders from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], who \"insult\" the imaginary Dulcinea. He attacks them, only to be severely beaten and left on the side of the road, and is returned to his home by a neighboring peasant.\n\n====Destruction of Don Quixote's library (Chapters 6 and 7)====\nWhile Don Quixote is unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish [[curate]], and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of [[high comedy]]: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel ''[[La Galatea]]'' is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance ''Felixmarte de Hyrcania'' is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the [[The library of Don Quixote|library]], later telling Don Quixote that it was the action of a wizard (''encantador'').\n\n====The Second Sally====\nAfter a short period of feigning health, Don Quixote requests his neighbour, Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship (''\u00ednsula''). Sancho is a poor and simple farmer but more practical than the head-in-the-clouds Don Quixote and agrees to the offer, sneaking away with Don Quixote in the early dawn. It is here that their famous adventures begin, starting with Don Quixote's attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants.\n\nThe two next encounter two Benedictine friars travelling on the road ahead of a lady in a carriage. The friars are not travelling with the lady, but happen to be travelling on the same road.  Don Quixote takes the [[friar]]s to be enchanters who hold the lady captive, knocks a friar from his horse, and is challenged by an armed [[Basque people|Basque]] traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow from the carriage to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. Cervantes chooses this point, in the middle of the battle, to say that his source ends here. Soon, however, he resumes Don Quixote's adventures after a story about finding Arabic notebooks containing the rest of the story by Cid Hamet Ben Engeli. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to \"surrender\" to Don Quixote.\n\n[[File:Quijote1y2.jpg|thumb|First editions of the first and second part]]\n\n===== The Pastoral Peregrinations (Chapters 11\u201315) =====\nSancho and Don Quixote fall in with a group of goat herders. Don Quixote tells Sancho and the goat herders about the \"Golden Age\" of man, in which property does not exist and men live in peace. The goatherders invite the Knight and Sancho to the funeral of Gris\u00f3stomo, a former student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels (paralleling Don Quixote's decision to become a knight), seeking the shepherdess Marcela. At the funeral Marcela appears, vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by Gris\u00f3stomo, and claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich\u00e9s. She disappears into the woods, and Don Quixote and Sancho follow. Ultimately giving up, the two dismount by a pond to rest. Some [[Galician people|Galicians]] arrive to water their ponies, and Rocinante (Don Quixote's horse) attempts to mate with the ponies. The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him, whereupon Don Quixote tries to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho, leaving them in great pain.\n\n===== The inn (Chapters 16\u201317) =====\nAfter escaping the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride to a nearby inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls \"the balm of Fierabras\", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.\n\n===== The galley slaves and Cardenio (Chapters 19\u201324) =====\n[[File:Don Quijote and Sancho Panza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Don Quixote de la Mancha and Sancho Panza'', 1863, by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\nAfter Don Quixote has adventures involving a dead body, a helmet, and freeing a group of [[galley slave]]s, he and Sancho wander into the [[Sierra Morena]] and there encounter the dejected [[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]. Cardenio relates the first part of his [[The History of Cardenio#Synopsis of \"Cardenio\", the episode in the novel Don Quixote|story]], in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend Lucinda, and is hired as the companion to the Duke's son, leading to his friendship with the Duke's younger son, Don Fernando. Cardenio confides in Don Fernando his love for Lucinda and the delays in their engagement, caused by Cardenio's desire to keep with tradition. After reading Cardenio's poems praising Lucinda, Don Fernando falls in love with her. Don Quixote interrupts when Cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels. They get into a fight, ending with Cardenio beating all of them and walking away to the mountains.\n\n===== The priest, the barber, and Dorotea (Chapters 25\u201331) =====\nQuixote pines for Dulcinea, imitating Cardenio. Quixote sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village and brings them to Quixote. The priest and barber make plans with Sancho to trick Don Quixote to come home. They get the help of Dorotea, a woman whom they discover in the forest, that has been deceived by Don Fernando with promises of love and marriage. She pretends that she is the Princess Micomicona and desperate to get Quixote's help. Quixote runs into Andres, who insults his incompetence.\n\n===== Return to the inn (Chapters 32\u201342) =====\nConvinced that he is on a quest to return princess Miconiconia to the throne of her kingdom, Quixote and the group return to the previous inn where the priest tells the story of Anselmo ([[Lothario#The Man Who Was Recklessly Curious|The Impertinentely Curious Man]]) while Quixote, sleepwalking, battles with wineskins that he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomiconia's kingdom. A stranger arrives at the inn accompanying a young woman. The stranger is revealed to be Don Fernando, and the young woman Lucinda. Dorotea is reunited with Don Fernando and Cardenio with Lucinda. A captive from Moorish lands arrives and is asked to tell the story of his life. A judge arrives, and it is found that the captive is his long-lost brother, and the two are reunited.\n\n===== The ending (Chapters 45\u201352) =====\nAn officer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] has a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley slaves. The priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote's insanity. The officer agrees, and Quixote is locked in a cage and made to think that it is an enchantment and that there is a prophecy of his heroic return home. While traveling, the group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, and he is finally brought home. The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.\n\n===Part 2===\n[[File:Don Quixote Illustration I.jpg|thumb|Illustration to ''The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha''. Volume II.]]\n\nAlthough the two parts are now published as a single work, ''Don Quixote, Part Two'' was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. While ''Part One'' was mostly farcical, the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception.\n\n''Part Two'' of ''Don Quixote'' explores the concept of a character understanding that he is written about, an idea much explored in the 20th century. As ''Part Two'' begins, it is assumed that the literate classes of Spain have all read the first part of the story. Cervantes' [[meta-fiction]]al device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of ''Part One'', as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two.\n\n====The Third Sally====\nWhen strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of ''Part One'') that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.\n\nSancho later gets his comeuppance for this when, as part of one of the Duke and Duchess's pranks, the two are led to believe that the only method to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the Duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets a governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler although this ends in humiliation as well. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.\n\nThe lengthy untold \"history\" of Don Quixote's adventures in knight-errantry comes to a close after his battle with the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Don Quixote's hometown who had previously posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach in [[Barcelona]], in which the reader finds him conquered. Bound by the rules of chivalry, Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror: here, it is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (in which he may be cured of his madness). He and Sancho undergo one more prank by the Duke and Duchess before setting off.\n\nUpon returning to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Quixano (his proper name) only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[Harold Bloom]] says ''Don Quixote'' is the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war with Freud's reality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes The Knight in the Mirror] a 2003 book report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about [[Harold Bloom]]'s book.</ref>\n\n[[Edith Grossman]], who wrote and published a highly acclaimed English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:<blockquote>The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muOZ6WdAg3o Edith Grossman about Don Quixote as tragedy and comedy] a discussion held in New York City on 5 February 2009 by [[Words Without Borders]] (YouTube)</ref></blockquote>\n\nJonathan Shockley has placed the novel in the context of [[Terror Management Theory]], claiming that the figure of Don Quixote represents the hidden essence of human culture: the centrality of heroic madness and its related death anxiety in all people. The flimsy, delusional (and evil-causing) nature of the things that grant humans conviction and self-aggrandizement. And the ironic (and ultimately tragic) need to acquire this conviction and self-aggrandizement to experience the goodness, richness and reality of life.\n\n==Themes==\n{{See also|List of works influenced by Don Quixote}}\n[[File:Don Quichotte Honor\u00e9 Daumier.jpg|thumb|right|''Don Quixote'' by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] (1868)]]\n\nThe novel's structure is [[episode|episodic]] in form. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, as ''ingenioso'' (Spanish) means \"quick with inventiveness\",<ref>{{lang|es|ingenio <sup>'''1'''</sup>}}, ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola''</ref> marking the transition of modern literature from [[Classical unities|dramatic]] to thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.\n\nAlthough [[burlesque]] on the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.\n\nEven faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire of [[orthodoxy]], veracity and even nationalism. In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped move beyond the narrow literary conventions of the [[chivalric romance]] literature that he [[Parody|spoofed]], which consists of straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to the [[Chivalry|knightly virtues]] of the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word ''[[Quixotism|quixotic]]'' was quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed, [[Rocinante]], are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase \"[[tilting at windmills]]\" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.\n\nIt stands in a unique position between medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]] and the modern novel. The former consist of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through \"having read his adventures\", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more \"Alonso Quixano the Good\".\n\n==Background==\n\n===Sources===\nSources for ''Don Quixote'' include the Castilian novel ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, is ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', which the priest describes in Chapter VI of ''Quixote'' as \"the best book in the world.\" (However, the sense in which it was \"best\" is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called \"the most difficult passage of ''Don Quixote''\".)\nThe scene of the book burning gives us an excellent list of Cervantes' likes and dislikes about literature.\n\nCervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poem ''[[Orlando furioso]]''. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet of [[Mambrino]], an episode from Canto I of ''Orlando'', and itself a reference to [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s ''[[Orlando innamorato]]''.<ref>''Don Quijote de la Mancha'', Miguel de Cervantes, Edici\u00f3n de Florencio Sevilla Arroyo, \u00c1rea 2002 p. 161</ref> The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 of ''Orlando'', regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.<ref>\"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes, translated and annotated by Edith Grossman, p. 272</ref>\n\nAnother important source appears to have been Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale \"The Curious Impertinent\" in chapter 35 of the first part of ''Don Quixote'' is a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program.<ref>See chapter 2 of E.

About September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitled ''Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate) [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]], of [[Tordesillas]]'', was published in [[Tarragona]] by an unidentified [[Aragon]]ese who was an admirer of [[Lope de Vega]], rival of Cervantes.<ref name=\"Ei\">{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Eisenberg|title=Cervantes, Lope and Avellaneda|work= Estudios cervantinos|location= Barcelona: Sirmio|year= 1991|pages= 119\u201341|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/hisp/56826142007993728511191/p0000002.htm#I_7_.}}</ref> It was translated into [[English language|English]] by William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.\n\nSome modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that ''Cervantes'' encountered it, which may have been much earlier.\n\nAvellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who not surprisingly took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes' ''Segunda Parte'' lend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly. \n\nIn his introduction to ''The Portable Cervantes'', [[Samuel Putnam]], a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version \"one of the most disgraceful performances in history\".<ref>Cervantes, Miguel, [https://archive.org/details/portablecervante0000cerv <!-- quote=putnam portable cervantes. --> ''The Portable Cervantes''], ed.

By [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\n''Don Quixote, Part One'' contains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the [[picaresque]] figures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is \"El Curioso Impertinente\" (the impertinently curious man), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of a [[Florence|Florentine]] nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity, and talks his close friend [[Lothario]] into attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.\n\nIn ''Part Two'', the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions in ''Part One'' and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, \"Part Two\" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.\n\nSeveral abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.<ref>An example is ''The Portable Cervantes'' (New York: Viking Penguin, 1949), which contains an abridged version of the Samuel Putnam translation.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\n===Spelling and pronunciation===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2013}}\nCervantes wrote his work in early modern Spanish, heavily borrowing from [[Old Spanish language|Old Castilian]], the medieval form of the language. The language of ''Don Quixote'', although still containing [[archaisms]], is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of the ''[[Poema de mio Cid]]'', a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes' language as [[Middle English]] is from [[Modern English]]. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.\n\nIn ''Don Quixote'', there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource \u2013 he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times, when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.)\n\nIn Old Castilian, the letter ''x'' represented the sound written ''sh'' in modern English, so the name was originally pronounced {{IPA-es|ki\u02c8\u0283ote|}}. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, a [[sound change]] caused it to be pronounced with a [[voiceless velar fricative]] sound (like the [[Scots language|Scottish]] or German ''ch''), and today the Spanish pronunciation of \"Quixote\" is {{IPA-es|ki\u02c8xote|}}. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such as [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[French language|French]], where it is pronounced with a \"sh\" or \"ch\" sound; the French opera ''[[Don Quichotte]]'' is one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.\n\nToday, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation of ''Quixote'' (''Quijote''), as {{IPAc-en|k|i\u02d0|\u02c8|h|o\u028a|t|i|}},<ref name=\"oed\"/> although the traditional English [[spelling pronunciation|spelling-based pronunciation]] with the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|\u0259|t|}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|o\u028a|t|}}. In [[Australian English]], the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|\u0259|t|}} until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to \"anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=P.

Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:\n\n{{quote|text=Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer.|sign=Miguel de Cervantes|source=''Don Quixote'', Volume II, Chapter 74}}\n\nIn 2004, a multidisciplinary team of academics from [[Complutense University]], led by Francisco Parra Luna, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Nieto, and Santiago Petschen Verdaguer, deduced that the village was that of [[Villanueva de los Infantes, Ciudad Real|Villanueva de los Infantes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article404423.ece|title=To Quixote's village at the speed of a nag|newspaper=Times Online | location=London}}</ref> Their findings were published in a paper titled ''\"'El Quijote' como un sistema de distancias/tiempos: hacia la localizaci\u00f3n del lugar de la Mancha\"'', which was later published as a book: ''El enigma resuelto del Quijote''.

Cervantes was friend of the family Villase\u00f1or, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acu\u00f1a. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road from [[El Toboso]] to [[Miguel Esteban]] in 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of \"hidalgo\", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2014/12/07/54830651268e3e242b8b4576.html|title=Don Quijote era Acu\u00f1a el Procurador|newspaper=El Mundo | location=Madrid}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2014/12/07/actualidad/1417983722_234613.html|title=Don Quijote de La Mancha: \u00bfrealidad o ficci\u00f3n?|newspaper=El Pa\u00eds | location=Madrid}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I suspect that in ''Don Quixote'', it does not rain a single time.

New Directions Publishing, 2013. ISBN 9780811218757. P. 15.</ref>}}\n\n===Language===\nBecause of its widespread influence, ''Don Quixote'' also helped cement the modern Spanish language. The opening sentence of the book created a classic Spanish clich\u00e9 with the phrase {{lang|es| \"de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme\" }} (\"whose name I do not wish to recall\"): {{lang|es| \"En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no hace mucho tiempo que viv\u00eda un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, roc\u00edn flaco y galgo corredor.\"}} (\"In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to recall, there lived, not very long ago, one of those gentlemen with a lance in the lance-rack, an ancient shield, a skinny old horse, and a fast greyhound.\")\n\nThe novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming in ''Don Quixote'' makes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the names ''[[Rocinante]]''<ref>{{lang|es|rocinante}}: deriv. of ''roc\u00edn'', work horse; colloq., brusque labourer; rough, unkempt man. ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.</ref> (a reversal) and ''[[Dulcinea]]'' (an allusion to illusion), and the word {{lang|es|quixote}} itself, possibly a pun on {{lang|es|quijada}} (jaw) but certainly {{lang|es|cuixot}} (Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse's [[rump (animal)|rump]].<ref>quijote<sup>'''1.2'''</sup>: rump or haunch. ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.''</ref>\n\nAs a military term, the word ''quijote'' refers to ''[[cuisses]]'', part of a full suit of [[plate armour]] protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix ''-ote'' denotes the augmentative\u2014for example, ''grande'' means large, but ''grandote'' means extra large. Following this example, ''Quixote'' would suggest 'The Great Quijano', a play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.\n\n''La Mancha'' is a region of Spain, but ''mancha'' (Spanish word) means spot, mark, stain. Translators such as [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] have declared La Mancha to be one of the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one would imagine as the home of a courageous knight.\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:Illustration to Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration to ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' by Miguel de Cervantes (the edition translated by Charles Jarvis)]]\n[[File:Don Quixote attacking a puppet theatre.jpg|thumb|upright|Don Quixote.

''Don Quixote'' had been growing in favour, and its author's name was now known beyond the [[Pyrenees]].

In 1607, an edition was printed in [[Brussels]]. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608.

Historically, Cervantes' work has been said to have \"smiled [[Spanish chivalry|Spain's chivalry]] away\", suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prestage|first=Edgar| title=Chivalry|year=1928|page=110}}</ref>\n\n===English editions in translation===\n[[File:Gustave Dor\u00e9 - Miguel de Cervantes - Don Quixote - Part 1 - Chapter 1 - Plate 1 \"A world of disorderly notions, picked out of his books, crowded into his imagination\".jpg|thumb|upright|Don Quixote goes mad from his reading of books of chivalry.

The expression is derived from ''Don Quixote'', and the word \"tilt\" in this context comes from [[jousting]].\n\nThe phrase is sometimes used to describe either confrontations where adversaries are incorrectly perceived, or courses of action that are based on misinterpreted or misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications. It may also connote an importune, unfounded, and vain effort against adversaries real or imagined.<ref name=\"Ammer\">{{cite book |url=http://idioms.yourdictionary.com/tilt-at-windmills |title=What does \"tilt at windmills\" mean? |work=The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of Idioms |first1=Christine |last1=Ammer |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |date=2003 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=0618249532 |accessdate=May 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415022333/http://idioms.yourdictionary.com/tilt-at-windmills |archivedate=April 15, 2013 }} {{ISBN|978-0618249534}}</ref>\n\n==List of English translations==\n\nReviewing the English translations as a whole, Daniel Eisenberg stated that there is no one translation ideal for every purpose, but expressed a preference for those of Putnam and the revision of Ormsby's translation by Douglas and Jones.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=The Text of Don Quixote as Seen by its Modern English Translators\n|journal=[[Cervantes (journal of the Cervantes Society of America)]]\n|volume=26\n|year=2005\n|pages=103\u2013126\n|url=https://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/csa/artics-f06/eisenbergsf06.pdf}}</ref>\n\n# [[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]] (1612 & 1620).\n# [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (1687) \u2013 the nephew of [[John Milton]]\n# [[Captain]] [[John Stevens (translator)|John Stevens]] (1700) (revision of [[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]])\n# [[Pierre Antoine Motteux]] (1700)\n# Ned Ward (1700) \u2013 (The) Life & Notable Adventures of Don Quixote merrily translated into Hudibrastic Verse\n# [[John Ozell]] (1719) (revision of Pierre Antoine Motteux)\n# [[Charles Jervas]] (1742)\n# [[Tobias Smollett]] (1755) (revision of [[Charles Jervas]])\n# [[George Kelly (translator)|George Kelly]] (1769) (considered as another revision of Pierre Antoine Motteux)\n# Charles Henry Wilmot (1774)\n# [[Mary Smirke]] with engravings by [[Robert Smirke (painter)|Robert Smirke]] (1818)\n# [[Alexander James Duffield]] (1881)\n# [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] (1885) (pdf format: [https://archive.org/stream/TheIngeniousGentlemanDonQuixoteOfLaMancha/The%20Ingenious%20Gentleman%20Don%20Quixote%20of%20La%20Mancha#mode/2up Don Quixote])\n# [[Henry Edward Watts]] (1888)\n# Robinson Smith (1910)\n# [[Samuel Putnam]] (1949)\n# [[J.

Published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, ''Don Quixote'' is the most influential work of literature from the [[Spanish Golden Age]] and the entire Spanish literary canon. A founding work of [[Western literature]], it is often labeled \"the first modern [[novel]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes|title=The knight in the mirror|author=Harold Bloom|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2003|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref> and is sometimes considered the best literary work ever written.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1972609.stm|title=Don Quixote gets authors' votes|website=[[BBC News]]|date=7 May 2002|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Angelique|first=Chrisafis|title=Don Quixote is the world's best book say the world's top authors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/08/humanities.books|access-date=13 October 2012|location=London|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe plot revolves around the adventures of a noble ([[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]]) from [[La Mancha]] named Alonso Quixano, who reads so many [[chivalric romance]]s that he loses his mind and decides to become a [[knight-errant]] (''caballero andante'') to revive [[chivalry]] and serve his nation, under the name ''Don Quixote de la Mancha''. He recruits a simple farmer, [[Sancho Panza]], as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical monologues on [[knighthood]], already considered old-fashioned at the time. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story.\n\nThe book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1844), [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884), and [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1897), as well as the word ''[[Quixotism|quixotic]]'' and the epithet ''[[Lothario]]''; the latter refers to a character in \"[[El curioso impertinente]]\" (\"The Impertinently Curious Man\"), an intercalated story that appears in Part One, chapters 33\u201335. The 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] cited ''Don Quixote'' as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse]]'', and ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship|Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite book|last = Schopenhauer|first = Arthur|title = The Art of Literature|work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20150504103459/http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 May 2015 | accessdate = 22 March 2015|date = January 2004}}</ref>\n\nWhen first published, ''Don Quixote'' was usually interpreted as a [[comic novel]]. After the [[French Revolution]], it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting. In the 19th century, it was seen as a social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and [[nobility]] are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Don Quijote Illustration by Gustave Dore VII.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] depicting the famous windmill scene]]\n\nCervantes wrote that the first chapters were taken from \"the archives of La Mancha\", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by the [[Moors|Moorish]] author [[Cide Hamete Benengeli]]. This [[metafiction]]al trick appears to give a greater credibility to the text, implying that Don Quixote is a real character and that the events related truly occurred several decades prior to the recording of this account. However, it was also common practice in that era for fictional works to make some pretense of being factual, such as the common opening line of fairy tales \"[[Once upon a time]] in a land far away...\".\n\nIn the course of their travels, the protagonists meet innkeepers, prostitutes, goat-herders, soldiers, priests, escaped convicts and scorned lovers. The aforementioned characters sometimes tell tales that incorporate events from the real world, like the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Maynila]] or battles in the [[Eighty Years' War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fnac.com/livre-numerique/a13413583/Miguel-De-Cervantes-Don-Quixote|author=Miguel de Cervantes|title=Don Quixote|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}} Their encounters are magnified by Don Quixote's imagination into chivalrous quests. Don Quixote's tendency to intervene violently in matters irrelevant to himself, and his habit of not paying debts, result in privations, injuries, and humiliations (with Sancho often the victim). Finally, Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The narrator hints that there was a third quest, but says that records of it have been lost.\n\n===Part 1===\n\n====The First Sally (Chapters 1\u20135)====\nAlonso Quixano, the protagonist of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of [[La Mancha]] with his niece and housekeeper, as well as a boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a rational man, in keeping with the [[humorism|humoral]] physiology theory  of the time, not sleeping adequately\u2014because he was reading\u2014has caused his brain to dry. Quixano's temperament is thus [[choleric]], the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger<ref>Otis H. Green. \"El Ingenioso Hidalgo\", ''[[Hispanic Review]]'' 25 (1957), 175\u2013193.</ref> and believes every word of these fictional books of chivalry to be true.\n\nImitating the protagonists of these books, he decides to become a [[knight errant]] in search of adventure. To these ends, he dons an old suit of [[armor]], renames himself \"Don Quixote\", names his exhausted horse \"[[Rocinante]]\", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo, a neighboring farm girl, as his [[Courtly love|lady love]], renaming her [[Dulcinea|Dulcinea del Toboso]], while she knows nothing of this. Expecting to become famous quickly, he arrives at an [[inn]], which he believes to be a [[castle]], calls the prostitutes he meets \"ladies\" (''doncellas''), and demands that the innkeeper, who he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. He spends the night holding [[vigil]] over his armor and becomes involved in a fight with [[Arriero|muleteers]] who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. In a pretended ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.\n\nDon Quixote next \"frees\" a young boy named Andres who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master, and makes his master swear to treat the boy fairly, but the boy's beating is continued (and in fact redoubled) as soon as Quixote leaves. Don Quixote then encounters traders from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], who \"insult\" the imaginary Dulcinea. He attacks them, only to be severely beaten and left on the side of the road, and is returned to his home by a neighboring peasant.\n\n====Destruction of Don Quixote's library (Chapters 6 and 7)====\nWhile Don Quixote is unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish [[curate]], and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of [[high comedy]]: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel ''[[La Galatea]]'' is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance ''Felixmarte de Hyrcania'' is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the [[The library of Don Quixote|library]], later telling Don Quixote that it was the action of a wizard (''encantador'').\n\n====The Second Sally====\nAfter a short period of feigning health, Don Quixote requests his neighbour, Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship (''\u00ednsula''). Sancho is a poor and simple farmer but more practical than the head-in-the-clouds Don Quixote and agrees to the offer, sneaking away with Don Quixote in the early dawn. It is here that their famous adventures begin, starting with Don Quixote's attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants.\n\nThe two next encounter two Benedictine friars travelling on the road ahead of a lady in a carriage. The friars are not travelling with the lady, but happen to be travelling on the same road.  Don Quixote takes the [[friar]]s to be enchanters who hold the lady captive, knocks a friar from his horse, and is challenged by an armed [[Basque people|Basque]] traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow from the carriage to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. Cervantes chooses this point, in the middle of the battle, to say that his source ends here. Soon, however, he resumes Don Quixote's adventures after a story about finding Arabic notebooks containing the rest of the story by Cid Hamet Ben Engeli. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to \"surrender\" to Don Quixote.\n\n[[File:Quijote1y2.jpg|thumb|First editions of the first and second part]]\n\n===== The Pastoral Peregrinations (Chapters 11\u201315) =====\nSancho and Don Quixote fall in with a group of goat herders. Don Quixote tells Sancho and the goat herders about the \"Golden Age\" of man, in which property does not exist and men live in peace. The goatherders invite the Knight and Sancho to the funeral of Gris\u00f3stomo, a former student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels (paralleling Don Quixote's decision to become a knight), seeking the shepherdess Marcela. At the funeral Marcela appears, vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by Gris\u00f3stomo, and claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich\u00e9s. She disappears into the woods, and Don Quixote and Sancho follow. Ultimately giving up, the two dismount by a pond to rest. Some [[Galician people|Galicians]] arrive to water their ponies, and Rocinante (Don Quixote's horse) attempts to mate with the ponies. The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him, whereupon Don Quixote tries to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho, leaving them in great pain.\n\n===== The inn (Chapters 16\u201317) =====\nAfter escaping the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride to a nearby inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls \"the balm of Fierabras\", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.\n\n===== The galley slaves and Cardenio (Chapters 19\u201324) =====\n[[File:Don Quijote and Sancho Panza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Don Quixote de la Mancha and Sancho Panza'', 1863, by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\nAfter Don Quixote has adventures involving a dead body, a helmet, and freeing a group of [[galley slave]]s, he and Sancho wander into the [[Sierra Morena]] and there encounter the dejected [[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]. Cardenio relates the first part of his [[The History of Cardenio#Synopsis of \"Cardenio\", the episode in the novel Don Quixote|story]], in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend Lucinda, and is hired as the companion to the Duke's son, leading to his friendship with the Duke's younger son, Don Fernando. Cardenio confides in Don Fernando his love for Lucinda and the delays in their engagement, caused by Cardenio's desire to keep with tradition. After reading Cardenio's poems praising Lucinda, Don Fernando falls in love with her. Don Quixote interrupts when Cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels. They get into a fight, ending with Cardenio beating all of them and walking away to the mountains.\n\n===== The priest, the barber, and Dorotea (Chapters 25\u201331) =====\nQuixote pines for Dulcinea, imitating Cardenio. Quixote sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village and brings them to Quixote. The priest and barber make plans with Sancho to trick Don Quixote to come home. They get the help of Dorotea, a woman whom they discover in the forest, that has been deceived by Don Fernando with promises of love and marriage. She pretends that she is the Princess Micomicona and desperate to get Quixote's help. Quixote runs into Andres, who insults his incompetence.\n\n===== Return to the inn (Chapters 32\u201342) =====\nConvinced that he is on a quest to return princess Miconiconia to the throne of her kingdom, Quixote and the group return to the previous inn where the priest tells the story of Anselmo ([[Lothario#The Man Who Was Recklessly Curious|The Impertinentely Curious Man]]) while Quixote, sleepwalking, battles with wineskins that he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomiconia's kingdom. A stranger arrives at the inn accompanying a young woman. The stranger is revealed to be Don Fernando, and the young woman Lucinda. Dorotea is reunited with Don Fernando and Cardenio with Lucinda. A captive from Moorish lands arrives and is asked to tell the story of his life. A judge arrives, and it is found that the captive is his long-lost brother, and the two are reunited.\n\n===== The ending (Chapters 45\u201352) =====\nAn officer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] has a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley slaves. The priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote's insanity. The officer agrees, and Quixote is locked in a cage and made to think that it is an enchantment and that there is a prophecy of his heroic return home. While traveling, the group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, and he is finally brought home. The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.\n\n===Part 2===\n[[File:Don Quixote Illustration I.jpg|thumb|Illustration to ''The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha''. Volume II.]]\n\nAlthough the two parts are now published as a single work, ''Don Quixote, Part Two'' was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. While ''Part One'' was mostly farcical, the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception.\n\n''Part Two'' of ''Don Quixote'' explores the concept of a character understanding that he is written about, an idea much explored in the 20th century. As ''Part Two'' begins, it is assumed that the literate classes of Spain have all read the first part of the story. Cervantes' [[meta-fiction]]al device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of ''Part One'', as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two.\n\n====The Third Sally====\nWhen strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of ''Part One'') that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.\n\nSancho later gets his comeuppance for this when, as part of one of the Duke and Duchess's pranks, the two are led to believe that the only method to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the Duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets a governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler although this ends in humiliation as well. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.\n\nThe lengthy untold \"history\" of Don Quixote's adventures in knight-errantry comes to a close after his battle with the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Don Quixote's hometown who had previously posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach in [[Barcelona]], in which the reader finds him conquered. Bound by the rules of chivalry, Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror: here, it is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (in which he may be cured of his madness). He and Sancho undergo one more prank by the Duke and Duchess before setting off.\n\nUpon returning to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Quixano (his proper name) only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.\n\n==Meaning==\n[[Harold Bloom]] says ''Don Quixote'' is the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war with Freud's reality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes The Knight in the Mirror] a 2003 book report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about [[Harold Bloom]]'s book.</ref>\n\n[[Edith Grossman]], who wrote and published a highly acclaimed English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:<blockquote>The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muOZ6WdAg3o Edith Grossman about Don Quixote as tragedy and comedy] a discussion held in New York City on 5 February 2009 by [[Words Without Borders]] (YouTube)</ref></blockquote>\n\nJonathan Shockley has placed the novel in the context of [[Terror Management Theory]], claiming that the figure of Don Quixote represents the hidden essence of human culture: the centrality of heroic madness and its related death anxiety in all people. The flimsy, delusional (and evil-causing) nature of the things that grant humans conviction and self-aggrandizement. And the ironic (and ultimately tragic) need to acquire this conviction and self-aggrandizement to experience the goodness, richness and reality of life.\n\n==Themes==\n{{See also|List of works influenced by Don Quixote}}\n[[File:Don Quichotte Honor\u00e9 Daumier.jpg|thumb|right|''Don Quixote'' by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] (1868)]]\n\nThe novel's structure is [[episode|episodic]] in form. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, as ''ingenioso'' (Spanish) means \"quick with inventiveness\",<ref>{{lang|es|ingenio <sup>'''1'''</sup>}}, ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola''</ref> marking the transition of modern literature from [[Classical unities|dramatic]] to thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.\n\nAlthough [[burlesque]] on the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.\n\nEven faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire of [[orthodoxy]], veracity and even nationalism. In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped move beyond the narrow literary conventions of the [[chivalric romance]] literature that he [[Parody|spoofed]], which consists of straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to the [[Chivalry|knightly virtues]] of the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word ''[[Quixotism|quixotic]]'' was quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed, [[Rocinante]], are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase \"[[tilting at windmills]]\" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.\n\nIt stands in a unique position between medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]] and the modern novel. The former consist of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through \"having read his adventures\", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more \"Alonso Quixano the Good\".\n\n==Background==\n\n===Sources===\nSources for ''Don Quixote'' include the Castilian novel ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, is ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', which the priest describes in Chapter VI of ''Quixote'' as \"the best book in the world.\" (However, the sense in which it was \"best\" is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called \"the most difficult passage of ''Don Quixote''\".)\nThe scene of the book burning gives us an excellent list of Cervantes' likes and dislikes about literature.\n\nCervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poem ''[[Orlando furioso]]''. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet of [[Mambrino]], an episode from Canto I of ''Orlando'', and itself a reference to [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s ''[[Orlando innamorato]]''.<ref>''Don Quijote de la Mancha'', Miguel de Cervantes, Edici\u00f3n de Florencio Sevilla Arroyo, \u00c1rea 2002 p. 161</ref> The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 of ''Orlando'', regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.<ref>\"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes, translated and annotated by Edith Grossman, p. 272</ref>\n\nAnother important source appears to have been Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale \"The Curious Impertinent\" in chapter 35 of the first part of ''Don Quixote'' is a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program.<ref>See chapter 2 of E. C. Graf's ''Cervantes and Modernity''.</ref> Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.\n\nCervantes' experiences as a [[galley slave]] in Algiers also influenced ''Quixote''.\n\n===Spurious ''Second Part'' by Avellaneda===\nIt is not certain when Cervantes began writing ''Part Two'' of ''Don Quixote'', but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. About September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitled ''Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate) [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]], of [[Tordesillas]]'', was published in [[Tarragona]] by an unidentified [[Aragon]]ese who was an admirer of [[Lope de Vega]], rival of Cervantes.<ref name=\"Ei\">{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Eisenberg|title=Cervantes, Lope and Avellaneda|work= Estudios cervantinos|location= Barcelona: Sirmio|year= 1991|pages= 119\u201341|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/hisp/56826142007993728511191/p0000002.htm#I_7_.}}</ref> It was translated into [[English language|English]] by William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.\n\nSome modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that ''Cervantes'' encountered it, which may have been much earlier.\n\nAvellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who not surprisingly took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes' ''Segunda Parte'' lend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly. \n\nIn his introduction to ''The Portable Cervantes'', [[Samuel Putnam]], a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version \"one of the most disgraceful performances in history\".<ref>Cervantes, Miguel, [https://archive.org/details/portablecervante0000cerv <!-- quote=putnam portable cervantes. --> ''The Portable Cervantes''], ed.

In Cervantes' ''Segunda Parte'', Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda's ''Second Part'' being printed there, in an early example of [[metafiction]].<ref>Lyons, M. (2011). Books: a living history.

By [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\n''Don Quixote, Part One'' contains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the [[picaresque]] figures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is \"El Curioso Impertinente\" (the impertinently curious man), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of a [[Florence|Florentine]] nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity, and talks his close friend [[Lothario]] into attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.\n\nIn ''Part Two'', the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions in ''Part One'' and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, \"Part Two\" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.\n\nSeveral abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.<ref>An example is ''The Portable Cervantes'' (New York: Viking Penguin, 1949), which contains an abridged version of the Samuel Putnam translation.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\n===Spelling and pronunciation===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2013}}\nCervantes wrote his work in early modern Spanish, heavily borrowing from [[Old Spanish language|Old Castilian]], the medieval form of the language. The language of ''Don Quixote'', although still containing [[archaisms]], is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of the ''[[Poema de mio Cid]]'', a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes' language as [[Middle English]] is from [[Modern English]]. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.\n\nIn ''Don Quixote'', there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource \u2013 he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times, when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.)\n\nIn Old Castilian, the letter ''x'' represented the sound written ''sh'' in modern English, so the name was originally pronounced {{IPA-es|ki\u02c8\u0283ote|}}. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, a [[sound change]] caused it to be pronounced with a [[voiceless velar fricative]] sound (like the [[Scots language|Scottish]] or German ''ch''), and today the Spanish pronunciation of \"Quixote\" is {{IPA-es|ki\u02c8xote|}}. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such as [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[French language|French]], where it is pronounced with a \"sh\" or \"ch\" sound; the French opera ''[[Don Quichotte]]'' is one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.\n\nToday, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation of ''Quixote'' (''Quijote''), as {{IPAc-en|k|i\u02d0|\u02c8|h|o\u028a|t|i|}},<ref name=\"oed\"/> although the traditional English [[spelling pronunciation|spelling-based pronunciation]] with the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|\u0259|t|}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|o\u028a|t|}}. In [[Australian English]], the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|w|\u026a|k|s|\u0259|t|}} until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to \"anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=P.

Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:\n\n{{quote|text=Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer.|sign=Miguel de Cervantes|source=''Don Quixote'', Volume II, Chapter 74}}\n\nIn 2004, a multidisciplinary team of academics from [[Complutense University]], led by Francisco Parra Luna, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Nieto, and Santiago Petschen Verdaguer, deduced that the village was that of [[Villanueva de los Infantes, Ciudad Real|Villanueva de los Infantes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article404423.ece|title=To Quixote's village at the speed of a nag|newspaper=Times Online | location=London}}</ref> Their findings were published in a paper titled ''\"'El Quijote' como un sistema de distancias/tiempos: hacia la localizaci\u00f3n del lugar de la Mancha\"'', which was later published as a book: ''El enigma resuelto del Quijote''.

Cervantes was friend of the family Villase\u00f1or, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acu\u00f1a. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road from [[El Toboso]] to [[Miguel Esteban]] in 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of \"hidalgo\", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2014/12/07/54830651268e3e242b8b4576.html|title=Don Quijote era Acu\u00f1a el Procurador|newspaper=El Mundo | location=Madrid}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2014/12/07/actualidad/1417983722_234613.html|title=Don Quijote de La Mancha: \u00bfrealidad o ficci\u00f3n?|newspaper=El Pa\u00eds | location=Madrid}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I suspect that in ''Don Quixote'', it does not rain a single time.

New Directions Publishing, 2013. ISBN 9780811218757. P. 15.</ref>}}\n\n===Language===\nBecause of its widespread influence, ''Don Quixote'' also helped cement the modern Spanish language. The opening sentence of the book created a classic Spanish clich\u00e9 with the phrase {{lang|es| \"de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme\" }} (\"whose name I do not wish to recall\"): {{lang|es| \"En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no hace mucho tiempo que viv\u00eda un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, roc\u00edn flaco y galgo corredor.\"}} (\"In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to recall, there lived, not very long ago, one of those gentlemen with a lance in the lance-rack, an ancient shield, a skinny old horse, and a fast greyhound.\")\n\nThe novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming in ''Don Quixote'' makes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the names ''[[Rocinante]]''<ref>{{lang|es|rocinante}}: deriv. of ''roc\u00edn'', work horse; colloq., brusque labourer; rough, unkempt man. ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.</ref> (a reversal) and ''[[Dulcinea]]'' (an allusion to illusion), and the word {{lang|es|quixote}} itself, possibly a pun on {{lang|es|quijada}} (jaw) but certainly {{lang|es|cuixot}} (Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse's [[rump (animal)|rump]].<ref>quijote<sup>'''1.2'''</sup>: rump or haunch. ''Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.''</ref>\n\nAs a military term, the word ''quijote'' refers to ''[[cuisses]]'', part of a full suit of [[plate armour]] protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix ''-ote'' denotes the augmentative\u2014for example, ''grande'' means large, but ''grandote'' means extra large. Following this example, ''Quixote'' would suggest 'The Great Quijano', a play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.\n\n''La Mancha'' is a region of Spain, but ''mancha'' (Spanish word) means spot, mark, stain. Translators such as [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] have declared La Mancha to be one of the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one would imagine as the home of a courageous knight.\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:Illustration to Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration to ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' by Miguel de Cervantes (the edition translated by Charles Jarvis)]]\n[[File:Don Quixote attacking a puppet theatre.jpg|thumb|upright|Don Quixote.

In 1607, an edition was printed in [[Brussels]]. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608. Popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller issued an Italian edition in 1610. Yet another Brussels edition was called for in 1611.<ref name=\"BrO\" /> Since then, numerous editions have been released and in total, the novel is believed to have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/21-best-sellers1.htm |access-date=28 May 2018 |title=The 21 Best-selling Books of All Time |last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |page=1 |year=2018 |work=[[HowStuffWorks]]}}</ref> The work has been produced in numerous editions and languages, the Cervantes Collection, at the [[State Library of New South Wales]] includes over 1,100 editions.

Eight and a half years after ''Part One'' had appeared came the first hint of a forthcoming ''Segunda Parte'' (Part Two). \"You shall see shortly,\" Cervantes says, \"the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\"<ref>See also the introduction to Cervantes, Miguel de (1984) ''Don Quixote'', Penguin p. 18, for a discussion of Cervantes' statement in response to Avellaneda's attempt to write a sequel.</ref> ''Don Quixote, Part Two'', published by the same press as its predecessor, appeared late in 1615, and quickly reprinted in Brussels and Valencia (1616) and Lisbon (1617).  Parts One and Two were published as one edition in Barcelona in 1617. Historically, Cervantes' work has been said to have \"smiled [[Spanish chivalry|Spain's chivalry]] away\", suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prestage|first=Edgar| title=Chivalry|year=1928|page=110}}</ref>\n\n===English editions in translation===\n[[File:Gustave Dor\u00e9 - Miguel de Cervantes - Don Quixote - Part 1 - Chapter 1 - Plate 1 \"A world of disorderly notions, picked out of his books, crowded into his imagination\".jpg|thumb|upright|Don Quixote goes mad from his reading of books of chivalry. Engraving by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\nThere are many translations of the book, and it has been adapted many times in shortened versions. Many derivative editions were also written at the time, as was the custom of envious or unscrupulous writers. Seven years after the ''Parte Primera'' appeared, ''Don Quixote'' had been translated into French, German, Italian, and English, with the first French translation of 'Part II' appearing in 1618, and the first English translation in 1620. One abridged adaptation, authored by Agust\u00edn S\u00e1nchez, runs slightly over 150 pages, cutting away about 750 pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://belgrado.cervantes.es/Biblioteca/Fichas/Cervantes.%20Saavedra,%20Miguel%20de%20(1547-1616)_114_58_1.shtml |title=Library catalogue of the Cervantes Institute of Belgrade |accessdate=2012-12-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814074311/http://belgrado.cervantes.es/Biblioteca/Fichas/Cervantes.%20Saavedra%2C%20Miguel%20de%20%281547-1616%29_114_58_1.shtml |archivedate=14 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]]'s English translation of the ''First Part'' appeared in 1612 while Cervantes was still alive, although there is no evidence that Shelton had met the author. Although Shelton's version is cherished by some, according to [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] and [[Samuel Putnam]], it was far from satisfactory as a carrying over of Cervantes' text.<ref name=\"Orm\" /> Shelton's translation of the novel's ''Second Part'' appeared in 1620.\n\nNear the end of the 17th century, [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]], a nephew of poet [[John Milton]], published what Putnam considered the worst English translation. The translation, as literary critics claim, was not based on Cervantes' text but mostly upon a French work by Filleau de Saint-Martin and upon notes which Thomas Shelton had written.\n\nAround 1700, a version by [[Pierre Antoine Motteux]] appeared. Motteux's translation enjoyed lasting popularity; it was reprinted as the [[Modern Library]] Series edition of the novel until recent times.<ref name=\"peabody\">Sieber, Harry.

George Peabody Library. 1996. Retrieved 26 December 2012.</ref> Nonetheless, future translators would find much to fault in Motteux's version: Samuel Putnam criticized \"the prevailing slapstick quality of this work, especially where [[Sancho Panza]] is involved, the obtrusion of the obscene where it is found in the original, and the slurring of difficulties through omissions or expanding upon the text\". John Ormsby considered Motteux's version \"worse than worthless\", and denounced its \"infusion of Cockney flippancy and facetiousness\" into the original.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://cervantes.tamu.edu/english/ctxt/DonQ-JohnOrmsby/DonQ-JohnOrmsby.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823072058/http://cervantes.tamu.edu/english/ctxt/DonQ-JohnOrmsby/DonQ-JohnOrmsby.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 August 2010 |title=Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, Translated by John Ormsby |chapter=Translator's Preface: About this translation }}</ref>\n\nThe proverb 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating' is widely attributed to Cervantes.

Through a printer's error, it came to be known, and is still known, as \"the Jarvis translation\". It was the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time, but future translator John Ormsby points out in his own introduction to the novel that the Jarvis translation has been criticized as being too stiff. Nevertheless, it became the most frequently reprinted translation of the novel until about 1885. Another 18th-century translation into English was that of [[Tobias Smollett]], himself a novelist, first published in 1755. Like the Jarvis translation, it continues to be reprinted today.\n\nA translation by Alexander James Duffield appeared in 1881 and another by Henry Edward Watts in 1888. Most modern translators take as their model the 1885 translation by John Ormsby.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAn expurgated children's version, under the title ''The Story of Don Quixote'', was published in 1922 (available on [[Project Gutenberg]]). It leaves out the risqu\u00e9 sections as well as chapters that young readers might consider dull, and embellishes a great deal on Cervantes' original text.
