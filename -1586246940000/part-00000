The film stars [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish jeweler and gambling addict in New York City's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond District|Diamond District]], who must retrieve an expensive gem he purchased to pay off his debts. The film also stars<!--Please keep the starring list the same as the one listed for the film's trailer--> [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]], and [[Eric Bogosian]]. Filming took place from September to November 2018. The [[Uncut Gems (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|original score]] was composed by [[Daniel Lopatin]].\n\n''Uncut Gems'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019. It entered into a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 13, 2019, before a [[wide release]] on December 25, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film received critical acclaim, with its screenplay, direction, editing, Sandler's performance and [[Darius Khondji]]'s cinematography receiving much of the praise. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2019]], with Sandler also winning the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]]. It became A24's highest-grossing film domestically with $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2010, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jewish]] miners retrieve a rare [[Opal|black opal]] from the Welo mine in Africa. In 2012, gambling addict Howard Ratner runs KMH, a jewelry store in New York's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond%20District|Diamond District]]. He struggles to pay off gambling debts, including the $100,000 he owes to Arno, his [[loan shark]] brother-in-law. His domestic life is split between Dinah, his estranged wife who has agreed to a divorce after [[Passover]], and his girlfriend Julia, an employee at KMH. Howard's business associate Demany recruits basketball superstar [[Kevin Garnett]] to visit KMH, and the Ethiopian opal, which Howard had ordered, coincidentally arrives while Garnett is in the store. He shows the opal to Garnett who becomes obsessed with it, insisting on holding onto it for good luck at his [[2012 NBA playoffs#(4)%20Boston%20Celtics%20vs%20(8)%20Philadelphia%2076ers|game that night]]. Howard reluctantly agrees, accepting Garnett's [[NBA Championship ring|NBA championship ring]] as collateral.   \n\nImmediately after Garnett leaves, Howard pawns the ring and places a [[Parlay (gambling)|6-way parlay]] on Garnett playing extraordinarily well in that night's game. Howard wins $600,000 but is ambushed at his daughter's school play by Arno and his bodyguards Phil and Nico. Arno reveals that he placed a stop on Howard's bet as it was made with money owed to him. Phil and Nico strip Howard naked and lock him in the trunk of his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], forcing him to call Dinah for help. Howard tracks down Demany who is at a nightclub party hosted by [[The Weeknd]]. Demany says that Garnett still has the opal, angering Howard. Furthermore, Howard discovers Julia and The Weeknd snorting [[cocaine]] together in a bathroom, causing a fistfight between Howard and The Weeknd. Howard demands that Julia move out of his apartment. After an awkward Passover dinner, Howard asks Dinah to give him another shot, which she immediately rejects.\n\nGarnett returns the opal before the auction and offers to purchase it for $175,000, but Howard refuses, given the substantially larger appraisal. Just before the auction starts, Howard discovers the opal has been appraised for significantly less than his initial estimate of $1,000,000. He convinces his father-in-law Gooey to bid on the gem to drive up the price, but the plan backfires when Garnett fails to top Gooey's final bid. A furious Gooey gives Howard the opal before Arno, Phil, and Nico confront Howard outside the auction house and assault him. Howard returns to KMH, bloody and in tears, before Julia arrives and comforts him, reconciling in the process.\n\nHoward learns that Garnett is still willing to purchase the opal; as soon as the sale is made, Howard immediately bets the proceeds on a 3-way parlay on Garnett having a strong Game 7 performance. He tells Julia to travel by helicopter to [[Mohegan Sun]] to place the bet for him. She narrowly escapes as Arno, Phil and Nico come to KMH to collect. The thugs find Howard in his office and threaten him, but he refuses to call Julia and cancel the bet. Furious, the three attempt to pursue her, but Howard locks them in the store's [[Mantrap (access control)|mantrap]]. Howard excitedly watches the game on TV while Arno, Phil and Nico resignedly watch from the mantrap. \n\nThe Celtics win the game, winning Howard $1.2 million. An ecstatic Howard frees Arno, Phil and Nico from the mantrap, but an enraged Phil shoots Howard in the face, killing him. Arno protests and tries to escape but Phil shoots and kills him too. Julia hurriedly leaves the casino with Howard's winnings while Phil and Nico loot KMH just as police sirens are heard. The camera then zooms into Howard\u2019s bullet wound, revealing the uncut gem within.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish-American [[Diamond District, Manhattan|Diamond District]] jeweler who is addicted to [[gambling]]\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Demany, Howard's assistant, who recruits clients\n* [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]] as Julia De Fiore, Howard's employee and girlfriend\n* [[Kevin Garnett]] as himself, a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for the [[Boston Celtics]]\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as Dinah Ratner, Howard's wife\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Arno, Howard's brother in law and a [[loan shark]]\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Gooey, Howard's father-in-law\n* Keith Williams Richards as Phil, Arno's quick-tempered henchman\n* Jonathan Aranbayev as Eddie Ratner, Howard's older son\n* Noa Fisher as Marcel Ratner, Howard's daughter\n* [[The Weeknd|Abel Tesfaye]] as himself, a then-rising [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] star better known as The Weeknd<!--\nAbove cast is credited in this order in the film's opening credits-->\n* [[Mike Francesa]] as Gary, Howard's bookie\n* Jacob Igielski as Beni Ratner, Howard's younger son\n* Wayne Diamond as Wayne, a wealthy gambler who takes a liking to Julia\n* [[Josh Ostrovsky]] as Noah\n* Benjy Kleiner as Aaron\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Lexis\n* Tommy Kominik as Nico\n*Louis Arias as Buddy\n* Keren Shemel as Elline Goldfarb\n* Sahar Bibiyan as Ida\n\nAdditionally, [[John Amos]], [[Ca$h Out]], Joe Iskhakov, and [[Trinidad James]] appear as themselves, with Amos appearing as Howard's neighbor and the others as acquaintances of Demany.

The film stars [[Adam Sandler]] as Howard Ratner, a Jewish jeweler and gambling addict in New York City's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond District|Diamond District]], who must retrieve an expensive gem he purchased to pay off his debts. The film also stars<!--Please keep the starring list the same as the one listed for the film's trailer--> [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Julia Fox (actress)|Julia Fox]], and [[Eric Bogosian]]. Filming took place from September to November 2018. The [[Uncut Gems (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|original score]] was composed by [[Daniel Lopatin]].\n\n''Uncut Gems'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019. It entered into a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 13, 2019, before a [[wide release]] on December 25, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film received critical acclaim, with its screenplay, direction, editing, Sandler's performance and [[Darius Khondji]]'s cinematography receiving much of the praise. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2019]], with Sandler also winning the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]]. It became A24's highest-grossing film domestically with $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2010, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jewish]] miners retrieve a rare [[Opal|black opal]] from the Welo mine in Africa. In 2012, gambling addict Howard Ratner runs KMH, a jewelry store in New York's [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond%20District|Diamond District]]. He struggles to pay off gambling debts, including the $100,000 he owes to Arno, his [[loan shark]] brother-in-law. His domestic life is split between Dinah, his estranged wife who has agreed to a divorce after [[Passover]], and his girlfriend Julia, an employee at KMH. Howard's business associate Demany recruits basketball superstar [[Kevin Garnett]] to visit KMH, and the Ethiopian opal, which Howard had ordered, coincidentally arrives while Garnett is in the store. He shows the opal to Garnett who becomes obsessed with it, insisting on holding onto it for good luck at his [[2012 NBA playoffs#(4)%20Boston%20Celtics%20vs%20(8)%20Philadelphia%2076ers|game that night]]. Howard reluctantly agrees, accepting Garnett's [[NBA Championship ring|NBA championship ring]] as collateral.   \n\nImmediately after Garnett leaves, Howard pawns the ring and places a [[Parlay (gambling)|6-way parlay]] on Garnett playing extraordinarily well in that night's game. Howard wins $600,000 but is ambushed at his daughter's school play by Arno and his bodyguards Phil and Nico. Arno reveals that he placed a stop on Howard's bet as it was made with money owed to him. Phil and Nico strip Howard naked and lock him in the trunk of his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], forcing him to call Dinah for help. Howard tracks down Demany who is at a nightclub party hosted by [[The Weeknd]]. Demany says that Garnett still has the opal, angering Howard. Furthermore, Howard discovers Julia and The Weeknd snorting [[cocaine]] together in a bathroom, causing a fistfight between Howard and The Weeknd. Howard demands that Julia move out of his apartment. After an awkward Passover dinner, Howard asks Dinah to give him another shot, which she immediately rejects.\n\nGarnett returns the opal before the auction and offers to purchase it for $175,000, but Howard refuses, given the substantially larger appraisal. Just before the auction starts, Howard discovers the opal has been appraised for significantly less than his initial estimate of $1,000,000. He convinces his father-in-law Gooey to bid on the gem to drive up the price, but the plan backfires when Garnett fails to top Gooey's final bid. A furious Gooey gives Howard the opal before Arno, Phil, and Nico confront Howard outside the auction house and assault him. Howard returns to KMH, bloody and in tears, before Julia arrives and comforts him, reconciling in the process.\n\nHoward learns that Garnett is still willing to purchase the opal; as soon as the sale is made, Howard immediately bets the proceeds on a 3-way parlay on Garnett having a strong Game 7 performance. He tells Julia to travel by helicopter to [[Mohegan Sun]] to place the bet for him. She narrowly escapes as Arno, Phil and Nico come to KMH to collect. The thugs find Howard in his office and threaten him, but he refuses to call Julia and cancel the bet. Furious, the three attempt to pursue her, but Howard locks them in the store's [[Mantrap (access control)|mantrap]]. Howard excitedly watches the game on TV while Arno, Phil and Nico resignedly watch from the mantrap. \n\nThe Celtics win the game, winning Howard $1.2 million. An ecstatic Howard frees Arno, Phil and Nico from the mantrap, but an enraged Phil shoots Howard in the face, killing him. Arno protests and tries to escape but Phil shoots and kills him too. Julia hurriedly leaves the casino with Howard's winnings while Phil and Nico loot KMH just as police sirens are heard.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The introduction of full-time staff has reduced response times from up to 15 minutes, to 105 seconds.  New sleeping quarters were constructed at the fire station to accommodate the full-time staff. The city purchased property for a second fire station in 2017, reflecting the increase in call volumes coming from its newer neighbourhoods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/second-fire-station-coming-to-fort|title=Second fire station coming to Fort|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nFort Saskatchewan was also home to Canada's longest serving firefighter: Walter Thomas (1922-2017).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/walter-thomas-passed-away-at-95|title=Firefighting \"legend\" Walter Thomas passes away at 95|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Walter joined the department on May 1, 1947, and served until May 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/fort-firefighter-retiring-after-storied-70-years-of-service|title=Fort firefighter retiring after storied 70 years of service|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> a few months before he passed away.

Garbage is collected bi-weekly, organics are collected weekly or bi-weekly depending on the time of year, and recycling is collected weekly. All three waste streams are collected by a contracted company. Blue bins were used for recycling in the pilot program, but the city reverted to blue bags when launching the new waste system city-wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/spring-changes-coming-for-waste-collection-in-fort|title=Spring changes coming for the Fort's waste collection|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> This was because objects often got jammed in blue bins, and crews could not easily tell if the loads inside blue bins were contaminated like they could with blue bags. Prior to this system, the municipality contracted out collection of garbage and recycling only; recycling was collected in blue bags, but garbage cans were not regulated by the city. \n \n== Government ==\nFort Saskatchewan is directly governed by a city council consisting of one mayor and six councillors. Municipal elections occur every four years on the third Monday in October. The last election was held on [[2017 Alberta municipal elections|October 16, 2017]] where [[Gale Katchur]] was re-elected for a third term as mayor. The mayor is elected separately from the councillors, who are elected at-large (as opposed to the ward system).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsask.ca/en/your-city-hall/city-council.aspx|title=City Council|date=2020-01-20|website=www.fortsask.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nOn the provincial level of government, Fort Saskatchewan is part of the riding called [[Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville]].

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]].

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The Italian chronicler Gabriele de\u2019 Mussi, in his ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348'', describes quite plausibly how the plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial.

This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as [[Host (biology)|hosts]], keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance.

F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> In 1984, zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nIt is recognised that an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] of the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] from figures for the clergy.\n\nIn addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere or [[Replication crisis|were not replicable at all]], despite extensive samples from other mass graves.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague\u2014which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nMcCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the \"laborious\" processes needed to discover rat remains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Michael|date=1 July 2003|title=Rats, Communications, and Plague: Toward an Ecological History|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=34|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1162/002219503322645439|issn=0022-1953|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3208221|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref> Wall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n</ref> Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-[[commensalism|commensal]]) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Monica|author-link=Monica Green (historian)|date=2014|title=Taking \"Pandemic\" Seriously: Making the Black Death Global|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|journal=The Medieval Globe|pages=31ff|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408203736/http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|archive-date=8 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]\nA variety of alternatives to ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward.

Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that they characterise as ''[[Bleeding|hemorrhagic]]'' plague similar to [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]]. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of numerous rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person.<ref>{{Cite news |author=M.

In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.<ref name=\"Byrne2004pp21-9\">{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=21\u201329}}</ref> In 2014, [[Public Health England]] announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\nThe historian George Hussman claimed that the plague had not occurred in East Africa until the 1900s.

Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on [[spirituality]] and the [[afterlife]].<ref>[[Barbara Tuchman]] (1978) ''A Distant Mirror'', Knopf {{ISBN|0-394-40026-7}}.</ref> It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the [[Patron#Arts|sponsorship]] of religious works of art.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html The End of Europe's Middle Ages: The Black Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309162102/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html |date=March 9, 2013 }} University of Calgary website. (Retrieved on April 5, 2007)</ref> However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors,<ref name=\"brotton\">Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.</ref> in combination with an [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance#Contribution of Greek scholars to the Italian Renaissance|influx of Greek scholars]] following the [[Fall of Constantinople#Impact on the Renaissance|fall of the Byzantine Empire]]{{Citation needed|2020|date=March 2020}}.\n[[File:The Triumph of Death P001393.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed plague, which devastated medieval Europe.]]\nThe plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of [[England in the Late Middle Ages|England]], then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.<ref>Netzley, Patricia D. ''Life During the Renaissance.''San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc., 1998.</ref>\n\nThe demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.<ref>Hause, S. & Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, p. 217). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.</ref> Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives, and this probably destabilized [[feudalism]].\n\nThe spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. [[Epidemic]]s ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and congenital syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.<ref>\"Renaissance And Reformation France\" Mack P. Holt pp. 30, 39, 69, 166</ref>\n\nItalian chronicler [[Agnolo di Tura]] recorded his experience from [[Siena]]:\n{{quote|Father abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through the breath and sight. And so they died. And none could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices ... great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds both day and night ... And as soon as those ditches were filled more were dug ... And I, Agnolo di Tura ... buried my five children with my own hands. And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city. There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death.

Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hatty|first1=Suzanne E.|last2=Hatty|first2=James|title=Disordered Body: Epidemic Disease and Cultural Transformation|publisher=SUNY Press|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0yJQXmGODgC&pg=PA89|year=1999|isbn=9780791443651}}</ref>\n\n==Recurrences==\n\n=== Second plague pandemic ===\n{{Main|Second plague pandemic}}\n[[File:Great plague of london-1665.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Great Plague of London]], in 1665, killed up to 100,000 people.]]\n\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2EBkPNnUXEC&pg=PA25 The Great Plague]'' {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401124035/https://books.google.com/books?id=x2EBkPNnUXEC&pg=PA25 |date=1 April 2019 }}.

The Italian chronicler Gabriele de\u2019 Mussi, in his ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348'', describes quite plausibly how the plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial.

This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as [[Host (biology)|hosts]], keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance.

The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors,<ref name=\"brotton\">Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.</ref> in combination with an [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance#Contribution of Greek scholars to the Italian Renaissance|influx of Greek scholars]] following the [[Fall of Constantinople#Impact on the Renaissance|fall of the Byzantine Empire]]{{Citation needed|2020|date=March 2020}}.\n[[File:The Triumph of Death P001393.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed plague, which devastated medieval Europe.]]\nThe plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of [[England in the Late Middle Ages|England]], then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.<ref>Netzley, Patricia D. ''Life During the Renaissance.''San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc., 1998.</ref>\n\nThe demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.<ref>Hause, S. & Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, p. 217). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.</ref> Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives, and this probably destabilized [[feudalism]].\n\nThe spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. [[Epidemic]]s ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and congenital syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.<ref>\"Renaissance And Reformation France\" Mack P. Holt pp. 30, 39, 69, 166</ref>\n\nItalian chronicler [[Agnolo di Tura]] recorded his experience from [[Siena]]:\n{{quote|Father abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through the breath and sight. And so they died. And none could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices ... great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds both day and night ... And as soon as those ditches were filled more were dug ... And I, Agnolo di Tura ... buried my five children with my own hands. And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city. There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death.

Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period.

The main feature of Belgrave is Marlborough way which cuts the area in half. Belgrave contains Tamworth fire station, a [[Morrisons supermarket]], a high school, three primary schools and is bordered by [[Two Gates]], [[Wilnecote]] and [[Glascote]].\n\n==History==\nStarting life as a [[coal mine|mining]] village, on previously agricultural land, Belgrave had its own colliery up until the late 19th century. Other former local industries were [[terracotta]] works and [[car industry|motor manufacturing]]. The area was considerably expanded in the 1970s with the addition of two new housing estates for the 'over-spill' population of [[Birmingham]].<ref>[https://historyofbelgrave.weebly.com/history.html History of Belgrave website]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nBelgrave contains [[Tamworth Enterprise College]] which is a state [[High School]].\n\nBelgrave also contains St Gabriels R C Primary School which is the state [[Roman Catholic]] primary school for [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]].\n\n==Public Services==\nTamworth Community Fire station is located in Belgrave. Completed in 2010, the station is state-of-the-art including several large meeting rooms, and a gym for use by partners of the station.

One among them was the patriarch of the wealthy Croom family, who in 1826 purchased land around the town of [[Tallahassee]].

To this plant Nuttall \"doubtfully attaches the name\" ''Taxus montana'', somewhat of a [[nomen nudum]], because Nuttall never actually described the plant besides quoting a summary description from Torrey's letter to him.

Henkel and Hochstetter synonymised this taxon with ''T. taxifolia'' in their work mentioned above.<ref name=Henkel1865/> According to the [[Index Kewensis]] this was in error; the name ''Taxus montana'' had actually already been given to a species, now ''[[Prumnopitys montana]]'', described (validated, in fact) in 1806 by [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]] from specimens collected by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]] on their famous scientific exploration of the Americas, and Nuttall had in fact referred to Willdenow's species.<ref name=INPI4/> [[John Nelson (horticulturist)|John Nelson]], in his more utilitarian as opposed to scientific 1866 horticultural handbook of firs and pines for growing in Britain, introduced the name ''Foetataxus montana'' to write about ''Torreya taxifolia'', apparently unaware of the German publication the previous year.<ref name=Nelson1866/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ipni.org/n/262075-1 |title=''Foetataxus montana'' |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2020 |website=International Plant Names Index |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> In fact, all these sources were wrong, for Nuttall states that he found a newer specimen of Croom's, of the same taxon, in the Herbarium of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] labelled as ''Taxus floridana''!<ref name=Nuttall1849/> Despite that the original synonymy with ''T. floridana'', all these names are still maintained in the synonymy of ''Torreya taxifolia'' in some modern databases as of 2020.<ref name=PoWO/>\n\nThe [[University of North Carolina]] Herbarium has a single specimen, originally from the Jesup Herbarium of [[Dartmouth College]], sent hither by Croom from the \"Apalache River\" in 1833.

He also mentions the seed, covered in the aril, are approximately the size of a [[nutmeg]].<ref name=Nuttall1849/> In 1865 the German botanists Henkel and Hochstetter note that the Americans called the tree \"stinking cedar\" and \"wild nutmeg\". They mention that the name \"nutmeg\" is derived from the bone-hard shelled and acorn-sized seeds, which are covered in an aril somewhat similar to that of true nutmeg. They also describe that when the leaves are crushed they exude a pungent and disagreeable odour, which is why the local Americans used the name \"stinking cedar\". They themselves call the plant \"''Torrey's Nuss-Eibe''\", which translates as \"Torrey's nut-yew\" in English.<ref name=Henkel1865/> According to the gardening writer Nelson in 1866, ''Torreya'' species in general were known as \"stinking cedars\" or \"stinking nutmegs\" by the locals, though he himself recommended the name \"strong-odoured yew\" as preferred for British use. This specific species was called \"stinking cedar\" by the Americans according to him, although he recommended the name \"mountain yew\" for Britain -this is a calque of the (incorrect) Latin name he was using, he was apparently unaware of the fact that this species grows almost at sea level and nowhere near any mountains!<ref name=Nelson1866/> In fact, of all species of ''Torreya'', it is only the species which is never found in mountainous areas.\n\n[[Image:T taxifolia.jpg|thumb|Seed cone]]\n\nAlthough the [[vernacular name]] '''Florida torreya''' was formally recommended by most conservation works and internet databases,<ref name=FlorPlAtl/><ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=FNA/><ref name=Coile1998/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> this was changed to '''Florida nutmeg''' in the late 2010s.<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=PLANTS/> Other names for this tree are '''savin''',<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> '''polecat wood''',<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> '''yew-leaved torreya''',<ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=Nuttall1849/> '''foetid yew''',<ref name=Alfieri1987/> '''stinking cedar''',<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=USBG>{{cite web |url=https://m.usbg.gov/plants/stinking-cedar |title=Stinking cedar |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=United States Botanic Garden |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> '''mountain yew''' (Britain)<ref name=Nelson1866/> or '''stinking yew'''{{cn|date=March 2020}} (applied to the Californian species ''[[Torreya californica]]'').<ref name=Nelson1866/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:The North American sylva (Pl.

She made this suggestion based on the fact that this species is rare, that it grew well in the cooler temperatures of [[North Carolina]], and her belief that the species was only found on the east bank of the Apalachicola and was unable to disperse to the west bank with the animals she thought might be the main dispersal agents today, squirrels. She theorised than during the [[Eemian|last interglacial]] (the geologically short periods between [[ice age]]s) and the proceeding ones, the species grew further north. According to her theories, because there might have been an unknown and now extinct animal in the past which was better suited to eat and defecate the seeds, or otherwise move the seeds, the species was now \"stuck\" behind the Apalachicola which served as a refuge habitat for a [[Relict (biology)|relict population]] during the long periods of glacial conditions which characterised the [[Pleistocene]]. She further supposed that because the arils contain [[terpene]]s which are usually toxic for mammals, and the seed's shell is so thin that mammal molars would crush the seeds, that the purported extinct animal might not be a mammal and instead suggested some unknown species of large [[tortoise]] as the extinct ecological partner.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n==Uses==\nIt is has been far too rare to harvest commercially since the 1950s, but it has a beautiful, yellow-coloured, close-grained wood.

In this era it was also recommended as making excellent posts for fencing, not being liable to attack by insects.<ref name=Nuttall1849/>\n\nWhen the trunks are damaged, the trees yield a small quantity of pasty, viscous, blood-red [[turpentine]], which can be dissolved in alcohol, but has a very powerful and unpleasant odour.<ref name=Nuttall1849/> \n\n===Cultivation===\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted outside of its native range as an ornamental, and is found in private gardens, [[arboretum|arboreta]] and botanical gardens.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/>\n\nIt was first imported to grow in Europe in 1840.

In a 1967 article S. A. Alfieri Jr. ''et al''. of the [[Florida Department of Agriculture]] presented their research of the phenomenon. The disease presents itself as a small, yellowish spot on the needles (leaves) -one or more per leaf, which soon spreads throughout the leaf until it dies, turns brown and falls off. Subsequently the disease spreads into the twig, and all of the needles fall off, leaving only a tuft of new growth at the tip. The disease spreads in stages, first affecting portions, later the entire tree. Severely infected trees eventually loose most of their needles and twigs. Fungal fruiting structures grow on wholly necrotic tissue on the underside of the leaves, twigs and buds. In some cases, the stems of affected or dead trees also showed fungal [[canker]]. Young seedlings are also affected, but less severely than older trees. Trees growing in the shade are more affected than those in full sunlight.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> \n\nIn 1985 the [[phytopathologist]] Nabih Elias El-Gholl, also of the Florida Department of Agriculture, was able to prove that there were at least two pathogens involved; the leaf-spot disease presented as light greyish-green spots, which later became tan-coloured, and were up to 8.4mm long and as wide as the needle, with brown, irregularly-shaped, 2.4mm long \u00d7 2mm wide, necrotic centres and were able to infect the plants in the absence of wounds within three days of inoculation. Initially only a few spots, maximally four, developed per plant. After some two weeks the infected needles died and fell off -by this time the undersides had developed spore structures,<ref name=El-Gholl1985>{{cite journal |last=El-Gholl |first=Nabih Elias |date=1985 |title=''Fusarium lateritium'' Causing Needle Spots on ''Torreya taxifolia'' in Florida |url=https://www.apsnet.org/publications/PlantDisease/BackIssues/Documents/1985Abstracts/PD_69_905a.htm |journal=Plant Disease |volume=69 |pages=905 |doi=10.1094/PD-69-905a |access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> which were primarily found along the two grey bands of stomata, but may also occur on the twigs.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nThe canker disease presents as elongated [[fusiform]] swellings on the stems which eventually may break open. They are often found at the base of the trees.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nIn 1993 Schwartz, who has spent much of his career researching the conservation of this species, and Sharon M. Hermann, reported on the progression of the disease. They monitored a census population of some 100 trees for four years, in this time 10% died, mostly the smaller individuals. Most plants consisted of multi-stemmed, regenerating stumps; the mean length of the longest stems were less than one meter. Less than half of the plants showed any growth in length during these four years, and 32% lost their primary stem, which meant the mean size of individuals within the population was decreasing. Death was not strongly related to specific location or if the plants showed disease symptoms, although stem mortality was higher with trees showing a higher severity of foliar pathogens.<ref name=Schwartz1993/> In 2000 Schwartz ''et al''. reported that despite Godfrey and Kurz's 1962 prediction, a small population size, continued population losses, and no known seed production for decades, extinction of ''T. taxifolia'' had not yet occurred, and although the population would likely steadily decline, it was unlikely to go extinct within the next 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Status===\nThis was one of the first federally listed {{C|Endangered flora of the United States|endangered plant species in the United States}} in 1984 (Federal Register 1/23/84).<ref name=FNA/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=USFWS1984/> It is one of only two species of conifer protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref name=Earle2020/> It was listed as \"[[threatened species|threatened]]\" within the state of Florida by 1987 (Florida Statutes Section 581.185),<ref name=Alfieri1987/> again in 1994 by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,<ref name=Esser1993/> and in 1998 the status in Florida was changed to \"[[endangered]]\".<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Coile1998/> In 2002 it was added to the list of \"endangered\" plants of Georgia.<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> It has been a \"[[critically endangered]]\" species on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1998, in 2000 this was said to be due to estimated 98% decline in mature individuals since the early 1950s.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=iucn2000/>\n\n===Population===\nIn 2000 Schwartz and colleagues calculated that before the start of the decline, the original population of ''T. taxifolia'' may have been 300,000 between 650,000 plants, with 357,500 individual trees being the preferred estimate, based on a historic abundance of 14.2% of dominant ravine trees in 1914, or 30 trees/ha, and a historic distribution of some {{convert|203|km2|acres}}.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> Only 27 trees were counted in Georgia in 1981.<ref name=iucn2000/> In 1993 Schwartz estimated that there were only 1500 trees in the wild.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Schwartz1993/> Based on the extrapolation of a survey of five stands of the 2000 survey, attenuated with assumptions that these stands were the most dense, Schwartz ''et al''. calculated the population in its native habitat to be between 500 and 4,000 individuals, with none capable of reproduction. The most likely population was calculated to be 1,361 individuals, not including the population west of the Apalachicola. Using their estimate of the pre-decline population, they thus calculated a minimum 98.5% decline in population over the last 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> The [[IUCN]] estimated that the population is 999 mature individuals in its native habitat (although, confusingly, it also states the population to consist of between 500 and 600 trees elsewhere in the assessment), of which less than ten were known to produce male or female cones.<ref name=iucn2010/> It stated that the population continued to decrease,<ref name=iucn2010/> although the decline may be reversible should the causes of infection be better understood.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> IUCN population viability analyses indicate that [[extinction]] within its native range is inevitable.<ref name=iucn2010/>\n\nThe IUCN stated the total [[extent of occurrence]] is estimated to be about {{convert|200|km2|acres}},<ref name=iucn2010/> this is the same as the historical distribution. Schwartz states that these has been no logging in its habitat since the 1950s and that this species has experienced no [[habitat loss]]: the vast majority of the original ravine forest habitat remains.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Threats===\nThe most significant current threat to the species is the continued reproductive failure associated with [[fungal]] pathogens.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Smith2010/> Individuals do not reach reproductive size before being top-killed.<ref name=iucn2010/> Almost no plants are able to reach a reproductive size, and where seeds do form, these are soft, crumbly and not viable.<ref name=Esser1993/> Up to ten species of fungi have been found growing in infected ''Torreya taxifolia''.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date= |title=''Fusarium torreyae'' sp nov., a pathogen causing canker disease of Florida torreya (''Torreya taxifolia''), a critically endangered conifer restricted to northern Florida and southwestern Georgia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232705140 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nAlfieri ''et al''. were able to [[Isolate (biology)|isolate]] five species of fungi in 1967 from the stems and leaves, but failed to isolate any of the fungi from the cankered stems on the media they were using, [[potato dextrose agar]]. They reported that the disease appeared to implicate species tentatively identified as ''[[Physalospora]]'' and ''[[Macrophoma]]'', but also isolated the fungi ''[[Rhizoctonia solani]]'', ''[[Sclerotium rolfsii]]'' and a ''[[Sphaeropsis]]'' species from the infected tissue.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> They attempted to reproduce the infections by spraying the isolates, as well as pulverised [[Plant litter|stem and leaf litter]], on seedlings grown in greenhouses from unaffected ornamental trees in local parks, but their experiments failed to induce the disease in their seedlings.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> Nonetheless reports from 1975 and 1988 continued to identify the responsible fungi as these previous two species.<ref name=Esser1993/> In 1985 El-Gholl was finally able to prove [[Koch's postulates]] with ''[[Gibberella baccata]]'' (as ''[[Fusarium lateritium]]'', an [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]] isolate) as the agent responsible for the leaf spot pathogen, but he was unable to replicate the disease causing the stem cankers.<ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=El-Gholl1985/><ref name=MycoBank>{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/Biolomics.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Rec=34922&Fields=All |title=''Gibberella baccata'' |last=Bensch |first=K. |date=2020 |website=MycoBank |publisher=International Mycological Association (IMA) and the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> In 1987 Alfieri ''et al''. reported on experiments with this fungus, as well as another two more species isolated from the infected plants, ''[[Xylocoremium flabelliforme]]'' (the anamorph state of ''[[Xylaria cubensis]]'') and the ''Macrophoma'' which they had re-identified as a ''[[Phyllosticta]]'' species, the anamorph form of ''[[Guignardia]]''. They were able to reproduce El-Gholl's results, but again failed to identify the canker producing agent, the other two isolates proved not to cause any disease.<ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> In a 1996 article Lee ''et al''. mentioned that the [[endophyte]] they were studying, ''[[Pestalotiopsis microspora]]'' might be the cause of the decline of the species, because a strain they isolated produced a hitherto unknown [[cytotoxin]] they named \"[[torreyanic acid]]\", a [[Merosity|dimeric]] [[quinone]].<ref name=Lee1996>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Julie Chu-Li |last2=Strobel |first2=Gary A. |last3=Lobkovsky |first3=Emil |last4=Clardy |first4=Jon |date=17 May 1996 |title=Torreyanic Acid: A Selectively Cytotoxic Quinone Dimer from the Endophytic Fungus ''Pestalotiopsis microspora'' |journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=61 |issue=10 |pages=3232\u20133233 |doi=10.1021/jo960471x}}</ref> ''P. microspora'' is a usually [[Commensalism|commensal]] fungus commonly found within the tissues of many plant species, and is only rarely a pathogen -in these cases it is an [[Opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogen]].<ref name=Smith2010/> However, recent research has identified a previously unknown species of ''[[Fusarium]]'' may be the cause.<ref name=iucn2010/> \n\nBy 1987 the canker disease had spread to plants cultivated outside the native range such as in the [[University of Florida]] campus in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] and in the [[Alfred B. Maclay Gardens State Park]] in Tallahassee.<ref name=Alfieri1987/> \n\nAccording to one older theory logging of shade trees may stress individuals of this species, which does not like being suddenly exposed to full sunlight, conducing infection.<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/>\n\nAnother threat to the population is destruction by [[White-tailed deer|deer]].<ref name=iucn2010/> Deer preferentially select young trees of this species to rub their new antlers on, sometimes killing them. Feral pigs may also uproot and destroy seedlings.<ref name=Esser1993/> Another possible cause of the historical decline may be changes in the environment due to fire suppression, and changes in water tables linked to the construction of dams.<ref name=iucn2010/> Specifically, many trees were killed when the land was flooded<ref name=Esser1993/> in the construction of the [[Jim Woodruff Dam]] impounding [[Lake Seminole]].<ref name=USBG/>\n\nAccording to one writer, the population of the species may have been impacted by postglacial [[global warming]], as it may possibly be better adapted to the cooler climate found in Florida during the last [[ice age]]. It may not have been able to move north due to poor dispersal abilities. This is based on the fact that the introduced population on the Biltmore estate in North Carolina appears to be doing fine, and is even reproducing naturally -squirrels plant the seeds in the flower beds and these germinate.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n===Actions===\n[[Fungicide]] treatment with [[Maneb]] has been shown to be remarkably effective, with plants showing renewed growth afterwards with little to no fungal infection. It has been applied since 1967,<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/> but as of 1987 it is not specifically labelled for use in ''Torreya''.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nA theory perhaps first put forward in 1990 by Greg Seamon, land manager at the [[Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve]], was that ''Torreya taxifolia'' may be somehow suffering from the suppression of fire in the upland longleaf pine-wiregrass sandhill ecosystems. However, after regular fires were again instituted in the 1990s in the preserve, this appeared not to have an effect, with the species experiencing an increased three percent annual mortality at the turn of the century.<ref name=Vaughan2001/>\n\nTwo years after declaring the species an endangered species, in 1986, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] published a recovery plan. The chief tactic was to produce a genetically diverse collection of trees for reproduction and reintroduction into the wild. Other priorities were to protect the habitat of remaining populations, and to study the disease and methods of [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/>\n\nPlants in general attract very little funding compared to [[vertebrate]]s, this tree is no different. The US federal government spent only $1,500 on conservation of the species in 1993, placing it 884th out of 926 endangered species. Schwartz ''et al''. stated that recovery is possible, but this will require a greater level of commitment and a dedicated increase in funding.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nSmall experiments by Schwartz and Hermann in the 1990s found that planting cuttings in the native habitat is possible. Schwartz ''et al''. recommended population augmentation by planting volunteers isolated by more than 100m from extant stands to reduce chance of contamination.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted for conservation purposes outside of its native range.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> Plants outside of its historic native distribution are undamaged by fungal disease and produce viable seed.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> In Tallahassee for example, not far from the native range, a number of large trees had been grown for almost a century in the Alfred B.

Plantation owners and their stocks of Negro slaves had began to move south to colonise and exploit the new land. One among them was the patriarch of the wealthy Croom family, who in 1826 purchased land around the town of [[Tallahassee]].

According to her theories, because there might have been an unknown and now extinct animal in the past which was better suited to eat and defecate the seeds, or otherwise move the seeds, the species was now \"stuck\" behind the Apalachicola which served as a refuge habitat for a [[Relict (biology)|relict population]] during the long periods of glacial conditions which characterised the [[Pleistocene]]. She further supposed that because the arils contain [[terpene]]s which are usually toxic for mammals, and the seed's shell is so thin that mammal molars would crush the seeds, that the purported extinct animal might not be a mammal and instead suggested some unknown species of large [[tortoise]] as the extinct ecological partner.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n==Uses==\nIt is has been far too rare to harvest commercially since the 1950s, but it has a beautiful, yellow-coloured, close-grained wood. The timber is lightweight, hard, strong and highly durable.<ref name=Esser1993/> In the 19th century, the tree was harvested for wood that was used as fence posts,<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> shingles,<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> cabinets,<ref name=Esser1993/> [[Christmas tree]]s,<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Esser1993/> firewood,<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> and as a fuel for riverboats on the [[Apalachicola River]].<ref name=iucn2010/> Fences made of this wood in the 1910s were still good in the 1970s.<ref name=Esser1993/> In the 1830s it was locally abundant enough for the trees to be harvested to be sawn into planks, which were much used in the construction of the village of [[Aspalaga Landing]]. In this era it was also recommended as making excellent posts for fencing, not being liable to attack by insects.<ref name=Nuttall1849/>\n\nWhen the trunks are damaged, the trees yield a small quantity of pasty, viscous, blood-red [[turpentine]], which can be dissolved in alcohol, but has a very powerful and unpleasant odour.<ref name=Nuttall1849/> \n\n===Cultivation===\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted outside of its native range as an ornamental, and is found in private gardens, [[arboretum|arboreta]] and botanical gardens.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/>\n\nIt was first imported to grow in Europe in 1840. Large trees were to be found in [[Germany]] by the 1860s.<ref name=Henkel1865/> It is tolerably hardy, but grows very slowly in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and as such was only recommended for collectors.<ref name=Nelson1866/>\n\nIt has occasionally been planted as a landscape tree around [[Tallahassee]], and one such specimen in [[Lee, Florida]] has achieved {{convert|30|ft}}.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> Some large specimens are grown elsewhere in botanical gardens. The [[champion tree]] of the species is in a private garden in [[Norlina, North Carolina]], having a height of {{convert|45|ft}}, a trunk diameter of {{convert|88|cm}} [[Diameter at breast height|dbh]] and a canopy width of {{convert|40|ft}} in 1996.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> It has been said to endure winter temperatures of {{convert|-31|C}} in North Carolina without much problem.<ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n===Propagation===\nCuttings of ''Torreya'' shoot-tips often show fungal contamination. Experimental studies with weekly sprayed applications of a combinations of [[Systemic pesticide|systemic]] [[fungicide]]s, such as [[thiophanate-methyl]] combined with [[zinc]] and [[Maneb]] or [[thiabendazole]], were able to eliminate the fungi from stock plants after four weeks, although these preparations were not US government approved as of 1987.<ref name=Alfieri1987/> \n\nTissue culture methods of propagation were being investigated as of 1987.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe first person to notice that the trees were dying was the forester L. T. Nieland in 1938, although he never wrote a formal paper about it. In the same year Kurz made a detailed study of the ecology of species and mentioned that there was no danger to the species vanishing from its habitat if lumbering would cease.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> In 1954 Kurz and R. K. Godfrey surveyed the population and noticed no symptoms of decline. However, in 1962 Godfrey and Kurz, having surveyed the species again, reported that the natural stands of this species, which was historically never widely distributed, were dying off and extinction seemed assured, if not already accomplished.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=GodfreyKurz1962>{{cite journal |last=Godfrey |first=R. K. |last2=Kurz |first2=H. |date=1962 |title=The Florida Torreya destined for extinction |url= |journal=Science |volume=136 |pages=900-902 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> By 1962, only non-reproductive sprouts regrowing from the top-killed stumps remained in the wild,<ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=GodfreyKurz1962/> a situation which has persisted throughout the 20th century.<ref name=FNA/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> They attributed this to deforestation due to the lumber trade.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=GodfreyKurz1962/> However, samples of the afflicted trees were sent to the [[University of Florida]], where Erdman West suggested the decline appeared due to a fungal blight of some kind. In a 1967 article S. A. Alfieri Jr. ''et al''. of the [[Florida Department of Agriculture]] presented their research of the phenomenon. The disease presents itself as a small, yellowish spot on the needles (leaves) -one or more per leaf, which soon spreads throughout the leaf until it dies, turns brown and falls off. Subsequently the disease spreads into the twig, and all of the needles fall off, leaving only a tuft of new growth at the tip. The disease spreads in stages, first affecting portions, later the entire tree. Severely infected trees eventually loose most of their needles and twigs. Fungal fruiting structures grow on wholly necrotic tissue on the underside of the leaves, twigs and buds. In some cases, the stems of affected or dead trees also showed fungal [[canker]]. Young seedlings are also affected, but less severely than older trees. Trees growing in the shade are more affected than those in full sunlight.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> \n\nIn 1985 the [[phytopathologist]] Nabih Elias El-Gholl, also of the Florida Department of Agriculture, was able to prove that there were at least two pathogens involved; the leaf-spot disease presented as light greyish-green spots, which later became tan-coloured, and were up to 8.4mm long and as wide as the needle, with brown, irregularly-shaped, 2.4mm long \u00d7 2mm wide, necrotic centres and were able to infect the plants in the absence of wounds within three days of inoculation. Initially only a few spots, maximally four, developed per plant. After some two weeks the infected needles died and fell off -by this time the undersides had developed spore structures,<ref name=El-Gholl1985>{{cite journal |last=El-Gholl |first=Nabih Elias |date=1985 |title=''Fusarium lateritium'' Causing Needle Spots on ''Torreya taxifolia'' in Florida |url=https://www.apsnet.org/publications/PlantDisease/BackIssues/Documents/1985Abstracts/PD_69_905a.htm |journal=Plant Disease |volume=69 |pages=905 |doi=10.1094/PD-69-905a |access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> which were primarily found along the two grey bands of stomata, but may also occur on the twigs.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nThe canker disease presents as elongated [[fusiform]] swellings on the stems which eventually may break open. They are often found at the base of the trees.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nIn 1993 Schwartz, who has spent much of his career researching the conservation of this species, and Sharon M. Hermann, reported on the progression of the disease. They monitored a census population of some 100 trees for four years, in this time 10% died, mostly the smaller individuals. Most plants consisted of multi-stemmed, regenerating stumps; the mean length of the longest stems were less than one meter. Less than half of the plants showed any growth in length during these four years, and 32% lost their primary stem, which meant the mean size of individuals within the population was decreasing. Death was not strongly related to specific location or if the plants showed disease symptoms, although stem mortality was higher with trees showing a higher severity of foliar pathogens.<ref name=Schwartz1993/> In 2000 Schwartz ''et al''. reported that despite Godfrey and Kurz's 1962 prediction, a small population size, continued population losses, and no known seed production for decades, extinction of ''T. taxifolia'' had not yet occurred, and although the population would likely steadily decline, it was unlikely to go extinct within the next 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Status===\nThis was one of the first federally listed {{C|Endangered flora of the United States|endangered plant species in the United States}} in 1984 (Federal Register 1/23/84).<ref name=FNA/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=USFWS1984/> It is one of only two species of conifer protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref name=Earle2020/> It was listed as \"[[threatened species|threatened]]\" within the state of Florida by 1987 (Florida Statutes Section 581.185),<ref name=Alfieri1987/> again in 1994 by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,<ref name=Esser1993/> and in 1998 the status in Florida was changed to \"[[endangered]]\".<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Coile1998/> In 2002 it was added to the list of \"endangered\" plants of Georgia.<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> It has been a \"[[critically endangered]]\" species on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1998, in 2000 this was said to be due to estimated 98% decline in mature individuals since the early 1950s.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=iucn2000/>\n\n===Population===\nIn 2000 Schwartz and colleagues calculated that before the start of the decline, the original population of ''T. taxifolia'' may have been 300,000 between 650,000 plants, with 357,500 individual trees being the preferred estimate, based on a historic abundance of 14.2% of dominant ravine trees in 1914, or 30 trees/ha, and a historic distribution of some {{convert|203|km2|acres}}.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> Only 27 trees were counted in Georgia in 1981.<ref name=iucn2000/> In 1993 Schwartz estimated that there were only 1500 trees in the wild.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Schwartz1993/> Based on the extrapolation of a survey of five stands of the 2000 survey, attenuated with assumptions that these stands were the most dense, Schwartz ''et al''. calculated the population in its native habitat to be between 500 and 4,000 individuals, with none capable of reproduction. The most likely population was calculated to be 1,361 individuals, not including the population west of the Apalachicola. Using their estimate of the pre-decline population, they thus calculated a minimum 98.5% decline in population over the last 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> The [[IUCN]] estimated that the population is 999 mature individuals in its native habitat (although, confusingly, it also states the population to consist of between 500 and 600 trees elsewhere in the assessment), of which less than ten were known to produce male or female cones.<ref name=iucn2010/> It stated that the population continued to decrease,<ref name=iucn2010/> although the decline may be reversible should the causes of infection be better understood.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> IUCN population viability analyses indicate that [[extinction]] within its native range is inevitable.<ref name=iucn2010/>\n\nThe IUCN stated the total [[extent of occurrence]] is estimated to be about {{convert|200|km2|acres}},<ref name=iucn2010/> this is the same as the historical distribution. Schwartz states that these has been no logging in its habitat since the 1950s and that this species has experienced no [[habitat loss]]: the vast majority of the original ravine forest habitat remains.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Threats===\nThe most significant current threat to the species is the continued reproductive failure associated with [[fungal]] pathogens.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Smith2010/> Individuals do not reach reproductive size before being top-killed.<ref name=iucn2010/> Almost no plants are able to reach a reproductive size, and where seeds do form, these are soft, crumbly and not viable.<ref name=Esser1993/> Up to ten species of fungi have been found growing in infected ''Torreya taxifolia''.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date= |title=''Fusarium torreyae'' sp nov., a pathogen causing canker disease of Florida torreya (''Torreya taxifolia''), a critically endangered conifer restricted to northern Florida and southwestern Georgia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232705140 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nAlfieri ''et al''. were able to [[Isolate (biology)|isolate]] five species of fungi in 1967 from the stems and leaves, but failed to isolate any of the fungi from the cankered stems on the media they were using, [[potato dextrose agar]]. They reported that the disease appeared to implicate species tentatively identified as ''[[Physalospora]]'' and ''[[Macrophoma]]'', but also isolated the fungi ''[[Rhizoctonia solani]]'', ''[[Sclerotium rolfsii]]'' and a ''[[Sphaeropsis]]'' species from the infected tissue.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> They attempted to reproduce the infections by spraying the isolates, as well as pulverised [[Plant litter|stem and leaf litter]], on seedlings grown in greenhouses from unaffected ornamental trees in local parks, but their experiments failed to induce the disease in their seedlings.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> Nonetheless reports from 1975 and 1988 continued to identify the responsible fungi as these previous two species.<ref name=Esser1993/> In 1985 El-Gholl was finally able to prove [[Koch's postulates]] with ''[[Gibberella baccata]]'' (as ''[[Fusarium lateritium]]'', an [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]] isolate) as the agent responsible for the leaf spot pathogen, but he was unable to replicate the disease causing the stem cankers.<ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=El-Gholl1985/><ref name=MycoBank>{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/Biolomics.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Rec=34922&Fields=All |title=''Gibberella baccata'' |last=Bensch |first=K. |date=2020 |website=MycoBank |publisher=International Mycological Association (IMA) and the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> In 1987 Alfieri ''et al''. reported on experiments with this fungus, as well as another two more species isolated from the infected plants, ''[[Xylocoremium flabelliforme]]'' (the anamorph state of ''[[Xylaria cubensis]]'') and the ''Macrophoma'' which they had re-identified as a ''[[Phyllosticta]]'' species, the anamorph form of ''[[Guignardia]]''.

Maclay Gardens State Park]] in Tallahassee.<ref name=Alfieri1987/> \n\nAccording to one older theory logging of shade trees may stress individuals of this species, which does not like being suddenly exposed to full sunlight, conducing infection.<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/>\n\nAnother threat to the population is destruction by [[White-tailed deer|deer]].<ref name=iucn2010/> Deer preferentially select young trees of this species to rub their new antlers on, sometimes killing them. Feral pigs may also uproot and destroy seedlings.<ref name=Esser1993/> Another possible cause of the historical decline may be changes in the environment due to fire suppression, and changes in water tables linked to the construction of dams.<ref name=iucn2010/> Specifically, many trees were killed when the land was flooded<ref name=Esser1993/> in the construction of the [[Jim Woodruff Dam]] impounding [[Lake Seminole]].<ref name=USBG/>\n\nAccording to one writer, the population of the species may have been impacted by postglacial [[global warming]], as it may possibly be better adapted to the cooler climate found in Florida during the last [[ice age]]. It may not have been able to move north due to poor dispersal abilities. This is based on the fact that the introduced population on the Biltmore estate in North Carolina appears to be doing fine, and is even reproducing naturally -squirrels plant the seeds in the flower beds and these germinate.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n===Actions===\n[[Fungicide]] treatment with [[Maneb]] has been shown to be remarkably effective, with plants showing renewed growth afterwards with little to no fungal infection. It has been applied since 1967,<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/> but as of 1987 it is not specifically labelled for use in ''Torreya''.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nA theory perhaps first put forward in 1990 by Greg Seamon, land manager at the [[Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve]], was that ''Torreya taxifolia'' may be somehow suffering from the suppression of fire in the upland longleaf pine-wiregrass sandhill ecosystems. However, after regular fires were again instituted in the 1990s in the preserve, this appeared not to have an effect, with the species experiencing an increased three percent annual mortality at the turn of the century.<ref name=Vaughan2001/>\n\nTwo years after declaring the species an endangered species, in 1986, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] published a recovery plan. The chief tactic was to produce a genetically diverse collection of trees for reproduction and reintroduction into the wild. Other priorities were to protect the habitat of remaining populations, and to study the disease and methods of [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/>\n\nPlants in general attract very little funding compared to [[vertebrate]]s, this tree is no different. The US federal government spent only $1,500 on conservation of the species in 1993, placing it 884th out of 926 endangered species. Schwartz ''et al''. stated that recovery is possible, but this will require a greater level of commitment and a dedicated increase in funding.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nSmall experiments by Schwartz and Hermann in the 1990s found that planting cuttings in the native habitat is possible. Schwartz ''et al''. recommended population augmentation by planting volunteers isolated by more than 100m from extant stands to reduce chance of contamination.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted for conservation purposes outside of its native range.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> Plants outside of its historic native distribution are undamaged by fungal disease and produce viable seed.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> In Tallahassee for example, not far from the native range, a number of large trees had been grown for almost a century in the Alfred B.

His parents were amateur pilots of [[Swedes|Swedish]] descent who moved from town to town to look for work, finally settling in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. His mother, who was also a painter, encouraged her son to have an artistic interest. In junior high school, Rosenquist won a short-term scholarship to study at the [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design|Minneapolis School of Art]] and subsequently studied painting at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1952 to 1954.  In 1955, at the age of 21, he moved to [[New York, New York|New York City]] on scholarship to study at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], studying under painters such as [[Edwin Dickinson]] and [[George Grosz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/|title=In the Studio: James Rosenquist|last=Kastner|first=Jeffrey|date=November 22, 2007|publisher=artinfo.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524084109/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/|archivedate=May 24, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 21, 2008}}</ref> Talking about his experience at the Art Students League, Rosenquist said \"I studied only with the abstract artists.

He started by painting [[Phillips 66]] signs, going to gas stations from North Dakota to Wisconsin. After leaving school, Rosenquist took a series of odd jobs and then turned to sign painting.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> From 1957 to 1960, Rosenquist earned his living as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] painter. Rosenquist applied sign-painting techniques to the large-scale paintings he began creating in 1960. Like other pop artists, Rosenquist adapted the visual language of advertising and [[popular culture|pop culture]] to the context of fine art.<ref>{{cite web|title= James Rosenquist, The Bird of Paradise Approaches the Hot Water Planet, 1988, Oil on canvas, 105 x 85 inches|website= www.acquavellagalleries.com |publisher=Acquavella Galleries|url=  https://www.acquavellagalleries.com/artists/james-rosenquist}}</ref>\n\"I painted billboards above every candy store in Brooklyn. \"I got so I could paint a [[Schenley Industries|Schenley]] whiskey bottle in my sleep\", he wrote in his 2009 autobiography, ''Painting Below Zero: Notes on a Life in Art''.<ref name=\"theguardian\"/> ''Time'' magazine stated that \"his powerful graphic style and painted montages helped define the 1960s Pop Art movement.\"<ref>\"Milestones James Rosenquist,\" ''Time,'' April 17, 2017, p.&nbsp;15</ref>\n\nIn 2003, art critic [[Peter Schjeldahl]] asked of Rosenquist's application of [[sign painting]] techniques to fine art thus: \"[W]as importing the method into art a bit of a cheap trick? So were Warhol's photo silk-screening and Lichtenstein's lining of panels from comic strips. The goal in all cases was to fuse painting aesthetics with the semiotics of media-drenched contemporary reality. The naked efficiency of anti-personal artmaking defines classic Pop.

Rosenquist uses icons in pop culture to examine fame and the relationship between advertising and the consumer, exploring the kind of fame and iconography that comes with American politics. With ''President Elect'', Rosenquist seeks to make a statement on the new role that advertising and mass media had during the Kennedy's campaign. \"I was very interested at that time in people who advertised themselves,\" said Rosenquist. \"Why did they put up an advertisement of themselves? So that was his face. And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece of stale cake.\" In the painting, Rosenquist contrasts the portrait of Kennedy with the cake and the Chevrolet to show how each element is marketed to American consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''F-111'': In 1965, James Rosenquist completed ''F-111'', one of the largest and most ambitious works in his collection.<ref>(n.d.).

His parents were amateur pilots of [[Swedes|Swedish]] descent who moved from town to town to look for work, finally settling in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. His mother, who was also a painter, encouraged her son to have an artistic interest. In junior high school, Rosenquist won a short-term scholarship to study at the [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design|Minneapolis School of Art]] and subsequently studied painting at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1952 to 1954.  In 1955, at the age of 21, he moved to [[New York, New York|New York City]] on scholarship to study at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], studying under painters such as [[Edwin Dickinson]] and [[George Grosz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/|title=In the Studio: James Rosenquist|last=Kastner|first=Jeffrey|date=November 22, 2007|publisher=artinfo.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524084109/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/|archivedate=May 24, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 21, 2008}}</ref> Talking about his experience at the Art Students League, Rosenquist said \"I studied only with the abstract artists.

He started by painting [[Phillips 66]] signs, going to gas stations from North Dakota to Wisconsin. After leaving school, Rosenquist took a series of odd jobs and then turned to sign painting.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> From 1957 to 1960, Rosenquist earned his living as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] painter. Rosenquist applied sign-painting techniques to the large-scale paintings he began creating in 1960. Like other pop artists, Rosenquist adapted the visual language of advertising and [[popular culture|pop culture]] to the context of fine art.<ref>{{cite web|title= James Rosenquist, The Bird of Paradise Approaches the Hot Water Planet, 1988, Oil on canvas, 105 x 85 inches|website= www.acquavellagalleries.com |publisher=Acquavella Galleries|url=  https://www.acquavellagalleries.com/artists/james-rosenquist}}</ref>\n\"I painted billboards above every candy store in Brooklyn. \"I got so I could paint a [[Schenley Industries|Schenley]] whiskey bottle in my sleep\", he wrote in his 2009 autobiography, ''Painting Below Zero: Notes on a Life in Art''.<ref name=\"theguardian\"/> ''Time'' magazine stated that \"his powerful graphic style and painted montages helped define the 1960s Pop Art movement.\"<ref>\"Milestones James Rosenquist,\" ''Time,'' April 17, 2017, p.&nbsp;15</ref>\n\nIn 2003, art critic [[Peter Schjeldahl]] asked of Rosenquist's application of [[sign painting]] techniques to fine art thus: \"[W]as importing the method into art a bit of a cheap trick? So were Warhol's photo silk-screening and Lichtenstein's lining of panels from comic strips. The goal in all cases was to fuse painting aesthetics with the semiotics of media-drenched contemporary reality. The naked efficiency of anti-personal artmaking defines classic Pop. It's as if someone were inviting you to inspect the fist with which he simultaneously punches you.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nRosenquist had his first two solo exhibitions at the [[Green Gallery]] in 1962 and 1963.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> He exhibited his painting ''F-111'', a room-scale painting, at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in 1965,<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> with which he achieved international acclaim.<ref name=\"The Permanent Collections of the Guggenheim Museums\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17bpAAAAMAAJ |title=The Permanent Collections of the Guggenheim Museums |publisher=Museo Guggenheim Bilbao |year=2007 |page=162}}</ref>\n\nBut Rosenquist said the following about his involvement in the Pop Art movement: \"They [art critics] called me a Pop artist because I used recognizable imagery. The critics like to group people together. I didn't meet [[Andy Warhol]] until 1964. I did not really know Andy or [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that well.

This includes the three-painting suite ''The Swimmer'' ''in the Econo-mist'' (1997\u20131998) for [[Deutsche Guggenheim]], Berlin, Germany, and a painting that was planned for the ceiling of the [[Palais de Chaillot]] in Paris, France.<ref name=\"nationalpost\" />\n\n== Works ==\n''Zone'': A key work in the development of his signature style, Rosenquist cites his 1961 work ''Zone'' as a turning point in the development of his own personal aesthetic, with the piece being the first to employ monumental scale, a recurring aspect of Rosenquist's art that is exemplified in his many murals.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>(March 15, 2019).

Rosenquist uses icons in pop culture to examine fame and the relationship between advertising and the consumer, exploring the kind of fame and iconography that comes with American politics. With ''President Elect'', Rosenquist seeks to make a statement on the new role that advertising and mass media had during the Kennedy's campaign. \"I was very interested at that time in people who advertised themselves,\" said Rosenquist. \"Why did they put up an advertisement of themselves? So that was his face. And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece of stale cake.\" In the painting, Rosenquist contrasts the portrait of Kennedy with the cake and the Chevrolet to show how each element is marketed to American consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''F-111'': In 1965, James Rosenquist completed ''F-111'', one of the largest and most ambitious works in his collection.<ref>(n.d.).

Rosenquist juxtaposes the imagery from the ads against the plane as a way to imply graphic scenes from the war, with broken light bulbs near the cockpit mirroring bombs dropping from the plane, and the hood of the hairdryer echoing the look of a missile.
