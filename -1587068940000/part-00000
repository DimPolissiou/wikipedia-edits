Its name derives from being a new town of the Mearns (from [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"a' Mhaoirne\" meaning a stewartry).\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 20th century, the land around Newton Mearns was primarily agricultural. Ownership passed from the [[Clan Pollock|Pollock]]s (whose name is perpetuated in the nearby Glasgow housing estate of [[Pollok]]) to the [[Clan Maxwell|Maxwell]]s of [[Caerlaverock]] around 1300. It then passed to the Maxwells of Nether Pollok in 1648 and then the [[Clan Stewart|Stewart]]s of [[Barony of Blackhall|Blackhall]] in 1660. A new [[wikt:turnpike|turnpike]] road from Eastwood Toll, now the main Ayr Road, was constructed in 1832.<ref name=\"mearnsparishkirk1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mearnsparishkirk.co.uk/html/history.html |title=History |publisher=Mearnsparishkirk.co.uk |accessdate=2009-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119143837/http://www.mearnsparishkirk.co.uk/html/history.html |archivedate=2008-11-19 }}</ref> By the end of the 18th century quarrying had developed and more importantly numerous textile mills and finishing works became established availing themselves of the numerous rivers and lochs for water supply. The 1893 'Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland' describes it as \"pleasantly situated on a rising ground 410 feet above sea-level\". It also reveals that it was a '[[burgh of barony]]' which bestowed the right to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs. However, the Gazetteer also describes the village as being only a \"single street on the Glasgow and [[Kilmarnock]] highroad\"<ref name=\"David Kidd 2001 3\">{{cite book|last=David Kidd|first=Anne Loudon|title=Old Newton Mearns|year=2001|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781840331783|page=3|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=240}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early 20th century, with the introduction of improved roads and railways to the area, it gradually became a growing commuter suburb of [[Glasgow]]. In the 1930s, between speculative and local authority housing ventures, a further 6,000 houses were added to the area and after a lull during the war years, in the 1950s, house building began again in earnest. Unfortunately, the old core village suffered neglect during and after World War II and was all but derelict by the 1960s. It was purchased and turned into a shopping centre which was later to become 'The Avenue at Mearns' in 1991.<ref name=\"David Kidd 2001 3\"/>\n\nHistorical buildings in the area include the 15th century [[Mearns Castle]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/castles/blcastles_mearns.htm |title=Scottish Castles Photo Library - Mearns Castle, East Renfrewshire |publisher=Rampantscotland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Greenbank House owned by the National Trust for Scotland (just inside neighbouring [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire|Clarkston]]) and the 1813 Mearns Kirk.<ref name=\"mearnsparishkirk1\"/>\n\n===Pollok Castle===\nGlasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD) undertook work on the [[Pollok Castle]] site and history in 2000.<ref>[http://www.damstodarnley.org/pollok-castle.htm Pollok Castle], [[Dams to Darnley Country Park]]</ref>\n\n[[File:House 2010 006.JPG|thumb|left|Pollok Castle, built 2003]]\nThe castle appears to be noted by Pont's sixteenth-century map. The castle was demolished and rebuilt as a large stately house 1686 by Sir Robert Pollok. It was completely destroyed by fire in 1882 (after remaining empty for some while) and then rebuilt again shortly after in the Scottish Baronial style. It was finally abandoned in the 1940s and fell into ruin. Some of the ruins were dynamited in the 1970s and a large prefabricated house erected on the castle foundations. The prefabricated house was removed and the site cleared in the early 1990s, and the castle was again rebuilt in 2003, in the Scottish [[Adam style]]. Some of the original foundations and castle walls remain.\n\n== Governance ==\nAt national level, Newton Mearns forms part of the [[Eastwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] constituency (since renamed to its original name of ''East Renfrewshire''), and historically, it was one of Scotland's safest [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seats.  From the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], when Barrhead and Neilston were added to the constituency, until 2015 the seat was held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. Since the 2015 UK election it has been represented by the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]'s [[Kirsten Oswald]] MP <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/kirsten-oswald/4413 |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|title=Kirsten Oswald MP|accessdate=2015-06-22}}</ref> in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. However, at the 2017 Election the seat was gained by the Conservative [[Paul Masterton]]. Kirsten Oswald regained the seat in the [[2019 UK General Election]].\n\nNewton Mearns forms part of the [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] constituency in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. The seat was held by [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour's]] [[Ken Macintosh]] from 1999, when the [[Scottish Parliament|parliament]] reconvened, until 2016. In 2016, [[Jackson Carlaw]] MSP, won the seat for the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]].\n\nFollowing the breakup of [[Strathclyde]] Regional Council in 1996, Newton Mearns became part of the new [[East Renfrewshire]] Council area.\n\nOn more than one occasion, [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow City Council]] has applied to the [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland]] to have Newton Mearns re-allocated to its control.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Councillors ===\nAs a result of the introduction of the [[Single Transferable Vote]] system for Scottish local council elections, it was planned that, in time for elections taking place in and after 2007, the town would be divided into two multi-councillor wards: ''Liboside and Newton Mearns North'' and ''Newton Mearns South''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbc-scotland.gov.uk/multimember/eastrenfrewshire/Prov%20Prop%20CE%20Ltr%2020605+appendices.htm|publisher=Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland|title='Statutory Review of Local Government Election Arrangements - East Renfrewshire council area'|accessdate=2005-08-15}}</ref> However, due to a number of complaints about the new divisions, the former was renamed ''Neilston, Uplawmoor and Newton Mearns North'', in a move to keep [[Neilston]] an integral part of the council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/collins_councillors_report_june_2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=Councillor's Report for Liboside \u2013 Ward 1|publisher=East Renfrewshire Official Website|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> The current councillors for the areas are as follows:\n\n==== Newton Mearns North and Neilston ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, there are a number of small businesses in the area, as well as an indoor [[shopping centre]].\n\nThe Avenue Shopping Centre is the main large retail centre in Newton Mearns. It comprises a total of 44 stores, currently including two supermarkets, three banks, nine clothing stores, food shops, restaurants and a library. The line of the main mall at the Avenue runs the course of the old Mearns Main Street. There are also shopping units and restaurants at Broom on the Ayr Road, shopping units and restaurants at Broomburn on the Mearns Road, and shopping units and restaurants at Crookfur on Harvie Avenue. The newly constructed Greenlaw Village close to the M77 at Crookfur Road also has two supermarkets, a hotel, smaller shops and a number of restaurants.<ref>''Newton Mearns Through Time'' by Graeme Smith and Anne Robertson, published by Amberley Publishing, 2014</ref>\n\nSome significant businesses operating within Newton Mearns are Vets 4 Pets, Claro Print, Specsavers, Edinburgh Woolen Mill, Nicol Estate Agents, Pets N Vets.\n\nFarming continues to be important to the south of Mearns Cross and stretching to Fenwick and Eaglesham Moors. A major [[Bleach]] Works and textile finishing centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/178531/ |title=Netherplace Bleachworks NMRS Number: NS55NW 87|work=[[Canmore (database)|CANMORE]]|publisher=[[RCAHMS]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref> was constructed at [[Netherplace]]. The empty building was demolished in 2016 after it was the source of a major fly infestation across Newton Mearns and Clarkston. The site where the building was is visible from the M77 motorway.\n\n== Transport ==\nTraffic through the town's A77 or Ayr Road was reduced significantly after the [[M77 motorway]] extension opened in 1997.  Transport links improved further in May 2006 with the opening of the Glasgow Southern Orbital dual carriageway, and its connection to the M77.\n\nAs well as minor and major roads, the town has bus links with the centre of [[Glasgow]], [[Kilmarnock]], and [[Ayr]]. The town is served by two local [[railway stations]], [[Patterton railway station|Patterton]] and [[Whitecraigs railway station|Whitecraigs]] which run trains to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central station]] amongst others.\n\n== Education ==\nOne factor that has made the area popular with families is the variety and quality of local schools. Mearns has nine [[primary school]]s and four [[high school]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolswebdirectory.co.uk/leasearch.php?lea=East%20Renfrewshire&submit=go|title=List Of East Renfrewshire LEA Schools|publisher=Schools Web Directory UK|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> including one [[independent school|independent]] school:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolswebdirectory.co.uk/schoolinfo2.php?ref=24820|title=List Of Independent Schools & Colleges in Renfrewshire|publisher=Schools Web Directory UK|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>The neighbouring town of Giffnock has the local catholic high school of [[St Ninians High School]].\n\n; Primary schools:\n\n* Kirkhill Primary School\n* St. Cadoc's RC Primary School\n* St Clare's Primary School and Calderwood Lodge Primary School (shared campus)\n* Crookfur Primary School\n* Mearns Primary School\n* Maidenhill Primary School\n* Belmont House School (private school)\n* Isobel Mair School for children with special needs\n\n; Secondary schools:\n\n* [[Eastwood High School (Newton Mearns, Scotland)|Eastwood High School]]\n* [[Mearns Castle High School]]\n*  Belmont House School (private school)\n*  Isobel Mair School for children with special needs\n\n== Religion ==\nNewton Mearns has numerous places of worship, notably four Church of Scotland churches, a Baptist church, a Roman Catholic church, two synagogues and a mosque. Newton Mearns South notably has the largest Jewish population of any ward in Scotland, at 8.2%.\n\n== Leisure ==\nNewton Mearns contains a number of parks, including Broom/Broomburn Park, Mearns/Shawwood Park, Crookfur Park & Parklands Country Club, and the town is adjacent to [[Rouken Glen Park]] with its boating pond, gardens and leisure facilities. There are numerous [[golf]] clubs, a golf academy, a tennis club, bowling club and rugby club. A public swimming pool and leisure centre is located at Eastwood Park in nearby Giffnock, and the swimming pool and sports centre at Eastwood High School is open to the public. Between Mearns and Barrhead lie the former reservoirs and water runs of the Gorbals Water Works, pioneered in the 19th century, before the building of the [[Loch Katrine]] Water Works. The reservoirs and surrounding parklands now form the [[Dams to Darnley Country Park]].\n\nThe biggest football club near Newton Mearns is the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Junior]] club, [[Pollok F.C.]]. The club's home stadium is situated in [[Auldhouse, Glasgow|Auldhouse]], Glasgow. Newton Mearns also has an [[Scottish Amateur Football Association|amateur]] football club, Newton Mearns Rovers AFC; Established in 1962, the club competes in the [[Caledonian Amateur Football League]].

Its name derives from being a new town of the Mearns (from [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"a' Mhaoirne\" meaning a stewartry).\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 20th century, the land around Newton Mearns was primarily agricultural. Ownership passed from the [[Clan Pollock|Pollock]]s (whose name is perpetuated in the nearby Glasgow housing estate of [[Pollok]]) to the [[Clan Maxwell|Maxwell]]s of [[Caerlaverock]] around 1300. It then passed to the Maxwells of Nether Pollok in 1648 and then the [[Clan Stewart|Stewart]]s of [[Barony of Blackhall|Blackhall]] in 1660.

The 1893 'Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland' describes it as \"pleasantly situated on a rising ground 410 feet above sea-level\". It also reveals that it was a '[[burgh of barony]]' which bestowed the right to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs. However, the Gazetteer also describes the village as being only a \"single street on the Glasgow and [[Kilmarnock]] highroad\"<ref name=\"David Kidd 2001 3\">{{cite book|last=David Kidd|first=Anne Loudon|title=Old Newton Mearns|year=2001|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781840331783|page=3|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=240}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early 20th century, with the introduction of improved roads and railways to the area, it gradually became a growing commuter suburb of [[Glasgow]]. In the 1930s, between speculative and local authority housing ventures, a further 6,000 houses were added to the area and after a lull during the war years, in the 1950s, house building began again in earnest. Unfortunately, the old core village suffered neglect during and after World War II and was all but derelict by the 1960s. It was purchased and turned into a shopping centre which was later to become 'The Avenue at Mearns' in 1991.<ref name=\"David Kidd 2001 3\"/>\n\nHistorical buildings in the area include the 15th century [[Mearns Castle]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/castles/blcastles_mearns.htm |title=Scottish Castles Photo Library - Mearns Castle, East Renfrewshire |publisher=Rampantscotland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Greenbank House owned by the National Trust for Scotland (just inside neighbouring [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire|Clarkston]]) and the 1813 Mearns Kirk.<ref name=\"mearnsparishkirk1\"/>\n\n===Pollok Castle===\nGlasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD) undertook work on the [[Pollok Castle]] site and history in 2000.<ref>[http://www.damstodarnley.org/pollok-castle.htm Pollok Castle], [[Dams to Darnley Country Park]]</ref>\n\n[[File:House 2010 006.JPG|thumb|left|Pollok Castle, built 2003]]\nThe castle appears to be noted by Pont's sixteenth-century map. The castle was demolished and rebuilt as a large stately house 1686 by Sir Robert Pollok. It was completely destroyed by fire in 1882 (after remaining empty for some while) and then rebuilt again shortly after in the Scottish Baronial style. It was finally abandoned in the 1940s and fell into ruin. Some of the ruins were dynamited in the 1970s and a large prefabricated house erected on the castle foundations. The prefabricated house was removed and the site cleared in the early 1990s, and the castle was again rebuilt in 2003, in the Scottish [[Adam style]]. Some of the original foundations and castle walls remain.\n\n== Governance ==\nAt national level, Newton Mearns forms part of the [[Eastwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] constituency (since renamed to its original name of ''East Renfrewshire''), and historically, it was one of Scotland's safest [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seats.  From the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], when Barrhead and Neilston were added to the constituency, until 2015 the seat was held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. Since the 2015 UK election it has been represented by the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]'s [[Kirsten Oswald]] MP <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/kirsten-oswald/4413 |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|title=Kirsten Oswald MP|accessdate=2015-06-22}}</ref> in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. However, at the 2017 Election the seat was gained by the Conservative [[Paul Masterton]]. Kirsten Oswald regained the seat in the [[2019 UK General Election]].\n\nNewton Mearns forms part of the [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] constituency in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. The seat was held by [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour's]] [[Ken Macintosh]] from 1999, when the [[Scottish Parliament|parliament]] reconvened, until 2016. In 2016, [[Jackson Carlaw]] MSP, won the seat for the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]].\n\nFollowing the breakup of [[Strathclyde]] Regional Council in 1996, Newton Mearns became part of the new [[East Renfrewshire]] Council area.\n\nOn more than one occasion, [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow City Council]] has applied to the [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland]] to have Newton Mearns re-allocated to its control.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Councillors ===\nAs a result of the introduction of the [[Single Transferable Vote]] system for Scottish local council elections, it was planned that, in time for elections taking place in and after 2007, the town would be divided into two multi-councillor wards: ''Liboside and Newton Mearns North'' and ''Newton Mearns South''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbc-scotland.gov.uk/multimember/eastrenfrewshire/Prov%20Prop%20CE%20Ltr%2020605+appendices.htm|publisher=Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland|title='Statutory Review of Local Government Election Arrangements - East Renfrewshire council area'|accessdate=2005-08-15}}</ref> However, due to a number of complaints about the new divisions, the former was renamed ''Neilston, Uplawmoor and Newton Mearns North'', in a move to keep [[Neilston]] an integral part of the council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/collins_councillors_report_june_2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=Councillor's Report for Liboside \u2013 Ward 1|publisher=East Renfrewshire Official Website|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> The current councillors for the areas are as follows:\n\n==== Newton Mearns North and Neilston ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, there are a number of small businesses in the area, as well as an indoor [[shopping centre]].\n\nThe Avenue Shopping Centre is the main large retail centre in Newton Mearns. It comprises a total of 44 stores, currently including two supermarkets, three banks, nine clothing stores, food shops, restaurants and a library. The line of the main mall at the Avenue runs the course of the old Mearns Main Street. There are also shopping units and restaurants at Broom on the Ayr Road, shopping units and restaurants at Broomburn on the Mearns Road, and shopping units and restaurants at Crookfur on Harvie Avenue. The newly constructed Greenlaw Village close to the M77 at Crookfur Road also has two supermarkets, a hotel, smaller shops and a number of restaurants.<ref>''Newton Mearns Through Time'' by Graeme Smith and Anne Robertson, published by Amberley Publishing, 2014</ref>\n\nSome significant businesses operating within Newton Mearns are Vets 4 Pets, Claro Print, Specsavers, Edinburgh Woolen Mill, Nicol Estate Agents, Pets N Vets.\n\nFarming continues to be important to the south of Mearns Cross and stretching to Fenwick and Eaglesham Moors. A major [[Bleach]] Works and textile finishing centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/178531/ |title=Netherplace Bleachworks NMRS Number: NS55NW 87|work=[[Canmore (database)|CANMORE]]|publisher=[[RCAHMS]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref> was constructed at [[Netherplace]]. The empty building was demolished in 2016 after it was the source of a major fly infestation across Newton Mearns and Clarkston. The site where the building was is visible from the M77 motorway.\n\n== Transport ==\nTraffic through the town's A77 or Ayr Road was reduced significantly after the [[M77 motorway]] extension opened in 1997.  Transport links improved further in May 2006 with the opening of the Glasgow Southern Orbital dual carriageway, and its connection to the M77.\n\nAs well as minor and major roads, the town has bus links with the centre of [[Glasgow]], [[Kilmarnock]], and [[Ayr]]. The town is served by two local [[railway stations]], [[Patterton railway station|Patterton]] and [[Whitecraigs railway station|Whitecraigs]] which run trains to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central station]] amongst others.\n\n== Education ==\nOne factor that has made the area popular with families is the variety and quality of local schools. Mearns has nine [[primary school]]s and four [[high school]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolswebdirectory.co.uk/leasearch.php?lea=East%20Renfrewshire&submit=go|title=List Of East Renfrewshire LEA Schools|publisher=Schools Web Directory UK|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> including one [[independent school|independent]] school:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolswebdirectory.co.uk/schoolinfo2.php?ref=24820|title=List Of Independent Schools & Colleges in Renfrewshire|publisher=Schools Web Directory UK|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>The neighbouring town of Giffnock has the local catholic high school of [[St Ninians High School]].\n\n; Primary schools:\n\n* Kirkhill Primary School\n* St. Cadoc's RC Primary School\n* St Clare's Primary School and Calderwood Lodge Primary School (shared campus)\n* Crookfur Primary School\n* Mearns Primary School\n* Maidenhill Primary School\n* Belmont House School (private school)\n* Isobel Mair School for children with special needs\n\n; Secondary schools:\n\n* [[Eastwood High School (Newton Mearns, Scotland)|Eastwood High School]]\n* [[Mearns Castle High School]]\n*  Belmont House School (private school)\n*  Isobel Mair School for children with special needs\n\n== Religion ==\nNewton Mearns has numerous places of worship, notably four Church of Scotland churches, a Baptist church, a Roman Catholic church, two synagogues and a mosque. Newton Mearns South notably has the largest Jewish population of any ward in Scotland, at 8.2%.\n\n== Leisure ==\nNewton Mearns contains a number of parks, including Broom/Broomburn Park, Mearns/Shawwood Park, Crookfur Park & Parklands Country Club, and the town is adjacent to [[Rouken Glen Park]] with its boating pond, gardens and leisure facilities. There are numerous [[golf]] clubs, a golf academy, a tennis club, bowling club and rugby club. A public swimming pool and leisure centre is located at Eastwood Park in nearby Giffnock, and the swimming pool and sports centre at Eastwood High School is open to the public. Between Mearns and Barrhead lie the former reservoirs and water runs of the Gorbals Water Works, pioneered in the 19th century, before the building of the [[Loch Katrine]] Water Works. The reservoirs and surrounding parklands now form the [[Dams to Darnley Country Park]].\n\nThe biggest football club near Newton Mearns is the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Junior]] club, [[Pollok F.C.]]. The club's home stadium is situated in [[Auldhouse, Glasgow|Auldhouse]], Glasgow. Newton Mearns also has an [[Scottish Amateur Football Association|amateur]] football club, Newton Mearns Rovers AFC; Established in 1962, the club competes in the [[Caledonian Amateur Football League]]. Newton Mearns has a [[Freemason]]s' lodge, Lodge Newton Mearns No 1706, that meets in the Fairweather Hall on Barrhead Road.\n\n== Literature ==\nNewton Mearns was briefly mentioned in John McGrath's play ''Little Red Hen'' (1975, first publ.

As a child, she studied music, drama and dance at Chicago's Lincoln Center. In her teen years, she sang lead vocals for the Chicago-based girl group the Gems. Her early affiliation with the legendary Chicago-based [[Chess Records]] afforded her the opportunity to sing backup for various established artists such as [[Etta James]], [[Fontella Bass]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Muddy Waters]]. While at Chess, Riperton also sang lead for the [[experimental rock]]/soul group [[Rotary Connection]], from 1967 to 1971.\n\nOn April 5, 1975, Riperton reached the apex of her career with her No. 1 single \"Lovin' You\". The single was the last release from her 1974 gold album titled ''[[Perfect Angel]]''. In January 1976, Riperton was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], and in April, she underwent a [[radical mastectomy]].<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite episode|title= Unsung: The Minnie Riperton Story|network=Cable Network=TV-ONE|series=Unsung: The Minnie Riperton Story|airdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rockwell|first=John|date=May 11, 1977|title=Minnie Riperton: The octave lady composes songs, too|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLUsAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA4|work=[[Star-News|Wilmington Morning Star]]|page=7|access-date=March 26, 2019|quote=\"I had a mastectomy the day after Easter last year.\"}}</ref> By the time of [[diagnosis]], the cancer had [[metastasized]] and she was given about six months to live.

She was one of the first celebrities to go public with a breast cancer diagnosis, but she did not disclose that she was [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. In 1977, she became a spokesperson for the [[American Cancer Society]]. In 1978, she received the American Cancer Society's Courage Award, which was presented to her at the White House by President [[Jimmy Carter]].

Although she began with [[ballet]] and modern dance, her parents recognized her vocal and musical abilities and encouraged her to pursue music and voice. At Chicago's Lincoln Center, she received operatic vocal training from Marion Jeffery. She practiced breathing and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], with particular emphasis on diction. Jeffery also trained Riperton to use her full range. While studying under Jeffery, she sang [[operetta]]s and [[show tune]]s, in preparation for a career in opera. Jeffery was so convinced of her pupil's abilities that she strongly pushed her to further study the classics at Chicago's Junior Lyric Opera. The young Riperton was, however, becoming interested in [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll|rock]]. After graduating from Hyde Park High School (now [[Hyde Park Academy High School]]), she enrolled at [[Harold Washington College|Loop College]] and became a member of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority. She dropped out of college to pursue her music career.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nRiperton's first professional singing engagement was with The Gems, when she was 15. Raynard Miner, a blind pianist, heard her singing during her stint with Hyde Park's [[A cappella|A Cappella]] Choir and became her musical patron. The Gems had relatively limited commercial success, but proved to be a good outlet for Riperton's talent. Eventually the group became a session group known as Studio Three and it was during this period that they provided the backing vocals on the classic 1965 [[Fontella Bass]] hit \"[[Rescue Me (Fontella Bass song)|Rescue Me]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/~andrycoc/fontella.html |title=Sorry, We Can't Find That Page - Search MSU |publisher=Msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> In 1964, The Gems released a local hit, ''I Can't Help Myself'', and their last single, ''He Makes Me Feel So Good'', was released in 1965. The Gems later released records under numerous names\u2014most notably 1966's ''Baby I Want You'' by the Girls Three and 1967's ''My Baby's Real'' by the Starlets. The latter has achieved cult status with [[northern soul]] fans and remains a favorite. It was a Motown-style song reminiscent of [[Tammi Terrell]]. In 1968, ''Watered Down'' was released as a follow-up, under the name The Starlets. It was the last release of Riperton's former girl group. While a part of Studio Three, Riperton met her mentor, producer [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]], who wrote her first local hit, \"Lonely Girl\", as well as \"You Gave Me Soul\". In honor of Davis, she used the pseudonym Andrea Davis for the release of those two singles. Some months after her Andrea Davis singles hit radio, Riperton joined [[Rotary Connection]], a [[funk]]y rock-soul group creation of [[Marshall Chess]], the son of [[Chess Records]] founder [[Leonard Chess]]. Rotary Connection consisted of Riperton, Chess, Judy Hauff, Sidney Barnes, and Charles Stepney. They released [[Rotary Connection (album)|their debut]] in 1967 and, eventually, five more albums: 1968's ''Aladdin''; the Christmas album ''Peace''; ''Songs''; and finally 1970's ''Dinner Music'' and ''Hey Love''.\n\nIn 1969 Riperton, along with Rotary Connection, played in the first Catholic Rock Mass at the Liturgical Conference National Convention, Milwaukee Arena, [[Milwaukee, WI]], produced by [[James F. Colaianni]].\n\n===''Come to My Garden''===\nRiperton's debut solo album entitled ''[[Come to My Garden]]'' was produced, arranged, as well as orchestrated by [[Charles Stepney (producer)|Charles Stepney]] and released in 1970 by GRT Records. She was presented as a solo artist by [[Ramsey Lewis]] on Saturday, December 26, 1970 at Chicago's famed [[The London House, Chicago|London House]]. Riperton went on to perform several numbers from the album while accompanied by Stepney. Although commercially unsuccessful, ''Come to My Garden'' is now considered a masterpiece by music critics and many others in the music industry.<ref name=\"ref1\"/>\n\n===''Perfect Angel'' and \"Lovin' You\"===\n{{Main|Lovin' You}}\nIn 1973, a college intern for [[Epic Records]] found Riperton in semi-retirement. She had become a homemaker and a mother of two in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. After he heard a demo of the song \"Seeing You This Way\", the rep took the tape to Don Ellis, VP of [[A&R]] for Epic. Riperton signed with Epic Records, and the family moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The subsequent record, ''[[Perfect Angel]]'', turned out to be one of Riperton's best-selling albums. Included were the rock-soul anthem \"Reasons\"; the second single, \"Take a Little Trip\" (written by Stevie Wonder, who also coproduced the album); and the third single, \"Seeing You This Way\".\nSales of the album started out slow. Epic was ready to move on to the next record, but Rudolph convinced them to release another single. With the fourth single, \"[[Lovin' You]]\", the album caught on, and in April 1975, the song went to the top of the charts in the U.S. and 24 other countries. The song reached no. 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and number three on the U.S. R&B charts. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in April 1975.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/363 363]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/363\n}}</ref> ''Perfect Angel'' went gold and Riperton was finally revered as the \"lady with the high voice and flowers in her hair.\" The album also featured the song \"Every Time He Comes Around\", with [[Deniece Williams]] singing the background vocals. \n\n===Later career===\nAfter ''Perfect Angel'', Riperton and Richard Rudolph started on Riperton's third album, ''[[Adventures in Paradise (Minnie Riperton album)|Adventures in Paradise]]'' (1975). [[Joe Sample]] of [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|The Crusaders]] cowrote the title song, \"Adventures in Paradise\", and Crusaders producer [[Stewart Levine]] co-produced the album. While shooting a promotional clip for the album, she was attacked by a lion, but was not seriously injured. During an appearance on ''The Sammy Davis, Jr. Show'', she played the footage of the incident for Sammy and her fellow guests, including [[Richard Pryor]]. The album was a modest success. Despite the R&B hit \"[[Inside My Love]]\" (a no. 5 U.S. R&B hit, later covered by [[Trina Broussard]], [[Chant\u00e9 Moore]], and [[Delilah (musician)|Delilah]]), the album did not match the success of ''Perfect Angel''. Some radio stations refused to play \"Inside My Love\" due to the lyrics: \"Will you come inside me?\"\n\nHer fourth album for Epic Records, titled ''[[Stay in Love]]'', featured another collaboration with [[Stevie Wonder]] in the funky disco tune \"Stick Together\". She also sang backup on Wonder's songs \"Creepin'\" from 1974's ''[[Fullfillingness' First Finale]]'' and \"Ordinary Pain\" from 1976's ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' and was mentioned prominently in his song \"Positivity\" on ''[[A Time to Love (album)|A Time to Love]]''. In 1977, Riperton lent her vocal abilities to a track named \"Yesterday and Karma\", on [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s album, \"Osamu\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Osamu&nbsp;\u2013 Osamu Kitajima : Credits : AllMusic:|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/osamu-mw0000849567/credits}}</ref> In 1978, Riperton's attorney Mike Rosenfeld and her husband, [[Richard Rudolph]], orchestrated a move to [[Capitol Records]] for Riperton and her CBS Records catalog. In April 1979, Riperton released her fifth and final album, ''[[Minnie (album)|Minnie]]''. During the recording of the album, her cancer progressed to the point that she was in a great deal of pain.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> \"[[Minnie (album)|Memory Lane]]\" was a hit from the album. \n\n==Personal life==\nRiperton was married to songwriter and music producer [[Richard Rudolph]] from August 1970 until her death in July 1979. Together, Riperton and Rudolph had two children; music engineer Marc Rudolph (b. 1968) and actress/comedian [[Maya Rudolph]] (b. 1972).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Robert E.|date=1979-09-06|title=Minnie's Family Faces the Future With her Dreams|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=56|issue=255|pages=53\u201354|issn=0021-5996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yn2aYTGaVQsC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yn2aYTGaVQsC/page/n92 95]|quote=minnie riperton.|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 October 1979|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=28 July 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Maya Rudolph was a child when \"[[Lovin' You]]\" was recorded. According to the liner notes from Riperton's ''Petals'' compilation CD, the melody to \"Lovin' You\" was created as a distraction for Maya when she was a baby so Riperton and Richard Rudolph could spend time together.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> \n\n===Illness and death===\n[[Image:Minnie Riperton grave.jpg|right|thumb|Riperton's grave at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]]]]\nOn August 24, 1976, Riperton revealed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that she had undergone a [[mastectomy]] due to [[breast cancer]].<ref name=\"ref1\"/> At the time of her diagnosis, Riperton found out her [[cancer]] had already spread to the [[lymphatic system]], and was given about six months to live.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> She continued touring in 1977 and 1978, and became the national spokeswoman for the [[American Cancer Society]]'s 1978\u201379 campaign.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Extreme [[lymphedema]] immobilized her right arm in early 1979. In her final singing appearances on television (most notably on the ''[[Mike Douglas Show]]''), her right arm remained in a fixed position during her performances.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Near the end of the unedited \"Lovin' You\", Riperton sings \"Maya, Maya, Maya\"; in concert, near her death, she changed this to \"Maya, Maya, Ringo, Maya.\" Ringo was her nickname for her son, Marc.\n\nBy mid-June, Riperton was confined to bed. She entered [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles on July 10. On Thursday, July 12 at 10:00 am, she died in the arms of her husband. That Sunday, following a funeral service attended by more than five hundred mourners, Riperton was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Her epitaph is the opening line of her most famous song: \"Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful\".\n\n==Posthumous releases==\nAfter Riperton died, several artists contributed vocals to tracks she had recorded before her death, to help compile Richard Rudolph's final tribute to his wife, ''[[Love Lives Forever]]''. Included, among others, were [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Stevie Wonder]]. Riperton's last single, \"Give Me Time,\" was released in 1980. [[Richard Rudolph]] wrote the song, \"Now That I Have You\" for her, but she never got the chance to record it; he gave the song to [[Teena Marie]], who recorded it (and co-produced it with Rudolph) on Marie's second LP, ''[[Lady T (album)|Lady T]]''. Finally, in 1981, Capitol Records released ''[[The Best of Minnie Riperton]]'', a greatest hits collection. The \"new\" song on the album was a remake of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"A Woman of Heart and Mind,\" which was a holdover from the ''[[Minnie (album)|Minnie]]'' sessions. Also included were an alternate mix of \"Memory Lane\"; live versions of \"Can You Feel What I'm Saying,\" \"Lover And Friend,\" and \"Young, Willing, and Able\"; and two \"Moments with Minnie.\" It also included the hits \"Perfect Angel,\" \"Lovin' You,\" \"Inside My Love,\" \"Adventures In Paradise,\" and two tracks from ''Love Lives Forever'': the single \"Here We Go\" (a duet with [[Peabo Bryson]]),<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-lives-forever/714616058 |date=October 22, 1977 |accessdate=May 22, 2017 |title=Love Lives Forever - Minnie Riperton |author=Apple Inc.}}</ref> and the song \"You Take My Breath Away.\"\nDuring the 1990s, Riperton's music was sampled by many rap and hip-hop artists, including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Blumentopf]], [[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld|The Orb]] and [[Tragedy Khadafi]].<ref name=\"ref1\"/>\n\n==Vocal ability==\nRiperton had a [[coloratura soprano]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=1335 |title=SoulMusic.com |publisher=SoulMusic.com |accessdate=2014-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322212510/http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=1335 |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> Aside from her various hits, she is perhaps best remembered today for her ability to sing in high [[head voice]] (occasionally the [[whistle register]] which is often mistakenly confused with the former), in which she had rare facility.<ref>{{cite book| last1= Bogdanov| first1= Vladimir| last2= Woodstra| first2= Chris| last3= Erlewine|first3=Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide To Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|edition=3|year=2002|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-653-X|page=944}}</ref> She is known as The Nightingale, and a Songbird. Her rare ability to enunciate in the high registers set her apart from most other whistle-register singers. This feature is most notably heard in the song \"Here We Go\" (a duet with [[Peabo Bryson]]),<ref name=\"apple\"/> where she sings \"here we go\" in the whistle register. Whistle-register enunciation can also be heard in songs such as \"Inside My Love,\" \"Adventures in Paradise,\" \"Expecting,\" \"Only When I'm Dreaming,\" and also in \"Teach Me How to Fly\" and \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" with the [[Rotary Connection]].\n\nRiperton was also noted for her ability to sound almost mechanical or instrumental in the high head voice and whistle. In \"You Take My Breath Away,\" she sang a ''[[portamento]]'' ending two octaves above the staff. She has also been credited for her ability to sustain notes in the sixth and seventh octave for long periods of time, as in \"Reasons,\" \"Could It Be I'm in Love,\" \"Adventures in Paradise,\" and \"Inside My Love,\" and also \"Love Me Now\" with the Rotary Connection. Having an innate ability to imitate many instruments helped lead to Riperton's discovery while she was a secretary at Chess Records.\n\nIn her recordings, Riperton's highest recorded note reached in the whistle register was F7 on the third scale of \"You Take My Breath Away.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Riperton reached this extremely high note before on an early recording of \"Teach Me How to Fly\" and \"Could It Be I'm in Love.\" Also in a live performance of the song \"Ruby Tuesday\" from Rotary Connection, she sang an F#7. In the song \"Loving You\" she sings a [[walkdown]] on the A Major scale from F#6 to A5.

As a child, she studied music, drama and dance at Chicago's Lincoln Center. In her teen years, she sang lead vocals for the Chicago-based girl group the Gems. Her early affiliation with the legendary Chicago-based [[Chess Records]] afforded her the opportunity to sing backup for various established artists such as [[Etta James]], [[Fontella Bass]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Muddy Waters]]. While at Chess, Riperton also sang lead for the [[experimental rock]]/soul group [[Rotary Connection]], from 1967 to 1971.\n\nOn April 5, 1975, Riperton reached the apex of her career with her No. 1 single \"Lovin' You\". The single was the last release from her 1974 gold album titled ''[[Perfect Angel]]''. In January 1976, Riperton was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], and in April, she underwent a [[radical mastectomy]].<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite episode|title= Unsung: The Minnie Riperton Story|network=Cable Network=TV-ONE|series=Unsung: The Minnie Riperton Story|airdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rockwell|first=John|date=May 11, 1977|title=Minnie Riperton: The octave lady composes songs, too|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLUsAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA4|work=[[Star-News|Wilmington Morning Star]]|page=7|access-date=March 26, 2019|quote=\"I had a mastectomy the day after Easter last year.\"}}</ref> By the time of [[diagnosis]], the cancer had [[metastasized]] and she was given about six months to live. Despite the grim [[prognosis]], she continued recording and touring. She was one of the first celebrities to go public with a breast cancer diagnosis, but she did not disclose that she was [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. In 1977, she became a spokesperson for the [[American Cancer Society]]. In 1978, she received the American Cancer Society's Courage Award, which was presented to her at the White House by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Riperton died of cancer on July 12, 1979 at age 31.\n\n==Early life==\nRiperton was born in Chicago, the daughter of Thelma Inez (n\u00e9e Matthews) (1911\u20132005) and Salleh Riperton (1899\u20131991), a [[Pullman porter]].<ref>[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/entertainment/blackmusicmonth/minnieriperton620] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705070522/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/entertainment/blackmusicmonth/minnieriperton620|date=July 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', January 19, 2016, PBS</ref> The youngest of eight children in a musical family, she embraced the arts early. Although she began with [[ballet]] and modern dance, her parents recognized her vocal and musical abilities and encouraged her to pursue music and voice. At Chicago's Lincoln Center, she received operatic vocal training from Marion Jeffery. She practiced breathing and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], with particular emphasis on diction. Jeffery also trained Riperton to use her full range. While studying under Jeffery, she sang [[operetta]]s and [[show tune]]s, in preparation for a career in opera. Jeffery was so convinced of her pupil's abilities that she strongly pushed her to further study the classics at Chicago's Junior Lyric Opera. The young Riperton was, however, becoming interested in [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll|rock]]. After graduating from Hyde Park High School (now [[Hyde Park Academy High School]]), she enrolled at [[Harold Washington College|Loop College]] and became a member of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority. She dropped out of college to pursue her music career.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nRiperton's first professional singing engagement was with The Gems, when she was 15. Raynard Miner, a blind pianist, heard her singing during her stint with Hyde Park's [[A cappella|A Cappella]] Choir and became her musical patron. The Gems had relatively limited commercial success, but proved to be a good outlet for Riperton's talent. Eventually the group became a session group known as Studio Three and it was during this period that they provided the backing vocals on the classic 1965 [[Fontella Bass]] hit \"[[Rescue Me (Fontella Bass song)|Rescue Me]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/~andrycoc/fontella.html |title=Sorry, We Can't Find That Page - Search MSU |publisher=Msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> In 1964, The Gems released a local hit, ''I Can't Help Myself'', and their last single, ''He Makes Me Feel So Good'', was released in 1965. The Gems later released records under numerous names\u2014most notably 1966's ''Baby I Want You'' by the Girls Three and 1967's ''My Baby's Real'' by the Starlets. The latter has achieved cult status with [[northern soul]] fans and remains a favorite. It was a Motown-style song reminiscent of [[Tammi Terrell]]. In 1968, ''Watered Down'' was released as a follow-up, under the name The Starlets. It was the last release of Riperton's former girl group. While a part of Studio Three, Riperton met her mentor, producer [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]], who wrote her first local hit, \"Lonely Girl\", as well as \"You Gave Me Soul\". In honor of Davis, she used the pseudonym Andrea Davis for the release of those two singles. Some months after her Andrea Davis singles hit radio, Riperton joined [[Rotary Connection]], a [[funk]]y rock-soul group creation of [[Marshall Chess]], the son of [[Chess Records]] founder [[Leonard Chess]]. Rotary Connection consisted of Riperton, Chess, Judy Hauff, Sidney Barnes, and Charles Stepney. They released [[Rotary Connection (album)|their debut]] in 1967 and, eventually, five more albums: 1968's ''Aladdin''; the Christmas album ''Peace''; ''Songs''; and finally 1970's ''Dinner Music'' and ''Hey Love''.\n\nIn 1969 Riperton, along with Rotary Connection, played in the first Catholic Rock Mass at the Liturgical Conference National Convention, Milwaukee Arena, [[Milwaukee, WI]], produced by [[James F. Colaianni]].\n\n===''Come to My Garden''===\nRiperton's debut solo album entitled ''[[Come to My Garden]]'' was produced, arranged, as well as orchestrated by [[Charles Stepney (producer)|Charles Stepney]] and released in 1970 by GRT Records. She was presented as a solo artist by [[Ramsey Lewis]] on Saturday, December 26, 1970 at Chicago's famed [[The London House, Chicago|London House]]. Riperton went on to perform several numbers from the album while accompanied by Stepney. Although commercially unsuccessful, ''Come to My Garden'' is now considered a masterpiece by music critics and many others in the music industry.<ref name=\"ref1\"/>\n\n===''Perfect Angel'' and \"Lovin' You\"===\n{{Main|Lovin' You}}\nIn 1973, a college intern for [[Epic Records]] found Riperton in semi-retirement. She had become a homemaker and a mother of two in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. After he heard a demo of the song \"Seeing You This Way\", the rep took the tape to Don Ellis, VP of [[A&R]] for Epic. Riperton signed with Epic Records, and the family moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The subsequent record, ''[[Perfect Angel]]'', turned out to be one of Riperton's best-selling albums. Included were the rock-soul anthem \"Reasons\"; the second single, \"Take a Little Trip\" (written by Stevie Wonder, who also coproduced the album); and the third single, \"Seeing You This Way\".\nSales of the album started out slow. Epic was ready to move on to the next record, but Rudolph convinced them to release another single. With the fourth single, \"[[Lovin' You]]\", the album caught on, and in April 1975, the song went to the top of the charts in the U.S. and 24 other countries. The song reached no. 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and number three on the U.S. R&B charts. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in April 1975.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/363 363]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/363\n}}</ref> ''Perfect Angel'' went gold and Riperton was finally revered as the \"lady with the high voice and flowers in her hair.\" The album also featured the song \"Every Time He Comes Around\", with [[Deniece Williams]] singing the background vocals. \n\n===Later career===\nAfter ''Perfect Angel'', Riperton and Richard Rudolph started on Riperton's third album, ''[[Adventures in Paradise (Minnie Riperton album)|Adventures in Paradise]]'' (1975). [[Joe Sample]] of [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|The Crusaders]] cowrote the title song, \"Adventures in Paradise\", and Crusaders producer [[Stewart Levine]] co-produced the album. While shooting a promotional clip for the album, she was attacked by a lion, but was not seriously injured. During an appearance on ''The Sammy Davis, Jr. Show'', she played the footage of the incident for Sammy and her fellow guests, including [[Richard Pryor]]. The album was a modest success. Despite the R&B hit \"[[Inside My Love]]\" (a no. 5 U.S. R&B hit, later covered by [[Trina Broussard]], [[Chant\u00e9 Moore]], and [[Delilah (musician)|Delilah]]), the album did not match the success of ''Perfect Angel''. Some radio stations refused to play \"Inside My Love\" due to the lyrics: \"Will you come inside me?\"\n\nHer fourth album for Epic Records, titled ''[[Stay in Love]]'', featured another collaboration with [[Stevie Wonder]] in the funky disco tune \"Stick Together\". She also sang backup on Wonder's songs \"Creepin'\" from 1974's ''[[Fullfillingness' First Finale]]'' and \"Ordinary Pain\" from 1976's ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' and was mentioned prominently in his song \"Positivity\" on ''[[A Time to Love (album)|A Time to Love]]''. In 1977, Riperton lent her vocal abilities to a track named \"Yesterday and Karma\", on [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s album, \"Osamu\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Osamu&nbsp;\u2013 Osamu Kitajima : Credits : AllMusic:|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/osamu-mw0000849567/credits}}</ref> In 1978, Riperton's attorney Mike Rosenfeld and her husband, [[Richard Rudolph]], orchestrated a move to [[Capitol Records]] for Riperton and her CBS Records catalog. In April 1979, Riperton released her fifth and final album, ''[[Minnie (album)|Minnie]]''. During the recording of the album, her cancer progressed to the point that she was in a great deal of pain.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> \"[[Minnie (album)|Memory Lane]]\" was a hit from the album. \n\n==Personal life==\nRiperton was married to songwriter and music producer [[Richard Rudolph]] from August 1970 until her death in July 1979. Together, Riperton and Rudolph had two children; music engineer Marc Rudolph (b. 1968) and actress/comedian [[Maya Rudolph]] (b. 1972).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Robert E.|date=1979-09-06|title=Minnie's Family Faces the Future With her Dreams|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=56|issue=255|pages=53\u201354|issn=0021-5996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yn2aYTGaVQsC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yn2aYTGaVQsC/page/n92 95]|quote=minnie riperton.|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 October 1979|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=28 July 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Maya Rudolph was a child when \"[[Lovin' You]]\" was recorded. According to the liner notes from Riperton's ''Petals'' compilation CD, the melody to \"Lovin' You\" was created as a distraction for Maya when she was a baby so Riperton and Richard Rudolph could spend time together.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> \n\n===Illness and death===\n[[Image:Minnie Riperton grave.jpg|right|thumb|Riperton's grave at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]]]]\nOn August 24, 1976, Riperton revealed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that she had undergone a [[mastectomy]] due to [[breast cancer]].<ref name=\"ref1\"/> At the time of her diagnosis, Riperton found out her [[cancer]] had already spread to the [[lymphatic system]], and was given about six months to live.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> She continued touring in 1977 and 1978, and became the national spokeswoman for the [[American Cancer Society]]'s 1978\u201379 campaign.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Extreme [[lymphedema]] immobilized her right arm in early 1979. In her final singing appearances on television (most notably on the ''[[Mike Douglas Show]]''), her right arm remained in a fixed position during her performances.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Near the end of the unedited \"Lovin' You\", Riperton sings \"Maya, Maya, Maya\"; in concert, near her death, she changed this to \"Maya, Maya, Ringo, Maya.\" Ringo was her nickname for her son, Marc.\n\nBy mid-June, Riperton was confined to bed. She entered [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles on July 10. On Thursday, July 12 at 10:00 am, she died in the arms of her husband. That Sunday, following a funeral service attended by more than five hundred mourners, Riperton was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Her epitaph is the opening line of her most famous song: \"Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful\".\n\n==Posthumous releases==\nAfter Riperton died, several artists contributed vocals to tracks she had recorded before her death, to help compile Richard Rudolph's final tribute to his wife, ''[[Love Lives Forever]]''. Included, among others, were [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Stevie Wonder]]. Riperton's last single, \"Give Me Time,\" was released in 1980. [[Richard Rudolph]] wrote the song, \"Now That I Have You\" for her, but she never got the chance to record it; he gave the song to [[Teena Marie]], who recorded it (and co-produced it with Rudolph) on Marie's second LP, ''[[Lady T (album)|Lady T]]''. Finally, in 1981, Capitol Records released ''[[The Best of Minnie Riperton]]'', a greatest hits collection. The \"new\" song on the album was a remake of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"A Woman of Heart and Mind,\" which was a holdover from the ''[[Minnie (album)|Minnie]]'' sessions. Also included were an alternate mix of \"Memory Lane\"; live versions of \"Can You Feel What I'm Saying,\" \"Lover And Friend,\" and \"Young, Willing, and Able\"; and two \"Moments with Minnie.\" It also included the hits \"Perfect Angel,\" \"Lovin' You,\" \"Inside My Love,\" \"Adventures In Paradise,\" and two tracks from ''Love Lives Forever'': the single \"Here We Go\" (a duet with [[Peabo Bryson]]),<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-lives-forever/714616058 |date=October 22, 1977 |accessdate=May 22, 2017 |title=Love Lives Forever - Minnie Riperton |author=Apple Inc.}}</ref> and the song \"You Take My Breath Away.\"\nDuring the 1990s, Riperton's music was sampled by many rap and hip-hop artists, including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Blumentopf]], [[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld|The Orb]] and [[Tragedy Khadafi]].<ref name=\"ref1\"/>\n\n==Vocal ability==\nRiperton had a [[coloratura soprano]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=1335 |title=SoulMusic.com |publisher=SoulMusic.com |accessdate=2014-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322212510/http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=1335 |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> Aside from her various hits, she is perhaps best remembered today for her ability to sing in high [[head voice]] (occasionally the [[whistle register]] which is often mistakenly confused with the former), in which she had rare facility.<ref>{{cite book| last1= Bogdanov| first1= Vladimir| last2= Woodstra| first2= Chris| last3= Erlewine|first3=Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide To Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|edition=3|year=2002|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-653-X|page=944}}</ref> She is known as The Nightingale, and a Songbird. Her rare ability to enunciate in the high registers set her apart from most other whistle-register singers. This feature is most notably heard in the song \"Here We Go\" (a duet with [[Peabo Bryson]]),<ref name=\"apple\"/> where she sings \"here we go\" in the whistle register. Whistle-register enunciation can also be heard in songs such as \"Inside My Love,\" \"Adventures in Paradise,\" \"Expecting,\" \"Only When I'm Dreaming,\" and also in \"Teach Me How to Fly\" and \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" with the [[Rotary Connection]].\n\nRiperton was also noted for her ability to sound almost mechanical or instrumental in the high head voice and whistle. In \"You Take My Breath Away,\" she sang a ''[[portamento]]'' ending two octaves above the staff. She has also been credited for her ability to sustain notes in the sixth and seventh octave for long periods of time, as in \"Reasons,\" \"Could It Be I'm in Love,\" \"Adventures in Paradise,\" and \"Inside My Love,\" and also \"Love Me Now\" with the Rotary Connection. Having an innate ability to imitate many instruments helped lead to Riperton's discovery while she was a secretary at Chess Records.\n\nIn her recordings, Riperton's highest recorded note reached in the whistle register was F7 on the third scale of \"You Take My Breath Away.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Riperton reached this extremely high note before on an early recording of \"Teach Me How to Fly\" and \"Could It Be I'm in Love.\" Also in a live performance of the song \"Ruby Tuesday\" from Rotary Connection, she sang an F#7. In the song \"Loving You\" she sings a [[walkdown]] on the A Major scale from F#6 to A5. [[Mariah Carey]] cited Riperton as an influence on her.<ref>{{cite interview| date= November 1998 |interviewer= Danyel Smith | first= Mariah| last= Carey| authorlink= Mariah Carey| title= Higher and Higher| url= http://mariahcareynetwork.com/magazines/vibe98.html|  work= [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]| publisher= | access-date= March 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Documentary and tributes==\nSinger [[Stevie Wonder]] paid tribute to Riperton during an episode of the TV show ''[[Soul Train]]'', which aired shortly after her death in September 1979.<ref>{{cite episode| url= http://www.tv.com/shows/soul-train/a-tribute-to-minnie-riperton-with-stevie-wonder-and-wintley-phipps-114047/ |title= A Tribue to Minnie Riperton with Stevie Wonder and Wintley Phipps| series= [[Soul Train]] |season= 9 |number= 1| date= September 15, 1979}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 2009, TV One (US TV network's) ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]'' series premi\u00e8red a one-hour documentary on Riperton's career and life.
