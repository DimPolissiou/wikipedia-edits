{"title_page": "Sri Sarada Math", "text_new": "== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established under the wings of Ramakrishna Order. \n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Revered Swami Sankarananda.  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of Ramakrishna devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They had intense dispassion for the world. \n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, \u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019 published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of Belur Math assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates if the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were Pravrajika Bharatiprana, Pravrajika Mokshaprana, Pravrajika Muktiprana, Pravrajika Dayaprana, Pravrajika Vidyaprana, Pravrajika Shraddhaprana, Pravrajika Bhaktiprana, and Pravrajika Medhaprana. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of Sannyasa to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri Sankaracharya did not sanction sannyasa for women. But by his love and grace, Swami Vivekananda laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri Sampradaya, one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami Sampradaya started by Sankaracharya. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central Kolkata were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the Ramakrishna Mission authorities handed over the Sister Nivedita Girls School to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the Ramakrishna Math designed by Swami Vivekananda was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math\u2019s emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen. \nThe motto of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Presidents ==\nThe first president of the Math was Pravrajika Bharatiprana. Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of Sri Sarada Devi. Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, Sarala Devi lived in Varanasi from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines. She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from Swami Saradananda. Assuming the leadership of the Sri Sarada Math, Bharatiprana served from December 1954 to January 1973, till her Mahasamadhi. \nHer pious life was written in Bengali as Bharatiprana Smriti Katha and later translated in English by Pravrajika Atmaprana as Pravrajika Bharatiprana. \n\n== The Idea ==\nThe idea to form a monastic institution for women was first envisioned by Swami Vivekananda, long before he established the well-known Ramakrishna Math. Swami Vivekananda realized the dire necessity of women\u2019s Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901. \n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\nMother has been born to revive\u2026Shakti in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will Gargis and Maitreyis be born into the world\u2026 Hence it is her Math that I want first\u2026 Without the grace of Shakti nothing is to be accomplished\u2026.

It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with many regarding it as a welcome return to form for Ritchie, while some are troubled by its racist undertones. It grossed $117 million worldwide, and is currently the [[2020 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2020]].\n\n==Plot==\nBig Dave, editor of the ''Daily Print'' [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], is snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|Royal Duke]] with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled ''Bush'') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000.\n\nBorn in poverty in the United States, Pearson won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he began selling marijuana to privileged fellow students before dropping out and building up his criminal enterprise by violence. He plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their [[English country house|stately homes]]. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.\n\nPearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a [[council estate]] where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Laura later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt when he jumps off a balcony but lands into the path of an oncoming train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead.\n\nUnknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two-shot [[derringer]]. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\n\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him [[Zoophilia|having sex with a pig]], threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000 but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a [[pound of flesh]]\" from his own body.\n\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a [[Russian oligarch]] and former KGB agent. The assassin that Raymond earlier killed was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are quickly ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to [[Miramax]].

It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with many regarding it as a welcome return to form for Ritchie, and grossed $117 million worldwide. It is currently the [[2020 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2020]].\n\n==Plot==\nBig Dave, editor of the ''Daily Print'' [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], is snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|Royal Duke]] with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled ''Bush'') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000.\n\nBorn in poverty in the United States, Pearson won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he began selling marijuana to privileged fellow students before dropping out and building up his criminal enterprise by violence. He plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their [[English country house|stately homes]]. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.\n\nPearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a [[council estate]] where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Laura later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt when he jumps off a balcony but lands into the path of an oncoming train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead.\n\nUnknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two-shot [[derringer]]. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\n\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him [[Zoophilia|having sex with a pig]], threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000 but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a [[pound of flesh]]\" from his own body.\n\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a [[Russian oligarch]] and former KGB agent. The assassin that Raymond earlier killed was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are quickly ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to [[Miramax]]. After his meeting, he gets into a cab only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Michael 'Mickey' Pearson\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Raymond Smith\n* [[Henry Golding]] as Dry Eye\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Rosalind Pearson\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Matthew Berger\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Coach\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Fletcher\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Big Dave\n* Chidi Ajufo as Bunny\n* [[Jason Wong]] as Phuc\n* Brittany Ashworth as Ruby\n* [[Samuel West]] as Lord Pressfield\n* [[Eliot Sumner]] as Laura Pressfield\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as Jackie\n* [[Chris Evangelou]] as Primetime\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Benny\n* [[Bugzy Malone]] as Ernie\n* [[Tom Wu]] as Lord George\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in May 2018 that [[Guy Ritchie]] would write and direct ''The Gentlemen'', a film that would be in the same spirit as his earlier ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]''.
