The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend. The one most closely associated with his life is that [[Deal with the Devil|he sold his soul to the devil]] at a [[crossroads (mythology)|local crossroads]] to achieve musical success. He is now recognized as a master of the blacks, particularly the [[Delta blacks]] style.\n\nAs an [[wikt:Special:Search/itinerant|itinerant]] performer who played mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He participated in only two recording sessions, one in [[San Antonio]] in 1936, and one in [[Dallas]] in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs (with 13 surviving alternate takes) recorded by famed Country Music Hall of Fame producer [[Don Law]]. These songs, recorded at low fidelity in improvised studios, were the totality of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch, [[78 rpm]] [[Single (music)|singles]] from {{nowrap|1937\u20131938}}, with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings, very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the [[Mississippi Delta]] where he spent most of his life; much of his story has been reconstructed after his death by researchers.\n\nHis music had a small, but influential, following during his life and in the two decades after his death. In late 1938 [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]] sought him out for a concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'', only to discover that Johnson had died. [[Brunswick Records]], which owned the original recordings, was bought by [[Columbia Records]], where Hammond was employed. [[Musicologist]] [[Alan Lomax]] went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. Law, who by then worked for Columbia Records, assembled a collection of Johnson's recordings titled ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnson's  work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially on the nascent [[British blues]] movement; [[Eric Clapton]] has called Johnson \"the most important blues singer that ever lived.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 50 Albums That Changed Music |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/popandrock.shopping |journal=The Observer |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 1, 2008  |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>LaVere, Stephen (1990).

Many of Johnson's songs have been covered over the years, becoming hits for other artists, and his [[guitar lick]]s and lyrics have been borrowed by many later musicians.\n\nRenewed interest in Johnson's work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what is known about him was reconstructed by researchers such as [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]]. Two films, the 1991 documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' by [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond, Jr.]], and a 1997 documentary, ''Can't You Hear the Wind Howl, the Life and Music of Robert Johnson,''  which included reconstructed scenes with [[Keb' Mo']] as Johnson, were attempts to document his life, and demonstrated the difficulties arising from the scant historical record and conflicting oral accounts.\n\nJohnson was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early influence on rock and roll.<ref name=\"rockandroll_halloffame\">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/robert-johnson \"Robert Johnson Inducted at the 1986 Induction Ceremony\"].

Julia was married to Charles Dodds (born February 1865), a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker, with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a [[Lynching in the United States|lynch]] mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert, but after two years sent the boy to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to live with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer.<ref>Guralnik, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nRobert rejoined his mother around 1919 in the [[Mississippi Delta]] area, near [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] and [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi|Robinsonville]]. They lived on the Abbay & Leatherman Plantation.<ref>[http://www.msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/abbay-leatherman Mississippi Blues Trail]. Retrieved September 25, 2018.</ref> Julia's new husband, known as Dusty Willis, was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as \"Little Robert Dusty\",<ref>Guralnik, p. 11.</ref> but he was registered at Tunica's Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census, he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in [[Lucas, Arkansas]], with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927.<ref name=\"Freeland 2000\"/> The quality of his signature on his marriage certificate<ref>Wardlow 1998, p. 201.</ref> suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background. A school friend, Willie Coffee, who was interviewed and filmed in later life, recalled that as a youth Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref>Mugge, Robert (2000). ''Hellhounds on My Trail: The Afterlife of Robert Johnson''. Quoted in Wald 2004, p. 107.</ref> Coffee recalled that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis.<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 6.</ref>\n\nAfter school, Robert adopted the surname of his natural father, signing himself as Robert Johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 108.</ref> Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] that this was a divine punishment for Robert's decision to sing secular songs, known as \"selling your soul to the Devil\". McCormick believed that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Search for Robert Johnson'', 1992 film.</ref>\n\nAround this time, the blues musician [[Son House]] moved to Robinsonville, where his musical partner [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]] lived. Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a \"little boy\" who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace, possibly searching for his natural father. Here he perfected the guitar style of House and learned other styles from [[Ike Zimmerman|Isaiah \"Ike\" Zimmerman]].<ref name=\"Pearson & McCulloch p. 7\">Pearson and McCulloch, p. 7.</ref> Zimmerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight.<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 94.</ref>\nWhen Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique.<ref>Guralnick, p. 15.</ref> House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson's pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnson's technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.<ref name=\"Wardlow\" />\n\nWhile living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple moved to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], in the Delta. Caletta died in childbirth, and Johnson left for a career as a \"walking\" or itinerant musician.<ref name=\"Pearson & McCulloch p. 7\"/>\n\n===Itinerant musician===\nFrom 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between the cities of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas.<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 12.</ref><ref>Gioia, p. 172.</ref> On occasion, he traveled much further. The blues musician [[Johnny Shines]] accompanied him to Chicago, Texas, New York, Canada, Kentucky, and Indiana.<ref>Neff and Connor, p. 56.</ref> [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]] shared a musical engagement with him in St. Louis.<ref>Townsend, p. 68.</ref> In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends.<ref>Guralnik, p. 28.</ref> He did not marry again but formed some long-term relationships with women to whom he would return periodically. In other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance.<ref>Guralnik, p. 24.</ref><ref>Gioia, p. 175.</ref> In each location, Johnson's hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames.<ref>Gioia, pp. 172\u2013173.</ref>\n\nBiographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], who knew him as his mother's partner; [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]], whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson.<ref>Edwards, p. 100.</ref> From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts,<ref>Schroeder, p. 22.</ref> biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. \"He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable\".<ref>Guralnik, p. 29.</ref> \"As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way\".<ref>Wald, p. 112.</ref> \"Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average\u2014except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road.\"<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 111.</ref>\n\nWhen Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D7113CF93BA15751C0A9629C8B63 | work=New York Times | title=Revisionists Sing New Blues History | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=February 28, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.\n\nShines was 17 when he met Johnson in 1933. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself. Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charters's ''Robert Johnson'':\n\n{{quote|Robert was a very friendly person, even though he was sulky at times, you know. And I hung around Robert for quite a while. One evening he disappeared. He was kind of a peculiar fellow. Robert'd be standing up playing some place, playing like nobody's business. At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure. And money'd be coming from all directions. But Robert'd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing. And you wouldn't see Robert no more maybe in two or three weeks.&nbsp;... So Robert and I, we began journeying off. I was just, matter of fact, tagging along.<ref>Charters</ref>}}\n\nDuring this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases, he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.\n\nIn 1941, [[Alan Lomax]] learned from [[Muddy Waters]] that Johnson had performed in the area around [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]].<ref>Lomax 1993</ref> By 1959, the historian [[Samuel Charters]] could add only that [[Will Shade]], of the [[Memphis Jug Band]], remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].<ref>Charters 1959</ref> In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to St. Louis and possibly Illinois and then to some states in the East. In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] producer [[John H. Hammond]], who owned some of Johnson's records, directed the record producer [[Don Law]] seek out Johnson to book him for the first \"[[From Spirituals to Swing]]\" concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. On learning of Johnson's death, Hammond replaced him with [[Big Bill Broonzy]], but he played two of Johnson's records from the stage.\n\n===Recording sessions===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header = \n| width = 150\n| image1 = Milkcow'sCalfBlues.jpg\n| image2 = LoveInVainBlues.jpg\n| image3 = IBelieveI'llDustMyBroom.jpg\n| caption3 = Johnson's recordings were released by several record companies: \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" by Perfect, \"Love in Vain Blues\" by [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], and \"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\" by Conqueror.\n}}\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, around 1936, Johnson sought out [[H. C. Speir]], who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to [[Don Law]] to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas. The recording session was held on November 23\u201325, 1936, in room 414 of the [[Gunter Hotel]] in San Antonio,<ref>\"Blues Wizard's S.A. Legacy\". ''San Antonio Express-News''. November 30, 1986. p. 1-J.</ref> which Brunswick Records had set up to be a temporary recording studio. In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played 16 selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them. He reportedly performed facing the wall, which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer. This conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the 1961 album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''. The [[slide guitarist]] [[Ry Cooder]] speculates that Johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar, a technique he calls \"corner loading\".<ref>Ry Cooder quoted in Guitar Player magazine, September 1990, p69, in article \"The Real Robert Johnson\" by Jas Obrecht</ref>\n\nAmong the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were \"[[Come On in My Kitchen]]\", \"[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues]]\", \"[[Dust My Broom|I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]\" and \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\". The first to be released were \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\" and \"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\", probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear. \"Terraplane Blues\" became a modest regional hit, selling 5,000 copies.\n\nHis first recorded song, \"Kind Hearted Woman Blues\", was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with [[Leroy Carr]]'s \"Mean Mistreater Mama\" (1934). According to [[Elijah Wald]], it was \"the most musically complex in the cycle\"<ref name=Wald-131>Wald 2004, p. 131.</ref> and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric, rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses.<ref>Wald 2004, pp. 132\u2013 176.</ref> In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78-rpm side.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 132.</ref> Most of Johnson's \"somber and introspective\" songs and performances come from his second recording session.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 167.</ref>\n\nJohnson traveled to [[Dallas]], Texas, for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the [[Vitagraph]] (Warner Brothers) Building, at 508 Park Avenue,<ref>{{cite news| author=Chistensen, Thor| date=November 19, 2011| title=Dallas Church Preserving the Legacy of Robert Johnson| newspaper=New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/us/dallas-church-preserving-the-legacy-of-robert-johnson.html?_r=0}}</ref> on June 19\u201320, 1937 where Brunswick Record Corporation was located on the third floor.<ref>''Eric Clapton&nbsp;\u2013 Sessions for Robert Johnson''. Documentary, 2004. ''Worley's Dallas City Directory'', 1937.</ref> Eleven records from this session would be released within the following year. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs, and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 130.</ref> Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography in Dallas.\n\n===Death===\nJohnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], of unknown causes. His death was not reported publicly; he merely disappeared from the historical record and it was not until almost 30 years later, when [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]], a Mississippi-based [[musicologist]] researching Johnson's life, found his death certificate, which listed only the date and location, with no official cause of death. No formal autopsy was done, as a dead black man found by the side of the road near a farm, a [[pro forma]] examination was done to file the death certificate, and no immediate cause of death was determined. It is likely he had [[congenital syphilis]] and it was suspected later by medical professionals that may have been a contributing factor in his death. However, 30 years of local legend and oral tradition had, like the rest of his life story, built a legend which has filled in gaps in the scant historical record.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Havers |first1=Richard |title=The Devil's Music: The Life And Legacy Of Robert Johnson |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/devils-music-myth-robert-johnson/ |website=uDiscover Music |accessdate=2 April 2019 |date=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeveral differing accounts have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, and she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, \"Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand.\" Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but he declined to reveal the man's name.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile [[strychnine]] has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves, in his book ''Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson'', relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days.<ref>{{cite book|title=Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson|first=Tom |last=Graves|first2= Steve |last2=LaVere|publisher=Demers Books|year=2008 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crossroadslifeaf0000grav/page/39 39\u201343] |url=https://archive.org/details/crossroadslifeaf0000grav|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-9816002-0-8 |quote=The tale most often told about how Johnson met his fate is that he was poisoned by a jealous husband who put strychnine in his whiskey.}}</ref><!-- for whole para so far--> \n\nThe LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, years later and after conducting an investigation into Johnson's death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote a clarifying note on the back of Johnson's death certificate:\n\n{{quote|I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place.

He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him.

A one-ton [[cenotaph]] in the shape of an obelisk, listing all of Johnson's song titles, with a central inscription by [[Peter Guralnick]], was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]].\n* In 1990, a small marker with the epitaph \"Resting in the Blues\" was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel, near Quito, Mississippi, by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in ''Living Blues'' magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnson's ex-girlfriends to be Johnson's burial site.<ref>Cheseborough, Steve (2008).

Through LaVere, Sony Music placed a marker at this site, which bears LaVere's name as well as Johnson's.\n\nJohn Hammond, Jr., in the documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' (1991), suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a pauper's grave (or \"[[potter's field]]\") very near where he died.\n\n==Devil legend==\nAccording to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician. He was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near [[Dockery Plantation]] at midnight. There he was met by a large black man (the Devil) who took the guitar and tuned it. The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument. This story of a deal with the Devil at the crossroads mirrors the legend of [[Faust]]. In exchange for his soul, Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.\n\n===Various accounts===\nThis legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]],<ref>Wardlow, pp. 196\u2013201.</ref> Edward Komara<ref>Wardlow, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death.<ref>Wald, pp. 265\u2013276.</ref> [[Son House]] once told the story to [[Pete Welding]] as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in ''[[Down Beat]]'' in 1966.<ref>Whelan</ref> Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.\n\nFurther details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by [[Greil Marcus]]<ref>Marcus 1975.</ref> and [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]].<ref>Palmer 1981.</ref> Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography ''Crossroads'', by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]]. This story was collected from his musical associate [[Ishman Bracey]] and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s.<ref>Wardlow 1998.</ref> One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]]'s 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson,<ref>Evans 1971.</ref> and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside House's story in the widely read ''Searching for Robert Johnson'', by Peter Guralnick.<ref>Guralnik 1982.</ref>\n\nIn another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zimmerman of [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]], learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Johnson.<ref>Wardlow 1998, p. 197.</ref> [[File:ClarksdaleMS Crossroads.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary crossroads at Clarksdale, Mississippi]] Recent research by the blues scholar [[Bruce Conforth]], in ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed: Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby [[Beauregard, Mississippi|Beauregard]], and he did not practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area.<ref>''Living Blues'' 39:1 (issue 194), February 2008. pp. 68\u201373.</ref> Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.\n\nWhile Dockery, Hazlehurst and Beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads, there are also tourist attractions claiming to be \"The Crossroads\" in both Clarksdale and Memphis.<ref>Wardlow 1998, p. 200.</ref> Residents of [[Rosedale, Mississippi]], claim Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of Highways 1 and 8 in their town, while the 1986 movie ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'' was filmed in [[Beulah, Mississippi]]. The blues historian Steve Cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads, because \"Robert Johnson was a rambling guy\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Cheseborough | first = Steve | title = Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | edition = 3rd | year = 2008 | page = 83 | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Interpretations===\nSee generally [[Crossroads (mythology)#blues songs|\"Crossroads\" main article, \"blues songs\" section]].\n\nSome scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the Christian figure of Satan but also to the African trickster god [[Papa Legba|Legba]], himself associated with crossroads. Folklorist Harry M. Hyatt wrote that, during his research in the South from 1935 to 1939, when African-Americans born in the 19th or early 20th century said they or anyone else had \"sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads,\" they had a different meaning in mind. Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a \"deal\" (not selling the soul in the same sense as in the Faustian tradition cited by Graves) with the so-called devil at the crossroads.<ref>Hyatt, Harry (1973).

Western Publications.</ref>\n\n{{quote|The Blues and the Blues singer has really special powers over women, especially. It is said that the Blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted. And so when Robert Johnson came back, having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician, with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics, people said he must have sold his soul to the devil. And that fits in with this old African association with the crossroads where you find wisdom: you go down to the crossroads to learn, and in his case to learn in a Faustian pact, with the devil. You sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history.<ref name=\"Ferris\">Ferris, Bill. ''[[The Story with Dick Gordon]]''. [[American Public Media]].</ref>}}\n\nThis view that the devil in Johnson's songs is derived from an African deity was disputed by the blues scholar [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]] in an essay published in 1999, \"Demythologizing the Blues\":\n\n{{quote|There are&nbsp;... several serious problems with this crossroads myth. The devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore, and nowhere do blues singers ever mention Legba or any other African deity in their songs or other lore. The actual African music connected with cults of Legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues, but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral call-and-response singing.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Demythologizing the Blues| author = Evans, David| date = October 22, 1999| journal = Institute for Studies in American Music Newsletter}}</ref>}}\n\nThe musicologist [[Alan Lomax]] dismissed the myth, stating, \"In fact, every blues fiddler, banjo picker, harp blower, piano strummer and guitar framer was, in the opinion of both himself and his peers, a child of the Devil, a consequence of the black view of the European dance embrace as sinful in the extreme\".<ref>Lomax, p. 365.</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\nJohnson is considered a master of the blues, particularly of the Delta blues style. [[Keith Richards]], of the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], said in 1990, \"You want to know how good the blues can get?

These subtle inflections of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. [[Eric Clapton]] described Johnson's music as \"the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice\". In two takes of \"Me and the Devil Blues\" he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: \"The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing.\"<ref>Wald 2004, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> The song's \"hip humor and sophistication\" is often overlooked. \"[G]enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism\", wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.<ref name=Wald-177/>\n\nJohnson is also known for using the guitar as \"the other vocalist in the song\", a technique later perfected by [[B. B. King]] and his personified guitar named [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]]: \"In Africa and in Afro-American tradition, there is the tradition of the talking instrument, beginning with the drums&nbsp;... the one-strand and then the six-strings with bottleneck-style performance; it becomes a competing voice&nbsp;... or a complementary voice&nbsp;... in the performance.\"<ref name=\"Ferris\"/>\n{{Quote_box\n|width=20%\n|align=right\n|quote=When Johnson started singing, he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of Zeus in full armor.

Biographer [[Elijah Wald]] and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds, including that Johnson's extant recordings were made on five different days, spread across two years at two different studios, making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable.<ref name=\"Wald\">{{cite web | title=The Robert Johnson Recording Speed Controversy | author=Wald, Elijah | url=http://www.elijahwald.com/johnsonspeed.html | accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> In addition, fellow musicians, contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed Johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than 70 years preceding Wilde's hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered.<ref name=\"Wald\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nJohnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on \"Rambling on My Mind\" is pure Delta and Johnson's vocal there has \"a touch of&nbsp;... Son House rawness\", but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues\u2014it is more like something out of [[minstrel show]] music or [[vaudeville]].<ref>Wald 2004, p. 139.</ref> Johnson did record versions of \"Preaching the Blues\" and \"Walking Blues\" in the older bluesman's vocal and guitar style (House's chronology has been questioned by Guralnick). As with the first take of \"Come On in My Kitchen\", the influence of Skip James is evident in James's \"Devil Got My Woman\", but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output.<ref>Wald 2004, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe sad, romantic \"Love in Vain\" successfully blends several of Johnson's disparate influences. The form, including the wordless last verse, follows Leroy Carr's last hit \"When the Sun Goes Down\"; the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] recorded in 1926.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 183.</ref>  Johnson's last recording, \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" is his most direct tribute to [[Kokomo Arnold]], who wrote \"Milkcow Blues\" and influenced Johnson's vocal style.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 184.</ref>\n\n\"[[From Four Until Late]]\" shows Johnson's mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He [[crooner|croons]] the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], and his guitar style is more that of a [[ragtime]]-influenced player like [[Blind Blake]].<ref name=Wald-170-171>Wald 2004, pp. 170\u2013171, 174.</ref> Lonnie Johnson's influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style: \"Malted Milk\" and \"Drunken Hearted Man\". Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnson's \"Life Saver Blues\".<ref>Wald 2004, p. 175.</ref>  The two takes of \"Me and the Devil Blues\" show the influence of [[Peetie Wheatstraw]], calling into question the interpretation of this piece as \"the spontaneous heart-cry of a demon-driven folk artist\".<ref name=Wald-177>Wald 2004, p. 177.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\nJohnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians, but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous. His influence on contemporaries was much smaller, in part because he was an itinerant performer\u2014playing mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances\u2014who worked in a then undervalued style of music. He also died young after recording only a handful of songs. Johnson, though well-traveled and admired in his performances, was little noted in his lifetime, and his records were even less appreciated. \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\", sometimes described as Johnson's only hit record, outsold his others, but was still only a minor success.\n\nIf one had asked black blues fans about Johnson in the first 20 years after his death, writes [[Elijah Wald]], \"the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled 'Robert who?'\" This lack of recognition extended to black musicians: \"As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note\".<ref>Wald 2004.</ref> [[Columbia Records]] released the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'', a compilation of Johnson's recordings, in 1961, which introduced his work to a much wider audience\u2014fame and recognition he received only long after his death.\n\nJohnson was honored with two markers on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], one at his birthplace in Hazlehurst and another at his presumed gravesite in Greenwood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/robert-johnson-birthplace|title=Robert Johnson Birthplace|last=|first=|date=|website=Mississippi Blues Trail|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/robert-johnson-gravesite|title=Robert Johnson Gravesite|last=|first=|date=|website=Mississippi Blues Trail|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Rock and roll===\nJohnson's greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death: [[rock and roll]] and rock.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, almost a half century after his death. Marc Meyers, of the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'', wrote that \"His 'Stop Breakin' Down Blues' from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954.\"<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\n===Rock music and related genres===\nMany of the artists who claim to have been influenced by Johnson the most, injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections, are prominent rock musicians from the United Kingdom. His impact on these musicians\u2014who contributed to and helped to define [[rock and roll]] and rock music\u2014came from the compilation of his works released in 1961 by Columbia Records (''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'').\n\n[[Brian Jones]], of [[the Rolling Stones]], introduced his bandmate Keith Richards to this album by Johnson. The blues master's recordings would have as much impact on him as on [[Mick Jagger]]. The group performed his \"[[Walkin' Blues]]\" at the [[Rock and Roll Circus]] in 1968. They arranged their own version of \"[[Love in Vain]]\" for their album ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' and recorded \"[[Stop Breakin' Down Blues]]\" for ''[[Exile on Main Street]]''. Jagger, in the role of Turner in the 1970 film ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'', performed excerpts from \"[[Come On in My Kitchen]]\" and \"[[Me and the Devil Blues]]\".\n\n[[Alexis Korner]], who has been called \"the Founding Father of British Blues\", co-wrote and recorded a song entitled \"Robert Johnson\" for ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner)|The Party Album]]'', released in 1978. Other examples of the influence he had on English blues and [[Blues rock|blues-rock]] musicians and musical groups include the following:\n* [[Eric Clapton]] considers Johnson \"the most important blues musician who ever lived\".<ref name=\"Buncombe\"/> He recorded enough of his songs to make ''[[Me and Mr. Johnson]]'', a blues-rock album released in 2004 as a tribute to the legendary bluesman (it was also used in the film ''Sessions for Robert J'').

Two marriage licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates, as do the entries showing his attendance at Indian Creek School, in Tunica, Mississippi. That he was not listed among his mother's children in the [[1910 United States Census|1910 census]]<ref name=\"Freeland 2000\">Freeland 2000.</ref> casts further doubt on these dates. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Robert's mother, remembered his birth date as May&nbsp;8, 1911. The [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]] gives his age as 7, suggesting he was born in 1912 or 1913.<ref name=\"rewald\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tdblues.com/2009/10/new-robert-johnson-census-records/|title=New Robert Johnson Census Records|last=Rewald|first=Jason|date=October 9, 2009|work=tdblues.com|accessdate=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713033235/http://www.tdblues.com/2009/10/new-robert-johnson-census-records/|archive-date=July 13, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Five significant dates from his career are documented: Monday, Thursday and Friday, November 23, 26, and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio, Texas; and Saturday and Sunday, June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas. His death certificate, discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his death.<ref>Wardlow and Komara 1998, p. 87.</ref>\n\nJohnson's records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release, and efforts were made to discover his biography, with virtually no success. The blues researcher [[Mack McCormick]] began researching his family background in 1972, but died in 2015 without ever publishing his findings. McCormick's research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted [[Peter Guralnick]] to publish a summary in ''Living Blues'' (1982), later reprinted in book form as ''Searching for Robert Johnson''.<ref>Guralnick</ref> Later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details. A revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by Stephen LaVere for the booklet accompanying the [[compilation album]] ''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|Robert Johnson, The Complete Recordings]]'' (1990), and is maintained with updates at the Delta Haze website.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.deltahaze.com/johnson/bio.html |title=Robert Johnson&nbsp;\u2013 Bio\n|publisher=www.deltahaze.com |accessdate=July 15, 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714234938/http://www.deltahaze.com/johnson/bio.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 14, 2008}}</ref> The documentary film ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' contains accounts by McCormick and Wardlow of what informants have told them: long interviews of [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]] and Johnny Shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family. Another film, ''Can't You Hear the Wind Howl: The Life and Music of Robert Johnson,''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertjohnsonfilm.com/robertjohnsonfilm.com/Welcome.html|title=The Life & Music of Robert Johnson|accessdate=2019-08-06}}</ref> combines documentary segments with recreated scenes featuring [[Keb' Mo']] as Johnson with narration by Danny Glover. Shines, Edwards and Robert Lockwood contribute interviews. These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives, partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts.\n\nA relatively full account of Johnson's brief musical career emerged in the 1960s, largely from accounts by Son House, Johnny Shines, David Honeyboy Edwards and Robert Lockwood. In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' included reminiscences of [[Don Law]] who had recorded Johnson in 1936. Law added to the mystique surrounding Johnson, representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy.\n\n===Photographs===\nThe two confirmed images of Johnson were located in 1973, in the possession of his half-sister Carrie Thompson, but were not widely published until the late 1980s. A third photo, purporting to show Johnson posing with the blues musician [[Johnny Shines]], was published in the November 2008 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine.<ref>Digiacomo, Frank (2008). \"Searching for Robert Johnson\".

This photograph has never been made public.\n\n===Descendants===\nJohnson left no [[Will and testament|will]]. In 1998, the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] ruled that Claud Johnson, a retired truck driver living in [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi]], was the son of Robert Johnson and his only heir. The court heard that he had been born to Virgie Jane Smith (later Virgie Jane Cain), who had a relationship with Robert Johnson in 1931. The relationship was attested to by a friend, Eula Mae Williams, but other relatives descended from Robert Johnson's half-sister, Carrie Harris Thompson, contested Claud Johnson's claim. The effect of the judgment was to allow Claud Johnson to receive over $1 million in royalties.<ref>{{cite news | title=Court Rules Father of the Blues Has a Son | newspaper=New York Times | author=Bragg, Rick | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/17/us/court-rules-father-of-the-blues-has-a-son.html | accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> Claud Johnson died, aged 83, on June 30, 2015, leaving six children.<ref>{{cite news | title=Claud Johnson, Son of Blues Singer, Dies at 83 | newspaper=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/arts/music/claud-johnson-83-son-of-blues-singer.html?_r=0 | accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other Robert Johnsons ===\nThe ''[[Radiolab]]'' podcast \"Crossroads\", broadcast initially April 16, 2012, on [[VPR|NPR]], raises the possibility that more than one Robert Johnson was traveling around the region making music at the time of the subject's life \u2014 perhaps confusing related biographical information. Producers of the show spoke with Tom Graves, Elijah Wald, David Evans, and [[Mack McCormick|Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] to support this theory. The death certificate attributed to Johnson, for example, indicates on the reverse side that (possibly another) Robert Johnson came to the area to play banjo (not guitar) and died of [[syphilis]]. This could help explain some of the confusion surrounding Johnson's cause of death.\n\nJohnson was also reportedly seen twice after his supposed death, once in 1939 and another time in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/199705-crossroads/|title=Crossroads|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Robert Johnson discography}}\n{{listen\n| filename = Traveling Riverside Blues sample.ogg\n| title = Traveling Riverside Blues\n| format  = [[ogg]]\n| filename2 = Crossroads.ogg\n| title2 = Cross Road Blues\n| format2 [[ogg]]\n}}\nEleven 78-rpm records by Johnson were released by [[Vocalion Records]] during his lifetime.

His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend. The one most closely associated with his life is that [[Deal with the Devil|he sold his soul to the devil]] at a [[crossroads (mythology)|local crossroads]] to achieve musical success. He is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly the [[Delta blues]] style.\n\nAs an [[wikt:Special:Search/itinerant|itinerant]] performer who played mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He participated in only two recording sessions, one in [[San Antonio]] in 1936, and one in [[Dallas]] in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs (with 13 surviving alternate takes) recorded by famed Country Music Hall of Fame producer [[Don Law]]. These songs, recorded at low fidelity in improvised studios, were the totality of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch, [[78 rpm]] [[Single (music)|singles]] from {{nowrap|1937\u20131938}}, with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings, very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the [[Mississippi Delta]] where he spent most of his life; much of his story has been reconstructed after his death by researchers.\n\nHis music had a small, but influential, following during his life and in the two decades after his death. In late 1938 [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]] sought him out for a concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'', only to discover that Johnson had died. [[Brunswick Records]], which owned the original recordings, was bought by [[Columbia Records]], where Hammond was employed. [[Musicologist]] [[Alan Lomax]] went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. Law, who by then worked for Columbia Records, assembled a collection of Johnson's recordings titled ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnson's  work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially on the nascent [[British blues]] movement; [[Eric Clapton]] has called Johnson \"the most important blues singer that ever lived.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 50 Albums That Changed Music |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/popandrock.shopping |journal=The Observer |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 1, 2008  |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>LaVere, Stephen (1990).

Many of Johnson's songs have been covered over the years, becoming hits for other artists, and his [[guitar lick]]s and lyrics have been borrowed by many later musicians.\n\nRenewed interest in Johnson's work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what is known about him was reconstructed by researchers such as [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]]. Two films, the 1991 documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' by [[John P.

Julia was married to Charles Dodds (born February 1865), a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker, with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a [[Lynching in the United States|lynch]] mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert, but after two years sent the boy to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to live with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer.<ref>Guralnik, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nRobert rejoined his mother around 1919 in the [[Mississippi Delta]] area, near [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] and [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi|Robinsonville]]. They lived on the Abbay & Leatherman Plantation.<ref>[http://www.msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/abbay-leatherman Mississippi Blues Trail]. Retrieved September 25, 2018.</ref> Julia's new husband, known as Dusty Willis, was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as \"Little Robert Dusty\",<ref>Guralnik, p. 11.</ref> but he was registered at Tunica's Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census, he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in [[Lucas, Arkansas]], with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927.<ref name=\"Freeland 2000\"/> The quality of his signature on his marriage certificate<ref>Wardlow 1998, p. 201.</ref> suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background. A school friend, Willie Coffee, who was interviewed and filmed in later life, recalled that as a youth Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref>Mugge, Robert (2000). ''Hellhounds on My Trail: The Afterlife of Robert Johnson''. Quoted in Wald 2004, p. 107.</ref> Coffee recalled that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis.<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 6.</ref>\n\nAfter school, Robert adopted the surname of his natural father, signing himself as Robert Johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 108.</ref> Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] that this was a divine punishment for Robert's decision to sing secular songs, known as \"selling your soul to the Devil\". McCormick believed that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Search for Robert Johnson'', 1992 film.</ref>\n\nAround this time, the blues musician [[Son House]] moved to Robinsonville, where his musical partner [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]] lived. Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a \"little boy\" who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace, possibly searching for his natural father. Here he perfected the guitar style of House and learned other styles from [[Ike Zimmerman|Isaiah \"Ike\" Zimmerman]].<ref name=\"Pearson & McCulloch p. 7\">Pearson and McCulloch, p. 7.</ref> Zimmerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight.<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 94.</ref>\nWhen Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique.<ref>Guralnick, p. 15.</ref> House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson's pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnson's technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.<ref name=\"Wardlow\" />\n\nWhile living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple moved to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], in the Delta. Caletta died in childbirth, and Johnson left for a career as a \"walking\" or itinerant musician.<ref name=\"Pearson & McCulloch p. 7\"/>\n\n===Itinerant musician===\nFrom 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between the cities of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas.<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 12.</ref><ref>Gioia, p. 172.</ref> On occasion, he traveled much further. The blues musician [[Johnny Shines]] accompanied him to Chicago, Texas, New York, Canada, Kentucky, and Indiana.<ref>Neff and Connor, p. 56.</ref> [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]] shared a musical engagement with him in St. Louis.<ref>Townsend, p. 68.</ref> In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends.<ref>Guralnik, p. 28.</ref> He did not marry again but formed some long-term relationships with women to whom he would return periodically. In other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance.<ref>Guralnik, p. 24.</ref><ref>Gioia, p. 175.</ref> In each location, Johnson's hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames.<ref>Gioia, pp. 172\u2013173.</ref>\n\nBiographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], who knew him as his mother's partner; [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]], whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson.<ref>Edwards, p. 100.</ref> From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts,<ref>Schroeder, p. 22.</ref> biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. \"He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable\".<ref>Guralnik, p. 29.</ref> \"As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way\".<ref>Wald, p. 112.</ref> \"Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average\u2014except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road.\"<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 111.</ref>\n\nWhen Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D7113CF93BA15751C0A9629C8B63 | work=New York Times | title=Revisionists Sing New Blues History | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=February 28, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.\n\nShines was 17 when he met Johnson in 1933. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself. Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charters's ''Robert Johnson'':\n\n{{quote|Robert was a very friendly person, even though he was sulky at times, you know. And I hung around Robert for quite a while. One evening he disappeared. He was kind of a peculiar fellow. Robert'd be standing up playing some place, playing like nobody's business. At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure. And money'd be coming from all directions. But Robert'd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing. And you wouldn't see Robert no more maybe in two or three weeks.&nbsp;... So Robert and I, we began journeying off. I was just, matter of fact, tagging along.<ref>Charters</ref>}}\n\nDuring this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases, he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.\n\nIn 1941, [[Alan Lomax]] learned from [[Muddy Waters]] that Johnson had performed in the area around [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]].<ref>Lomax 1993</ref> By 1959, the historian [[Samuel Charters]] could add only that [[Will Shade]], of the [[Memphis Jug Band]], remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].<ref>Charters 1959</ref> In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to St. Louis and possibly Illinois and then to some states in the East. In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] producer [[John H. Hammond]], who owned some of Johnson's records, directed the record producer [[Don Law]] seek out Johnson to book him for the first \"[[From Spirituals to Swing]]\" concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. On learning of Johnson's death, Hammond replaced him with [[Big Bill Broonzy]], but he played two of Johnson's records from the stage.\n\n===Recording sessions===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header = \n| width = 150\n| image1 = Milkcow'sCalfBlues.jpg\n| image2 = LoveInVainBlues.jpg\n| image3 = IBelieveI'llDustMyBroom.jpg\n| caption3 = Johnson's recordings were released by several record companies: \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" by Perfect, \"Love in Vain Blues\" by [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], and \"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\" by Conqueror.\n}}\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, around 1936, Johnson sought out [[H. C. Speir]], who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to [[Don Law]] to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas. The recording session was held on November 23\u201325, 1936, in room 414 of the [[Gunter Hotel]] in San Antonio,<ref>\"Blues Wizard's S.A. Legacy\". ''San Antonio Express-News''. November 30, 1986. p. 1-J.</ref> which Brunswick Records had set up to be a temporary recording studio. In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played 16 selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them. He reportedly performed facing the wall, which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer. This conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the 1961 album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''. The [[slide guitarist]] [[Ry Cooder]] speculates that Johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar, a technique he calls \"corner loading\".<ref>Ry Cooder quoted in Guitar Player magazine, September 1990, p69, in article \"The Real Robert Johnson\" by Jas Obrecht</ref>\n\nAmong the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were \"[[Come On in My Kitchen]]\", \"[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues]]\", \"[[Dust My Broom|I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]\" and \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\". The first to be released were \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\" and \"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\", probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear. \"Terraplane Blues\" became a modest regional hit, selling 5,000 copies.\n\nHis first recorded song, \"Kind Hearted Woman Blues\", was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with [[Leroy Carr]]'s \"Mean Mistreater Mama\" (1934). According to [[Elijah Wald]], it was \"the most musically complex in the cycle\"<ref name=Wald-131>Wald 2004, p. 131.</ref> and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric, rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses.<ref>Wald 2004, pp. 132\u2013 176.</ref> In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78-rpm side.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 132.</ref> Most of Johnson's \"somber and introspective\" songs and performances come from his second recording session.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 167.</ref>\n\nJohnson traveled to [[Dallas]], Texas, for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the [[Vitagraph]] (Warner Brothers) Building, at 508 Park Avenue,<ref>{{cite news| author=Chistensen, Thor| date=November 19, 2011| title=Dallas Church Preserving the Legacy of Robert Johnson| newspaper=New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/us/dallas-church-preserving-the-legacy-of-robert-johnson.html?_r=0}}</ref> on June 19\u201320, 1937 where Brunswick Record Corporation was located on the third floor.<ref>''Eric Clapton&nbsp;\u2013 Sessions for Robert Johnson''. Documentary, 2004. ''Worley's Dallas City Directory'', 1937.</ref> Eleven records from this session would be released within the following year. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs, and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 130.</ref> Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography in Dallas.\n\n===Death===\nJohnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], of unknown causes. His death was not reported publicly; he merely disappeared from the historical record and it was not until almost 30 years later, when [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]], a Mississippi-based [[musicologist]] researching Johnson's life, found his death certificate, which listed only the date and location, with no official cause of death. No formal autopsy was done, as a dead black man found by the side of the road near a farm, a [[pro forma]] examination was done to file the death certificate, and no immediate cause of death was determined. It is likely he had [[congenital syphilis]] and it was suspected later by medical professionals that may have been a contributing factor in his death. However, 30 years of local legend and oral tradition had, like the rest of his life story, built a legend which has filled in gaps in the scant historical record.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Havers |first1=Richard |title=The Devil's Music: The Life And Legacy Of Robert Johnson |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/devils-music-myth-robert-johnson/ |website=uDiscover Music |accessdate=2 April 2019 |date=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeveral differing accounts have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, and she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, \"Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand.\" Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but he declined to reveal the man's name.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile [[strychnine]] has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves, in his book ''Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson'', relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days.<ref>{{cite book|title=Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson|first=Tom |last=Graves|first2= Steve |last2=LaVere|publisher=Demers Books|year=2008 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crossroadslifeaf0000grav/page/39 39\u201343] |url=https://archive.org/details/crossroadslifeaf0000grav|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-9816002-0-8 |quote=The tale most often told about how Johnson met his fate is that he was poisoned by a jealous husband who put strychnine in his whiskey.}}</ref><!-- for whole para so far--> \n\nThe LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, years later and after conducting an investigation into Johnson's death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote a clarifying note on the back of Johnson's death certificate:\n\n{{quote|I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blues.jfrewald.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cert_back.jpg|format=JPG|title=Handwritten note on the back of Johnson's death certificate|publisher=Blues.Jfrewald.com|accessdate=2015-09-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144848/http://blues.jfrewald.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cert_back.jpg|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2006, a medical practitioner, David Connell, suggested, on the basis of photographs showing Johnson's \"unnaturally long fingers\" and \"one bad eye\", that Johnson may have had [[Marfan syndrome]], which could have both affected his guitar playing and contributed to his death due to [[aortic dissection]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1557967|year = 2006|last1 = Connell|first1 = D.|title = Retrospective blues: Robert Johnson\u2014an open letter to Eric Clapton|journal = British Medical Journal|volume = 333|issue = 7566|pages = 489|doi = 10.1136/bmj.333.7566.489}}</ref><ref>[https://grannysage.weebly.com/robert-johnson-and-the-legend-of-the-crossroads.html  Diane Wallace, \"Robert Johnson and the Legend of the Crossroads\", ''Grannysage''].

A one-ton [[cenotaph]] in the shape of an obelisk, listing all of Johnson's song titles, with a central inscription by [[Peter Guralnick]], was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]].\n* In 1990, a small marker with the epitaph \"Resting in the Blues\" was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel, near Quito, Mississippi, by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in ''Living Blues'' magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnson's ex-girlfriends to be Johnson's burial site.<ref>Cheseborough, Steve (2008). ''Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues''. University Press of Mississippi. pp. 145\u2013146. {{ISBN|1604733284}}.</ref>\n* More recent research by Stephen LaVere (including statements from Rosie Eskridge, the wife of the supposed gravedigger, in 2000)<ref>Pearson and McCulloch, p. 117.</ref> indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the Little Zion Church, north of Greenwood along Money Road. Through LaVere, Sony Music placed a marker at this site, which bears LaVere's name as well as Johnson's.\n\nJohn Hammond, Jr., in the documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' (1991), suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a pauper's grave (or \"[[potter's field]]\") very near where he died.\n\n==Devil legend==\nAccording to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician. He was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near [[Dockery Plantation]] at midnight. There he was met by a large black man (the Devil) who took the guitar and tuned it. The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument. This story of a deal with the Devil at the crossroads mirrors the legend of [[Faust]]. In exchange for his soul, Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.\n\n===Various accounts===\nThis legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]],<ref>Wardlow, pp. 196\u2013201.</ref> Edward Komara<ref>Wardlow, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death.<ref>Wald, pp. 265\u2013276.</ref> [[Son House]] once told the story to [[Pete Welding]] as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in ''[[Down Beat]]'' in 1966.<ref>Whelan</ref> Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.\n\nFurther details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by [[Greil Marcus]]<ref>Marcus 1975.</ref> and [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]].<ref>Palmer 1981.</ref> Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography ''Crossroads'', by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]]. This story was collected from his musical associate [[Ishman Bracey]] and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s.<ref>Wardlow 1998.</ref> One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]]'s 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson,<ref>Evans 1971.</ref> and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside House's story in the widely read ''Searching for Robert Johnson'', by Peter Guralnick.<ref>Guralnik 1982.</ref>\n\nIn another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zimmerman of [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]], learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Johnson.<ref>Wardlow 1998, p. 197.</ref> [[File:ClarksdaleMS Crossroads.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary crossroads at Clarksdale, Mississippi]] Recent research by the blues scholar [[Bruce Conforth]], in ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed: Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby [[Beauregard, Mississippi|Beauregard]], and he did not practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area.<ref>''Living Blues'' 39:1 (issue 194), February 2008. pp. 68\u201373.</ref> Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.\n\nWhile Dockery, Hazlehurst and Beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads, there are also tourist attractions claiming to be \"The Crossroads\" in both Clarksdale and Memphis.<ref>Wardlow 1998, p. 200.</ref> Residents of [[Rosedale, Mississippi]], claim Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of Highways 1 and 8 in their town, while the 1986 movie ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'' was filmed in [[Beulah, Mississippi]]. The blues historian Steve Cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads, because \"Robert Johnson was a rambling guy\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Cheseborough | first = Steve | title = Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | edition = 3rd | year = 2008 | page = 83 | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Interpretations===\nSee generally [[Crossroads (mythology)#blues songs|\"Crossroads\" main article, \"blues songs\" section]].\n\nSome scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the Christian figure of Satan but also to the African trickster god [[Papa Legba|Legba]], himself associated with crossroads. Folklorist Harry M. Hyatt wrote that, during his research in the South from 1935 to 1939, when African-Americans born in the 19th or early 20th century said they or anyone else had \"sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads,\" they had a different meaning in mind. Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a \"deal\" (not selling the soul in the same sense as in the Faustian tradition cited by Graves) with the so-called devil at the crossroads.<ref>Hyatt, Harry (1973).

And so when Robert Johnson came back, having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician, with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics, people said he must have sold his soul to the devil. And that fits in with this old African association with the crossroads where you find wisdom: you go down to the crossroads to learn, and in his case to learn in a Faustian pact, with the devil. You sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history.<ref name=\"Ferris\">Ferris, Bill. ''[[The Story with Dick Gordon]]''.

The devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore, and nowhere do blues singers ever mention Legba or any other African deity in their songs or other lore. The actual African music connected with cults of Legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues, but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral call-and-response singing.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Demythologizing the Blues| author = Evans, David| date = October 22, 1999| journal = Institute for Studies in American Music Newsletter}}</ref>}}\n\nThe musicologist [[Alan Lomax]] dismissed the myth, stating, \"In fact, every blues fiddler, banjo picker, harp blower, piano strummer and guitar framer was, in the opinion of both himself and his peers, a child of the Devil, a consequence of the black view of the European dance embrace as sinful in the extreme\".<ref>Lomax, p. 365.</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\nJohnson is considered a master of the blues, particularly of the Delta blues style. [[Keith Richards]], of the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], said in 1990, \"You want to know how good the blues can get?

These subtle inflections of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. [[Eric Clapton]] described Johnson's music as \"the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice\". In two takes of \"Me and the Devil Blues\" he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: \"The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing.\"<ref>Wald 2004, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> The song's \"hip humor and sophistication\" is often overlooked. \"[G]enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism\", wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.<ref name=Wald-177/>\n\nJohnson is also known for using the guitar as \"the other vocalist in the song\", a technique later perfected by [[B. B. King]] and his personified guitar named [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]]: \"In Africa and in Afro-American tradition, there is the tradition of the talking instrument, beginning with the drums&nbsp;... the one-strand and then the six-strings with bottleneck-style performance; it becomes a competing voice&nbsp;... or a complementary voice&nbsp;... in the performance.\"<ref name=\"Ferris\"/>\n{{Quote_box\n|width=20%\n|align=right\n|quote=When Johnson started singing, he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of Zeus in full armor.

His approach was complex and musically advanced. When [[Keith Richards]] was first introduced to Johnson's music by his bandmate [[Brian Jones]], he asked, \"Who is the other guy playing with him?\", not realizing it was Johnson playing one guitar. \"I was hearing two guitars, and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself\",<ref name=\"Buncombe\">{{cite journal| title=The Grandfather of Rock'n'Roll: The Devil's Instrument| last=Buncombe| first=Andrew| journal=[[The Independent]]| date=July 26, 2006| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-grandfather-of-rocknroll-the-devils-instrument-409317.html}}</ref> said Richards, who later stated that \"Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself\".<ref name=\"Myers\"/> \"As for his guitar technique, it's politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic\u2014moving effortlessly from hen-picking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chucka-chucka rhythm figures.\"<ref name=\"Myers\"/> \n\n===Lyrics===\nIn ''[[The Story with Dick Gordon]]'', Bill Ferris, of [[American Public Media]], said, \"Robert Johnson I think of in the same way I think of the British [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], who burned out early, who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry&nbsp;...

Every verse has sexuality associated with it.\"<ref name=\"Ferris\"/>\n\n===Playback speed hypothesis===\n\nIn ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s music blog from May 2010, Jon Wilde speculated without proof that Johnson's recordings may have been \"accidentally speeded up when first committed to 78 [rpm records], or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Robert Johnson Revelation Tells Us to Put the Brakes on the Blues | author=Wilde, Jon | work=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/may/27/robert-johnson-blues | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> He did not give a source for this statement. Biographer [[Elijah Wald]] and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds, including that Johnson's extant recordings were made on five different days, spread across two years at two different studios, making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable.<ref name=\"Wald\">{{cite web | title=The Robert Johnson Recording Speed Controversy | author=Wald, Elijah | url=http://www.elijahwald.com/johnsonspeed.html | accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> In addition, fellow musicians, contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed Johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than 70 years preceding Wilde's hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered.<ref name=\"Wald\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nJohnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on \"Rambling on My Mind\" is pure Delta and Johnson's vocal there has \"a touch of&nbsp;... Son House rawness\", but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues\u2014it is more like something out of [[minstrel show]] music or [[vaudeville]].<ref>Wald 2004, p. 139.</ref> Johnson did record versions of \"Preaching the Blues\" and \"Walking Blues\" in the older bluesman's vocal and guitar style (House's chronology has been questioned by Guralnick). As with the first take of \"Come On in My Kitchen\", the influence of Skip James is evident in James's \"Devil Got My Woman\", but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output.<ref>Wald 2004, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe sad, romantic \"Love in Vain\" successfully blends several of Johnson's disparate influences. The form, including the wordless last verse, follows Leroy Carr's last hit \"When the Sun Goes Down\"; the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] recorded in 1926.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 183.</ref>  Johnson's last recording, \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" is his most direct tribute to [[Kokomo Arnold]], who wrote \"Milkcow Blues\" and influenced Johnson's vocal style.<ref>Wald 2004, p. 184.</ref>\n\n\"[[From Four Until Late]]\" shows Johnson's mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He [[crooner|croons]] the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], and his guitar style is more that of a [[ragtime]]-influenced player like [[Blind Blake]].<ref name=Wald-170-171>Wald 2004, pp. 170\u2013171, 174.</ref> Lonnie Johnson's influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style: \"Malted Milk\" and \"Drunken Hearted Man\". Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnson's \"Life Saver Blues\".<ref>Wald 2004, p. 175.</ref>  The two takes of \"Me and the Devil Blues\" show the influence of [[Peetie Wheatstraw]], calling into question the interpretation of this piece as \"the spontaneous heart-cry of a demon-driven folk artist\".<ref name=Wald-177>Wald 2004, p. 177.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\nJohnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians, but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous. His influence on contemporaries was much smaller, in part because he was an itinerant performer\u2014playing mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances\u2014who worked in a then undervalued style of music. He also died young after recording only a handful of songs. Johnson, though well-traveled and admired in his performances, was little noted in his lifetime, and his records were even less appreciated. \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\", sometimes described as Johnson's only hit record, outsold his others, but was still only a minor success.\n\nIf one had asked black blues fans about Johnson in the first 20 years after his death, writes [[Elijah Wald]], \"the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled 'Robert who?'\" This lack of recognition extended to black musicians: \"As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note\".<ref>Wald 2004.</ref> [[Columbia Records]] released the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'', a compilation of Johnson's recordings, in 1961, which introduced his work to a much wider audience\u2014fame and recognition he received only long after his death.\n\nJohnson was honored with two markers on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], one at his birthplace in Hazlehurst and another at his presumed gravesite in Greenwood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/robert-johnson-birthplace|title=Robert Johnson Birthplace|last=|first=|date=|website=Mississippi Blues Trail|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/robert-johnson-gravesite|title=Robert Johnson Gravesite|last=|first=|date=|website=Mississippi Blues Trail|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Rock and roll===\nJohnson's greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death: [[rock and roll]] and rock.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, almost a half century after his death. Marc Meyers, of the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'', wrote that \"His 'Stop Breakin' Down Blues' from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954.\"<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\n===Rock music and related genres===\nMany of the artists who claim to have been influenced by Johnson the most, injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections, are prominent rock musicians from the United Kingdom. His impact on these musicians\u2014who contributed to and helped to define [[rock and roll]] and rock music\u2014came from the compilation of his works released in 1961 by Columbia Records (''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'').\n\n[[Brian Jones]], of [[the Rolling Stones]], introduced his bandmate Keith Richards to this album by Johnson. The blues master's recordings would have as much impact on him as on [[Mick Jagger]]. The group performed his \"[[Walkin' Blues]]\" at the [[Rock and Roll Circus]] in 1968. They arranged their own version of \"[[Love in Vain]]\" for their album ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' and recorded \"[[Stop Breakin' Down Blues]]\" for ''[[Exile on Main Street]]''. Jagger, in the role of Turner in the 1970 film ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'', performed excerpts from \"[[Come On in My Kitchen]]\" and \"[[Me and the Devil Blues]]\".\n\n[[Alexis Korner]], who has been called \"the Founding Father of British Blues\", co-wrote and recorded a song entitled \"Robert Johnson\" for ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner)|The Party Album]]'', released in 1978. Other examples of the influence he had on English blues and [[Blues rock|blues-rock]] musicians and musical groups include the following:\n* [[Eric Clapton]] considers Johnson \"the most important blues musician who ever lived\".<ref name=\"Buncombe\"/> He recorded enough of his songs to make ''[[Me and Mr. Johnson]]'', a blues-rock album released in 2004 as a tribute to the legendary bluesman (it was also used in the film ''Sessions for Robert J''). He earlier recorded \"Crossroads\", an arrangement of \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\", with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] in 1968, leading some to consider him \"the man largely responsible for making Robert Johnson a household name.\"<ref>\"[https://www.npr.org/local/stories/KPLU/149258634 Bo Diddley's 'Before You Accuse Me' Influential as the Master].

Guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] contributed two covers of Johnson-derived songs to the group's early albums, and lead guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] later recorded Johnson's entire catalogue in two albums, ''[[The Robert Johnson Songbook]]'' and ''[[Hot Foot Powder (album)|Hot Foot Powder]]''.\n* [[Sam Dunn]]'s documentary ''[[Metal Evolution]]'' cites Johnson as the \"great grandfather to all things heavy metal\", with members of the bands [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music.\n* [[Bob Dylan]] wrote of Johnson in his 2004 autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', \"If I hadn't heard the Robert Johnson record when I did, there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down\u2014that I wouldn't have felt free enough or upraised enough to write.\"<ref name=\"Dylan\"/>\n\n===Guitar technique===\n[[File:Robert-Johnson-Gibson L1.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Gibson L-1]] guitar, subsequently reissued by Gibson as a tribute to Johnson]]\nJohnson's revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary critics, assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available, to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time:\n* In 1990, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine'' rated him first in its list of \"35 Guitar Gods\"\u2014on the 52nd anniversary of his death.<ref>\"35 Guitar Gods\".

That he was not listed among his mother's children in the [[1910 United States Census|1910 census]]<ref name=\"Freeland 2000\">Freeland 2000.</ref> casts further doubt on these dates. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Robert's mother, remembered his birth date as May&nbsp;8, 1911.

His death certificate, discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his death.<ref>Wardlow and Komara 1998, p. 87.</ref>\n\nJohnson's records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release, and efforts were made to discover his biography, with virtually no success. The blues researcher [[Mack McCormick]] began researching his family background in 1972, but died in 2015 without ever publishing his findings. McCormick's research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted [[Peter Guralnick]] to publish a summary in ''Living Blues'' (1982), later reprinted in book form as ''Searching for Robert Johnson''.<ref>Guralnick</ref> Later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details.

Shines, Edwards and Robert Lockwood contribute interviews. These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives, partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts.\n\nA relatively full account of Johnson's brief musical career emerged in the 1960s, largely from accounts by Son House, Johnny Shines, David Honeyboy Edwards and Robert Lockwood. In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' included reminiscences of [[Don Law]] who had recorded Johnson in 1936. Law added to the mystique surrounding Johnson, representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy.\n\n===Photographs===\nThe two confirmed images of Johnson were located in 1973, in the possession of his half-sister Carrie Thompson, but were not widely published until the late 1980s.

This photograph has never been made public.\n\n===Descendants===\nJohnson left no [[Will and testament|will]]. In 1998, the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] ruled that Claud Johnson, a retired truck driver living in [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi]], was the son of Robert Johnson and his only heir. The court heard that he had been born to Virgie Jane Smith (later Virgie Jane Cain), who had a relationship with Robert Johnson in 1931. The relationship was attested to by a friend, Eula Mae Williams, but other relatives descended from Robert Johnson's half-sister, Carrie Harris Thompson, contested Claud Johnson's claim. The effect of the judgment was to allow Claud Johnson to receive over $1 million in royalties.<ref>{{cite news | title=Court Rules Father of the Blues Has a Son | newspaper=New York Times | author=Bragg, Rick | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/17/us/court-rules-father-of-the-blues-has-a-son.html | accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> Claud Johnson died, aged 83, on June 30, 2015, leaving six children.<ref>{{cite news | title=Claud Johnson, Son of Blues Singer, Dies at 83 | newspaper=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/arts/music/claud-johnson-83-son-of-blues-singer.html?_r=0 | accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other Robert Johnsons ===\nThe ''[[Radiolab]]'' podcast \"Crossroads\", broadcast initially April 16, 2012, on [[VPR|NPR]], raises the possibility that more than one Robert Johnson was traveling around the region making music at the time of the subject's life \u2014 perhaps confusing related biographical information. Producers of the show spoke with Tom Graves, Elijah Wald, David Evans, and [[Mack McCormick|Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] to support this theory. The death certificate attributed to Johnson, for example, indicates on the reverse side that (possibly another) Robert Johnson came to the area to play banjo (not guitar) and died of [[syphilis]]. This could help explain some of the confusion surrounding Johnson's cause of death.\n\nJohnson was also reportedly seen twice after his supposed death, once in 1939 and another time in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/199705-crossroads/|title=Crossroads|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Robert Johnson discography}}\n{{listen\n| filename = Traveling Riverside Blues sample.ogg\n| title = Traveling Riverside Blues\n| format  = [[ogg]]\n| filename2 = Crossroads.ogg\n| title2 = Cross Road Blues\n| format2 [[ogg]]\n}}\nEleven 78-rpm records by Johnson were released by [[Vocalion Records]] during his lifetime.

For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, [[syrup]] has a higher viscosity than [[water]].{{sfn|Symon|1971|p=}}\n\nViscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal [[friction|frictional force]] that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube.  This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;{{sfn|Balescu|1975|pp=428\u2013429}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=}} such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\"etym_visc\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity.]]\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], one is often interested in understanding the forces, or [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], involved in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by [[Hooke's law]], which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the ''distance'' the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how ''quickly'' the shearing occurs.\n\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar [[Couette flow]].\n\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed <math>u</math> (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from <math>0</math> at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|p=19}} Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top. Moreover, the magnitude <math>F</math> of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed <math>u</math> and the area <math>A</math> of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation <math>y</math>: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor <math>\\mu</math> is the viscosity of the fluid, with units of <math>\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}</math> ([[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-[[second]]). The ratio <math>u/y</math> is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with <math>y</math>, then the appropriate generalization is\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere <math>\\tau = F / A</math>, and <math>\\partial u / \\partial y</math> is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what ''defines'' <math>\\mu</math>. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] (<math>\\mu</math>) for the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.{{sfn|Streeter|Wylie|Bedford|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Holman|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Incropera|DeWitt|Bergman|Lavine|2007|p=}}  However, the [[eta (letter)|Greek letter eta]] (<math>\\eta</math>) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the [[IUPAC]].{{sfn|Ni\u010d|Jir\u00e1t|Ko\u0161ata|Jenkins|1997|p=}} The viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is sometimes also referred to as the ''shear viscosity''. However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that <math>\\mu</math> can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to shearing flows.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p = 19}}\n\n=== General definition ===\n{{See also|Viscous stress tensor|Volume viscosity}}\n\nIn very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|pp=44\u201345}} (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_{ij} = \\sum_k \\sum_\\ell \\mu_{ijk\\ell} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial r_\\ell},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{ijk\\ell}</math> is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor <math>\\partial v_k / \\partial r_\\ell</math> onto the viscous stress tensor <math>\\tau_{ij}</math>.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p= 18|ps=: Note that this source uses an alternative sign convention, which has been reversed here.}} Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 \"viscosity coefficients\" <math>\\mu_{ijkl}</math> in total. However, due to spatial symmetries these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity <math>\\mu</math> and the [[bulk viscosity]] <math>\\kappa</math>:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\dagger} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa \\right) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{\\delta},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{\\delta}</math> is the unit tensor, and the dagger <math>\\dagger</math> denotes the [[transpose]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=45}} This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of <math>\\kappa</math> is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0</math> and so the term containing <math>\\kappa</math> drops out. Moreover, <math>\\kappa</math> is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is <math>0</math> in a [[monoatomic]] [[ideal gas]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}} One situation in which <math>\\kappa</math> can be important is the calculation of energy loss in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s, described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]], since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n=== Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the ''kinematic viscosity'' (also called \"momentum diffusivity\"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} to the [[density]] of the fluid {{mvar|\u03c1}}. It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}) and has [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] <math>\\mathrm{(length)^2/time}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.</math>\n\nConsistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is frequently called the ''dynamic viscosity'' or ''absolute viscosity'', and has units force \u00d7 time/area.\n\n==Momentum transport==\n{{See also|Transport phenomena}}\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as [[thermal conductivity]] characterizes [[heat]] transport, and (mass) [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]] characterizes mass transport.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, <math>\\tau = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)</math>, the shear stress <math>\\tau</math> has units equivalent to a momentum [[flux]], i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, <math>\\tau</math> can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the <math>y</math> direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\n\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called [[constitutive relations]], whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J} &= -D \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\mathbf{q} &= -k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\tau &= \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & & \\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> are the mass and heat fluxes, and <math>D</math> and <math>k_t</math> are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.{{sfn|Schroeder|1999|p=}} The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], and [[Ohm's law]]) which serves to define the viscosity <math>\\mu</math>. Its form  is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, <math>\\mu</math> is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]]. [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\n* [[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Rheopectic]] (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\n[[Frederick Thomas Trouton|Trouton]]'s ratio is the ratio of [[extensional viscosity]] to [[shear viscosity]]. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.{{sfn|R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska| R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski| Ochowiak| Mitkowski|2014|pp=47\u201355}}{{sfn|Trouton|1906|pp= 426\u2013440}} Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==In solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time. (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.{{sfn|Kumagai|Sasajima |Ito|1978|pp=157\u2013161}} Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The [[extensional viscosity]] is a [[linear combination]] of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\n\nIn [[geology]], earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called [[rheid]]s.{{sfn|Scherer|Pardenek|Swiatek|1988|p=14}}\n\n==Measurement==\n{{Main|Viscometer}}\nViscosity is measured with various types of [[viscometer]]s and [[rheometer]]s. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hannan |first1=Henry |title=Technician's Formulation Handbook for Industrial and Household Cleaning Products |date=2007 |publisher=Kyral LLC |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-6151-5601-9 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nFor some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ([[Newtonian fluids]]). The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured with various [[rheometer]]s that apply [[extensional stress]].\n\n[[Volume viscosity]] can be measured with an [[acoustic rheometer]].\n\n[[Apparent viscosity]] is a calculation derived from tests performed on [[drilling fluid]] used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\n\n==Units==\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of dynamic viscosity is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-second (Pa\u00b7s), or equivalently [[kilogram]] per [[metre|meter]] per second (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The [[CGS system|CGS]] unit is the [[poise (unit)|poise]] (P, or g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s),{{sfn|McNaught|Wilkinson|1997|loc=poise}} named after [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It is commonly expressed, particularly in [[ASTM]] standards, as ''centipoise'' (cP) since the latter is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa\u00b7s).\n\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m<sup>2</sup>/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the '''stokes''' (St, or cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>), named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]].{{sfn|Gyllenbok |2018|p=213}}  In U.S. usage, ''stoke'' is sometimes used as the singular form.  The submultiple ''centistokes'' (cSt) is often used instead, 1\u00a0cSt\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0= 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by <math>\\phi = 1 / \\mu</math> or <math>F = 1 / \\mu</math>, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. Fluidity is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nNonstandard units include the [[reyn]], a British unit of dynamic viscosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the automotive industry the [[viscosity index]] is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\n\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the [[Saybolt viscometer]], and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of [[Saybolt universal second]]s (SUS).<ref name=\"ASTM D2161\" /> Other abbreviations such as SSU (''Saybolt seconds universal'') or SUV (''Saybolt universal viscosity'') are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in [[ASTM]] D 2161.\n\n==Molecular origins==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] for the linear shear viscosity or the ''transient time correlation function'' expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988.{{sfn|Evans | Morriss | 1988|pp=4142\u20134148}} Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the [[equations of motion]] of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]], which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the [[Boltzmann equation]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}}\n\nMomentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n===Pure gases===\n\n{{See also||Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

The quantity <math>\\lambda</math>, the [[mean free path]], measures the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Even without ''a priori'' knowledge of <math>\\alpha</math>, this expression has interesting implications. In particular, since <math>\\lambda</math> is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with temperature, <math>\\mu</math> itself should increase with temperature and be ''independent'' of density at fixed temperature. In fact, both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and accurately describe experimental observations. Note that this behavior runs counter to common intuition regarding liquids, for which viscosity typically ''decreases'' with temperature.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}}{{sfn|Bellac|Mortessagne|Batrouni|2004|p=}}\n\nFor rigid elastic spheres of diameter <math>\\sigma</math>, <math>\\lambda</math> can be computed, giving\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi^{3/2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{k_\\text{B} m T}}{\\sigma^2}.\n</math>\n\nIn this case <math>\\lambda</math> is independent of temperature, so <math>\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}</math>. For more complicated molecular models, however, <math>\\lambda</math> depends on temperature in a non-trivial way, and simple kinetic arguments as used here are inadequate. More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=103}}\n\n====Chapman\u2013Enskog theory====\n\n{{Main||Chapman\u2013Enskog theory}}\n\nA technique developed by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]] in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of <math>\\mu</math>.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} It is based on the [[Boltzmann equation]], which provides a systematic statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Cercignani|1975|p=}} As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of <math>\\mu</math> for more realistic molecular models, such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-core repulsion.\n\nIt turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of <math>\\mu</math>, which experiments show increases more rapidly than the <math>T^{1/2}</math> trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model,{{efn|The discussion which follows draws from {{harvnb|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp=232\u2013237}} }} which describes rigid elastic spheres with ''weak'' mutual attraction. In such a case, the attractive force can be treated [[Perturbation theory|perturbatively]], which leads to a particularly simple expression for <math>\\mu</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\frac{5}{16 \\sigma^2} \\left(\\frac{k_\\text{B} m T}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} \\left(1 + \\frac{S}{T} \\right)^{-1},\n</math>\nwhere <math>S</math> is independent of temperature, being determined only by the parameters of the intermolecular attraction. To connect with experiment, it is convenient to rewrite as\n\n:<math>\n\\mu = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{3/2} \\frac{T_0 + S}{T + S},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity at temperature <math>T_0</math>.{{sfn|Sutherland|1893|pp=507\u2013531}} If <math>\\mu</math> is known from experiments at <math>T = T_0</math> and at least one other temperature, then <math>S</math> can be calculated. It turns out that expressions for <math>\\mu</math> obtained in this way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures. On the other hand, {{harvnb|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} argue that this success does not imply that molecules actually interact according to the Sutherland model. Rather, they interpret the prediction for <math>\\mu</math> as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. In some systems the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned as well, as is the case for vapors with highly [[polar molecules]] like [[Properties of water|H<sub>2</sub>O]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp= 235\u2013237}}\n\n==== Bulk viscosity ====\n\nIn the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. [[Rotational energy|rotational]] and [[vibration]]al. As such, the bulk viscosity is <math>0</math> for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules in negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like [[carbon dioxide]], whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp= 197, 214\u2013216}}{{sfn|Cramer|2012|p=066102-2}}\n\n===Pure liquids===\n{{See also||Temperature dependence of liquid viscosity}}\n\n[[File:Viscosity video science museum.ogv|thumb|Video showing three liquids with different viscosities]]\n[[File:09. \u0412\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.ogg|thumb|Experiment showing the behavior of a viscous fluid with blue dye for visibility]]\n\nIn contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the molecular origins of viscosity in liquids.\n\nAt the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces\nacting across the layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease with increasing temperature. This is because\nincreasing temperature increases the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to overcome their attractive interactions.{{sfn|Reid|Sherwood|1958|p=202}}\n\nBuilding on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid \nare visualized as forming \"cages\" which surround and enclose single molecules.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=29\u201331}} These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and\nstronger molecular attraction corresponds to stronger cages.\nDue to random thermal motion, a molecule \"hops\" between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular attractions.

In particular, a negative value of <math>B</math> is able to account for the decrease in viscosity observed in some solutions. Estimated values of these constants are shown below for sodium chloride and potassium iodide at temperature 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (mol = [[Mole (unit)|mole]], L = [[liter]]).{{sfn|Viswanath|Ghosh|Prasad|Dutt|2007|p=}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Solute\n! scope=\"col\"| <math>A</math> (mol<sup>\u22121/2</sup> L<sup>1/2</sup>)\n! scope=\"col\"| <math>B</math> (mol<sup>\u22121</sup> L)\n! scope=\"col\"| <math>C</math> (mol<sup>\u22122</sup> L<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Sodium chloride]] (NaCl)\n|0.0062\n|0.0793\n|0.0080\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Potassium iodide]] (KI)\n|0.0047\n|\u22120.0755\n|0.0000\n|-\n|}\n\n====Suspensions====\n\nIn a suspension of solid particles (e.g. [[micron]]-size spheres suspended in oil), an effective viscosity <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> can be defined in terms of stress and strain components which are averaged over a volume large compared with the distance between the suspended particles, but small with respect to macroscopic dimensions.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=31\u201333}} Such suspensions generally exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and expressions for <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> can be derived directly from the particle dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction <math>\\phi \\lesssim 0.02</math>, interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored. In such a case one can explicitly calculate the flow field around each particle independently, and combine the results to obtain <math>\\mu_\\text{eff}</math>. For spheres, this results in the Einstein equation:\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{2} \\phi \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity of the suspending liquid. The linear dependence on <math>\\phi</math> is a direct consequence of neglecting interparticle interactions; in general, one will have\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + B \\phi \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere the coefficient <math>B</math> may depend on the particle shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks).{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=32}} Experimental determination of the precise value of <math>B</math> is difficult, however: even the prediction <math>B = 5/2</math> for spheres has not been conclusively validated, with various experiments finding values in the range <math>1.5 \\lesssim B \\lesssim 5</math>. This deficiency has been attributed to difficulty in controlling experimental conditions.{{sfn|Mueller|Llewellin|Mader|2009|pp=1201\u20131228}}\n\nIn denser suspensions, <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> acquires a nonlinear dependence on <math>\\phi</math>, which indicates the importance of interparticle interactions. Various analytical and semi-empirical schemes exist for capturing this regime. At the most basic level, a term quadratic in <math>\\phi</math> is added to <math>\\mu_\\text{eff}</math>:\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + B \\phi + B_1 \\phi^2 \\right),\n</math>\n\nand the coefficient <math>B_1</math> is fit from experimental data or approximated from the microscopic theory. In general, however, one should be cautious in applying such simple formulas since non-Newtonian behavior appears in dense suspensions (<math>\\phi \\gtrsim 0.25</math> for spheres),{{sfn|Mueller|Llewellin|Mader|2009|pp=1201\u20131228}} or in suspensions of elongated or flexible particles.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=31\u201333}}\n\nThere is a distinction between a suspension of solid particles, described above, and an [[emulsion]]. The latter is a suspension of tiny droplets, which themselves may exhibit internal circulation. The presence of internal circulation can noticeably decrease the observed effective viscosity, and different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=33}}\n\n===Amorphous materials===\n\n[[File:Glassviscosityexamples.png|upright=1.6|thumb|Common [[glass]] viscosity curves{{sfn|Fluegel|2007}}]]\n\nIn the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in [[Amorphous solid|amorphous materials]] (e.g. in [[glass]]es and melts){{sfn|Doremus|2002|pp=7619\u20137629}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Lee|2004|pp=3803\u20133810}} has the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius form]]:\n\n:<math>\\mu = A e^{Q/(RT)},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|Q}} is a relevant [[activation energy]], given in terms of molecular parameters; {{mvar|T}} is temperature; {{mvar|R}} is the molar [[gas constant]]; and {{mvar|A}} is approximately a constant.

Besides being a convenient fit to data, the expression can also be derived from various theoretical models of amorphous materials at the atomic level.{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}\n\nA similar two-exponential equation can be derived within the Dyre shoving model of supercooled liquids, where the Arrhenius energy barrier is identified with the high-frequency [[shear modulus]] times a characteristic shoving volume.{{sfn|Dyre|Olsen|Christensen|1996|p=2171}} Upon specifying the temperature dependence of the shear modulus via thermal expansion and via the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, a two-exponential equation is retrieved as in the Krausser-Samwer-Zaccone (KSZ) equation.

For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, [[syrup]] has a higher viscosity than [[water]].{{sfn|Symon|1971|p=}}\n\nViscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal [[friction|frictional force]] that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. For instance, when a fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. In such a case, experiments show that some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube.  This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion: the strength of this force is proportional to the viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires all fluids to have positive viscosity;{{sfn|Balescu|1975|pp=428\u2013429}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=}} such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid. A fluid with a high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\"etym_visc\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Simple definition ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|Illustration of a planar Couette flow. Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity.]]\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], one is often interested in understanding the forces, or [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], involved in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by [[Hooke's law]], which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time. These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the ''distance'' the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how ''quickly'' the shearing occurs.\n\nViscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar [[Couette flow]].\n\nIn the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed <math>u</math> (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from <math>0</math> at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|p=19}} Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nIn many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to <math>u</math> at the top. Moreover, the magnitude <math>F</math> of the force acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed <math>u</math> and the area <math>A</math> of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation <math>y</math>: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor <math>\\mu</math> is the viscosity of the fluid, with units of <math>\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}</math> ([[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-[[second]]). The ratio <math>u/y</math> is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with <math>y</math>, then the appropriate generalization is\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere <math>\\tau = F / A</math>, and <math>\\partial u / \\partial y</math> is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity. In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what ''defines'' <math>\\mu</math>. It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] (<math>\\mu</math>) for the viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.{{sfn|Streeter|Wylie|Bedford|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Holman|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Incropera|DeWitt|Bergman|Lavine|2007|p=}}  However, the [[eta (letter)|Greek letter eta]] (<math>\\eta</math>) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the [[IUPAC]].{{sfn|Ni\u010d|Jir\u00e1t|Ko\u0161ata|Jenkins|1997|p=}} The viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is sometimes also referred to as the ''shear viscosity''. However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that <math>\\mu</math> can appear in nonshearing flows in addition to shearing flows.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p = 19}}\n\n=== General definition ===\n{{See also|Viscous stress tensor|Volume viscosity}}\n\nIn very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity.{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|pp=44\u201345}} (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_{ij} = \\sum_k \\sum_\\ell \\mu_{ijk\\ell} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial r_\\ell},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{ijk\\ell}</math> is a viscosity tensor that maps the strain rate tensor <math>\\partial v_k / \\partial r_\\ell</math> onto the viscous stress tensor <math>\\tau_{ij}</math>.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p= 18|ps=: Note that this source uses an alternative sign convention, which has been reversed here.}} Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 \"viscosity coefficients\" <math>\\mu_{ijkl}</math> in total. However, due to spatial symmetries these coefficients are not all independent. For instance, for [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, the 81 coefficients can be reduced to 2 independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the standard (scalar) viscosity <math>\\mu</math> and the [[bulk viscosity]] <math>\\kappa</math>:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mu \\left[\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\dagger} \\right] - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa \\right) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{\\delta},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{\\delta}</math> is the unit tensor, and the dagger <math>\\dagger</math> denotes the [[transpose]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}}{{sfn|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|p=45}} This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of <math>\\kappa</math> is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0</math> and so the term containing <math>\\kappa</math> drops out. Moreover, <math>\\kappa</math> is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is <math>0</math> in a [[monoatomic]] [[ideal gas]].{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=19}} One situation in which <math>\\kappa</math> can be important is the calculation of energy loss in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s, described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]], since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the above expressions are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather definitions of viscosity. As such, their utility for any given material, as well as means for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means.\n\n=== Dynamic and kinematic viscosity ===\nIn fluid dynamics, it is common to work in terms of the ''kinematic viscosity'' (also called \"momentum diffusivity\"), defined as the ratio of the viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} to the [[density]] of the fluid {{mvar|\u03c1}}. It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}) and has [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] <math>\\mathrm{(length)^2/time}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.</math>\n\nConsistent with this nomenclature, the viscosity <math>\\mu</math> is frequently called the ''dynamic viscosity'' or ''absolute viscosity'', and has units force \u00d7 time/area.\n\n==Momentum transport==\n{{See also|Transport phenomena}}\n\nTransport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as [[thermal conductivity]] characterizes [[heat]] transport, and (mass) [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]] characterizes mass transport.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} To see this, note that in Newton's law of viscosity, <math>\\tau = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)</math>, the shear stress <math>\\tau</math> has units equivalent to a momentum [[flux]], i.e. momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, <math>\\tau</math> can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the <math>y</math> direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity.\n\nThe analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called [[constitutive relations]], whose one-dimensional forms are given here:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J} &= -D \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\mathbf{q} &= -k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} & & \\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)} \\\\[5pt]\n\\tau &= \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & & \\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> are the mass and heat fluxes, and <math>D</math> and <math>k_t</math> are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity.{{sfn|Schroeder|1999|p=}} The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials.]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], and [[Ohm's law]]) which serves to define the viscosity <math>\\mu</math>. Its form  is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, <math>\\mu</math> is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]]. [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example:\n\n* [[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n* [[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Rheopectic]] (dilatant) liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n* [[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\n[[Frederick Thomas Trouton|Trouton]]'s ratio is the ratio of [[extensional viscosity]] to [[shear viscosity]]. For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3.{{sfn|R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska| R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski| Ochowiak| Mitkowski|2014|pp=47\u201355}}{{sfn|Trouton|1906|pp= 426\u2013440}} Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.{{sfn|Mewis|Wagner|2012|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature. For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==In solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time. (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.{{sfn|Kumagai|Sasajima |Ito|1978|pp=157\u2013161}} Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The [[extensional viscosity]] is a [[linear combination]] of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers.\n\nIn [[geology]], earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called [[rheid]]s.{{sfn|Scherer|Pardenek|Swiatek|1988|p=14}}\n\n==Measurement==\n{{Main|Viscometer}}\nViscosity is measured with various types of [[viscometer]]s and [[rheometer]]s. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hannan |first1=Henry |title=Technician's Formulation Handbook for Industrial and Household Cleaning Products |date=2007 |publisher=Kyral LLC |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-6151-5601-9 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nFor some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ([[Newtonian fluids]]). The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured. There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured with various [[rheometer]]s that apply [[extensional stress]].\n\n[[Volume viscosity]] can be measured with an [[acoustic rheometer]].\n\n[[Apparent viscosity]] is a calculation derived from tests performed on [[drilling fluid]] used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required.\n\n==Units==\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of dynamic viscosity is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]-second (Pa\u00b7s), or equivalently [[kilogram]] per [[metre|meter]] per second (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>). The [[CGS system|CGS]] unit is the [[poise (unit)|poise]] (P, or g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.1 Pa\u00b7s),{{sfn|McNaught|Wilkinson|1997|loc=poise}} named after [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]]. It is commonly expressed, particularly in [[ASTM]] standards, as ''centipoise'' (cP) since the latter is equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa\u00b7s).\n\nThe SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m<sup>2</sup>/s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the '''stokes''' (St, or cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>), named after Sir [[George Gabriel Stokes]].{{sfn|Gyllenbok |2018|p=213}}  In U.S. usage, ''stoke'' is sometimes used as the singular form.  The submultiple ''centistokes'' (cSt) is often used instead, 1\u00a0cSt\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0= 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by <math>\\phi = 1 / \\mu</math> or <math>F = 1 / \\mu</math>, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. Fluidity is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nNonstandard units include the [[reyn]], a British unit of dynamic viscosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the automotive industry the [[viscosity index]] is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature.\n\nAt one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the [[Saybolt viscometer]], and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of [[Saybolt universal second]]s (SUS).<ref name=\"ASTM D2161\" /> Other abbreviations such as SSU (''Saybolt seconds universal'') or SUV (''Saybolt universal viscosity'') are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in [[ASTM]] D 2161.\n\n==Molecular origins==\nIn general, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact. There are no simple but correct expressions for the viscosity of a fluid. The simplest exact expressions are the [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] for the linear shear viscosity or the ''transient time correlation function'' expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988.{{sfn|Evans | Morriss | 1988|pp=4142\u20134148}} Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of [[molecular dynamics]] computer simulations. On the other hand, much more progress can be made for a dilute gas. Even elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the [[equations of motion]] of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]], which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the [[Boltzmann equation]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}}\n\nMomentum transport in gases is generally mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces which bind molecules close together.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases.\n\n===Pure gases===\n\n{{See also||Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

Even without ''a priori'' knowledge of <math>\\alpha</math>, this expression has interesting implications. In particular, since <math>\\lambda</math> is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with temperature, <math>\\mu</math> itself should increase with temperature and be ''independent'' of density at fixed temperature. In fact, both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and accurately describe experimental observations.

For more complicated molecular models, however, <math>\\lambda</math> depends on temperature in a non-trivial way, and simple kinetic arguments as used here are inadequate. More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=103}}\n\n====Chapman\u2013Enskog theory====\n\n{{Main||Chapman\u2013Enskog theory}}\n\nA technique developed by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]] in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of <math>\\mu</math>.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} It is based on the [[Boltzmann equation]], which provides a systematic statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Cercignani|1975|p=}} As such, their technique allows accurate calculation of <math>\\mu</math> for more realistic molecular models, such as those incorporating intermolecular attraction rather than just hard-core repulsion.\n\nIt turns out that a more realistic modeling of interactions is essential for accurate prediction of the temperature dependence of <math>\\mu</math>, which experiments show increases more rapidly than the <math>T^{1/2}</math> trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=}} Indeed, the Chapman\u2013Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model,{{efn|The discussion which follows draws from {{harvnb|Chapman|Cowling|1970|pp=232\u2013237}} }} which describes rigid elastic spheres with ''weak'' mutual attraction.

It turns out that expressions for <math>\\mu</math> obtained in this way are accurate for a number of gases over a sizable range of temperatures.

Rather, they interpret the prediction for <math>\\mu</math> as a simple interpolation which is valid for some gases over fixed ranges of temperature, but otherwise does not provide a picture of intermolecular interactions which is fundamentally correct and general. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], may provide a better picture, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature.

A classic example \nof this approach is Irving\u2013Kirkwood theory.{{sfn|Irving|Kirkwood|1949|pp=817\u2013829}} On the other hand, such expressions\nare given as averages over multiparticle [[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation functions]] and are therefore difficult to apply in practice.\n\nIn general, empirically derived expressions (based on existing viscosity measurements) appear to be the only consistently reliable means of calculating viscosity in liquids.{{sfn|Reid|Sherwood|1958|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\n===Mixtures and blends===\n{{See also|Viscosity models for mixtures}}\n\n====Gaseous mixtures====\n\nThe same molecular-kinetic picture of a single component gas can also be applied to a gaseous mixture. For instance, in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach the viscosity <math>\\mu_{\\text{mix}}</math> of a binary mixture of gases can be written in terms of the individual component viscosities <math>\\mu_{1,2}</math>, their respective volume fractions, and the intermolecular interactions.{{sfn|Chapman|Cowling|1970|p=}} As for the single-component gas, the dependence of <math>\\mu_{\\text{mix}}</math> on the parameters of the intermolecular interactions enters through various collisional integrals which may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions. To obtain usable expressions for <math>\\mu_{\\text{mix}}</math> which reasonably match experimental data, the collisional integrals typically must be evaluated using some combination of analytic calculation and empirical fitting. An example of such a procedure is the Sutherland approach for the single-component gas, discussed above.\n\n====Blends of liquids====\n\nAs for pure liquids, the viscosity of a blend of liquids is difficult to predict from molecular principles. One method is to extend the molecular \"cage\" theory presented above for a pure liquid. This can be done with varying levels of sophistication. One useful expression resulting from such an analysis is the Lederer\u2013Roegiers equation for a binary mixture:\n\n:<math>\n\\ln \\mu_\\text{blend} = \\frac{x_1}{x_1 + \\alpha x_2} \\ln \\mu_1 + \\frac{\\alpha x_2}{x_1 + \\alpha x_2} \\ln \\mu_2,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is an empirical parameter, and <math>x_{1,2}</math> and <math>\\mu_{1,2}</math> are the respective [[mole fractions]] and viscosities of the component liquids.{{sfn|Zhmud|2014|p=22}}\n\nSince blending is an important process in the lubricating and oil industries, a variety of empirical and propriety equations exist for predicting the viscosity of a blend, besides those stemming directly from molecular theory.{{sfn|Zhmud|2014|p=22}}\n\n===Solutions and suspensions===\n====Aqeuous solutions====\n{{See also|Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel theory|List of viscosities#Aqueous_solutions}}\nDepending on the [[solute]] and range of concentration, an aqueous [[electrolyte]] solution can have either a larger or smaller viscosity compared with pure water at the same temperature and pressure. For instance, a 20% saline ([[sodium chloride]]) solution has viscosity over 1.5 times that of pure water, whereas a 20% [[potassium iodide]] solution has viscosity about 0.91 times that of pure water.\n\nAn idealized model of dilute electrolytic solutions leads to the following prediction for the viscosity <math>\\mu_s</math> of a solution:{{sfn|Viswanath|Ghosh|Prasad|Dutt|2007|p=}}\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\mu_s}{\\mu_0} = 1 + A \\sqrt{c},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity of the solvent, <math>c</math> is the concentration, and <math>A</math> is a positive constant which depends on both solvent and solute properties. However, this expression is only valid for very dilute solutions, having <math>c</math> less than 0.1&nbsp;mol/L.{{sfn|Abdulagatov|Zeinalova|Azizov|2006|pp=75\u201388}} For higher concentrations, additional terms are necessary which account for higher-order molecular correlations:\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\mu_s}{\\mu_0} = 1 + A \\sqrt{c} + B c + C c^2,\n</math>\nwhere <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are fit from data. In particular, a negative value of <math>B</math> is able to account for the decrease in viscosity observed in some solutions. Estimated values of these constants are shown below for sodium chloride and potassium iodide at temperature 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (mol = [[Mole (unit)|mole]], L = [[liter]]).{{sfn|Viswanath|Ghosh|Prasad|Dutt|2007|p=}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Solute\n! scope=\"col\"| <math>A</math> (mol<sup>\u22121/2</sup> L<sup>1/2</sup>)\n! scope=\"col\"| <math>B</math> (mol<sup>\u22121</sup> L)\n! scope=\"col\"| <math>C</math> (mol<sup>\u22122</sup> L<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Sodium chloride]] (NaCl)\n|0.0062\n|0.0793\n|0.0080\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Potassium iodide]] (KI)\n|0.0047\n|\u22120.0755\n|0.0000\n|-\n|}\n\n====Suspensions====\n\nIn a suspension of solid particles (e.g. [[micron]]-size spheres suspended in oil), an effective viscosity <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> can be defined in terms of stress and strain components which are averaged over a volume large compared with the distance between the suspended particles, but small with respect to macroscopic dimensions.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=31\u201333}} Such suspensions generally exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and expressions for <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> can be derived directly from the particle dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction <math>\\phi \\lesssim 0.02</math>, interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored. In such a case one can explicitly calculate the flow field around each particle independently, and combine the results to obtain <math>\\mu_\\text{eff}</math>. For spheres, this results in the Einstein equation:\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{2} \\phi \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_0</math> is the viscosity of the suspending liquid. The linear dependence on <math>\\phi</math> is a direct consequence of neglecting interparticle interactions; in general, one will have\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + B \\phi \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere the coefficient <math>B</math> may depend on the particle shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks).{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=32}} Experimental determination of the precise value of <math>B</math> is difficult, however: even the prediction <math>B = 5/2</math> for spheres has not been conclusively validated, with various experiments finding values in the range <math>1.5 \\lesssim B \\lesssim 5</math>. This deficiency has been attributed to difficulty in controlling experimental conditions.{{sfn|Mueller|Llewellin|Mader|2009|pp=1201\u20131228}}\n\nIn denser suspensions, <math>\\mu_{\\text{eff}}</math> acquires a nonlinear dependence on <math>\\phi</math>, which indicates the importance of interparticle interactions. Various analytical and semi-empirical schemes exist for capturing this regime. At the most basic level, a term quadratic in <math>\\phi</math> is added to <math>\\mu_\\text{eff}</math>:\n\n: <math>\n\\mu_\\text{eff} = \\mu_0 \\left(1 + B \\phi + B_1 \\phi^2 \\right),\n</math>\n\nand the coefficient <math>B_1</math> is fit from experimental data or approximated from the microscopic theory. In general, however, one should be cautious in applying such simple formulas since non-Newtonian behavior appears in dense suspensions (<math>\\phi \\gtrsim 0.25</math> for spheres),{{sfn|Mueller|Llewellin|Mader|2009|pp=1201\u20131228}} or in suspensions of elongated or flexible particles.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| pp=31\u201333}}\n\nThere is a distinction between a suspension of solid particles, described above, and an [[emulsion]]. The latter is a suspension of tiny droplets, which themselves may exhibit internal circulation. The presence of internal circulation can noticeably decrease the observed effective viscosity, and different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used.{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=33}}\n\n===Amorphous materials===\n\n[[File:Glassviscosityexamples.png|upright=1.6|thumb|Common [[glass]] viscosity curves{{sfn|Fluegel|2007}}]]\n\nIn the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in [[Amorphous solid|amorphous materials]] (e.g. in [[glass]]es and melts){{sfn|Doremus|2002|pp=7619\u20137629}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}{{sfn|Ojovan|Lee|2004|pp=3803\u20133810}} has the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius form]]:\n\n:<math>\\mu = A e^{Q/(RT)},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|Q}} is a relevant [[activation energy]], given in terms of molecular parameters; {{mvar|T}} is temperature; {{mvar|R}} is the molar [[gas constant]]; and {{mvar|A}} is approximately a constant.

Besides being a convenient fit to data, the expression can also be derived from various theoretical models of amorphous materials at the atomic level.{{sfn|Ojovan|Travis|Hand|2007|p=415107}}\n\nA similar two-exponential equation can be derived within the Dyre shoving model of supercooled liquids, where the Arrhenius energy barrier is identified with the high-frequency [[shear modulus]] times a characteristic shoving volume.{{sfn|Dyre|Olsen|Christensen|1996|p=2171}}. Upon specifying the temperature dependence of the shear modulus via thermal expansion and via the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, a two-exponential equation is retrieved as in the Krausser-Samwer-Zaccone (KSZ) equation. The parameters in the KSZ equation are specified in terms of the repulsive part of the atomic or molecular interaction, as well as the [[thermal expansion]] coefficient and the [[glass transition]] temperature of the system.{{sfn|Krausser|Samwer|Zaccone|2015|p=13762}}\n\n===Eddy viscosity===\nIn the study of [[turbulence]] in [[fluid]]s, a common practical strategy is to ignore the small-scale [[vortex|vortices]] (or [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]) in the motion and to calculate a large-scale motion with an ''effective'' viscosity, called the \"eddy viscosity\", which characterizes the transport and dissipation of [[energy]] in the smaller-scale flow (see [[large eddy simulation]]).{{sfn|Bird| Stewart| Lightfoot| 2007| p=163}}{{sfn|Lesieur|2012|pp=2\u2013}} In contrast to the viscosity of the fluid itself, which must be positive by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], the eddy viscosity can be negative.{{sfn|Sivashinsky|Yakhot|1985|p=1040}}{{sfn|Xie|Levchenko|2019|p=045434}}\n\n==Selected substances==\n[[File:University of Queensland Pitch drop experiment-white bg.jpg|thumb|upright|In the University of Queensland [[pitch drop experiment]], pitch has been dripping slowly through a funnel since 1927, at a rate of one drop roughly every decade.

Unbeknownst to Pete, Ae is also drawn to Pete's innocence and immense kindness. But Pete is wary and knows painfully well that he's different than many other boys due to his sexuality.
