summaries==\nOklahoma had won the AP National Title in 1974 and began the year by thrashing Oregon 62-7 in Norman.  OU played host to a [[Johnny Majors]] coached #15 Pittsburgh squad, sporting junior running back sensation [[Tony Dorsett]] (only a year away from the [[Heisman trophy]] and the collegiate rushing record), and they dominated, outscoring the Panthers 46&ndash;10. But a trip to unranked Miami was nearly fatal.  The Sooners scored all 20 of their points in the second quarter and finished with just 163 rushing yards and 176 total, barely surviving a ten&ndash;point Hurricanes' fourth quarter en route to a 20&ndash;17 victory. That win was not enough to knock the Sooners to the second spot in the polls, but a one-point win over Colorado the following week was. Against the Buffaloes, the vaunted Sooner wishbone offense looked abysmal, and they surrendered a 14&ndash;point lead in the second half. A botched CU extra point in the final 79 seconds proved the difference. [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] took over the number one ranking. The Sooners, despite the close calls, came into Dallas atop a 24&ndash;game winning streak and a 33-game unbeaten streak and ranked #2 in the country.<ref name=\"1975 Oklahoma Season\">{{cite web|url=http://soonerstats.com/football/games/recap.cfm?GameID=731|title=Beginning of Oklahoma Sooners 1975 Football Season|publisher=Soonerstats.com|year=2007|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Oregon===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Oregon\n|V1=7 |V2=0 |V3=0 |V4=0\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1=10 |H2=33 |H3= 7|H4=12\n|Date=September 13\n|Location=[[Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]]\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=70,213\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Pittsburgh===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Pittsburgh\n|V1= 0|V2=0 |V3= 3|V4=7\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1= 7|H2=16 |H3=7 |H4=16\n|Date=September 20\n|Location=Oklahoma Memorial Stadium\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Miami (FL)===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Oklahoma\n|V1=0 |V2= 20|V3= 0|V4=0\n|Host=Miami (FL)\n|H1=7 |H2= 0|H3=0 |H4=10\n|Date=September 26\n|Location=[[Orange Bowl (stadium)|Orange Bowl]]\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=39,020\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Colorado===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Colorado\n|V1= 0|V2=7 |V3= 7|V4=6\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1=7 |H2= 7|H3=7 |H4=0\n|Date=October 4\n|Location=Oklahoma Memorial Stadium\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=71,118\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Washington 11 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 7\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Washington 74 yard punt return (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 14\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time= |Team=COL |Event=Waddy 3 yard run (Mackenzie kick) |Score=OKLA 14\u20137 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter= Q3|Time= |Team=COL |Event=Williams 1 yard run (Mackenzie kick) |Score=Tie 14\u201314 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter= Q3|Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Peacock 2 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 21\u201314 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter= Q4 |Time=1:23 |Team=COL |Event=Waddy 8 yard pass from Williams (kick failed) |Score=OKLA 21\u201320 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n<ref>Eugene Register-Guard. 1975 Oct 5.

The fearsome runner had trampled everything in his path en route to 508 yards (8.1 ypc), including 198 yards against [[1975 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]].  Behind the young Campbell, the Longhorns were leading the nation in rushing, total offense and scoring, averaging 44 points per game.\n\nThe Sooners had a leader in [[Steve Davis (quarterback)|Steve Davis]], an ordained minister that could run and pass.  The halfbacks, Joe Washington and Horace Ivory were speedy and elusive.  The receiving corps, paced by Senior Billy Brooks, was among the best of the wishbone era at OU.  Of course, the greatest asset to the Sooners was not on offense.  The 1975 OU defense was among the very best in a storied history, led by [[Lee Roy Selmon]], who would go on to win both the [[Outland Trophy]] and the [[Lombardi Award]] as the nation's best lineman.\n\nIt was the Sooner defense that made the Longhorns lose a fifth straight Red River Shootout.  Neither offense exploded with big plays, both scoring hard fought points in the red zone.  The game was best characterized by the hard hitting from both sides, which led to a considerable number of turnovers.  The Longhorns fumbled the ball four times and gave away an interception.  The Sooners lost two fumbles.  The Sooner defense proved its mettle against the powerful Campbell, holding him to 95 yards on 23 carries.  Although he was the game's leading ball carrier, he also marked the 21st straight time that a team failed to have a 100&ndash;yard rusher against the Sooners.

Inexplicably, a team that had run roughshod over equivalent teams, managed to suffer a 23&ndash;3 loss to unranked Kansas, a team that came into Norman with a 5&ndash;3 record.  The Sooners were caught flat and were upset by the Jayhawks, knocking them from the #2 spot in the polls down to #7.  In Columbia against #18 Missouri the following week, they needed a 71&ndash;yard touchdown run from Joe Washington on a critical fourth and one, a Washington run for a successful two&ndash;point conversion, and two missed field goal attempts by the Tigers in the final two minutes to eke out a 28&ndash;27 win.  The struggles took their toll, and OU found themselves down another spot in the poll heading into the annual showdown against Nebraska.  The defending national champs were reeling and in search of an identity.  No game could have had nearly as much on the line as the final regular season game for the Big 8 Championship.<ref name=\"1975 OU Season \u2013 November Nightmare\">{{cite web|url=http://soonerstats.com/football/games/recap.cfm?GameID=737|title=November Nightmare|publisher=Soonerstats.com|year=2007|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Oklahoma State===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Oklahoma\n|V1= 10|V2=0 |V3=10 |V4=7\n|Host=Oklahoma St\n|H1= 0|H2=0 |H3=0 |H4=7\n|Date=November 1\n|Location=[[Lewis Field]]\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=49,358\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Kansas===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Kansas\n|V1=0 |V2= 7|V3=9 |V4=7\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1=3 |H2=0 |H3=0 |H4=0\n|Date=November 8\n|Location=Oklahoma Memorial Stadium\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=70,922\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Missouri===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Oklahoma\n|V1=12 |V2=8 |V3=0 |V4=8\n|Host=Missouri\n|H1=0 |H2=0 |H3= 7|H4=20\n|Date=November 15\n|Location=[[Faurot Field|Memorial Stadium]]\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=67,518\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Nebraska===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=#2 Nebraska at #7 Oklahoma\n|Visitor=Nebraska\n|V1= 3|V2=0 |V3= 7|V4=0\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1=0 |H2=7 |H3=7 |H4=21\n|Date=November 22\n|Location=Oklahoma Memorial Stadium\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=70,286\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=<!--NONE (Oklahoma banned from television due to NCAA probation)-->\n}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter= Q1|Time= |Team= NEB|Event=Coyle 24 yard field goal |Score=NEB 3-0}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time= |Team= OKLA|Event=[[Steve Davis (quarterback)|Davis]] 1 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 7-3}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= Q3|Time= |Team=NEB |Event=Anthony 1 yard run (Coyle kick) |Score=NEB 10-7 }}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Ivory 5 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 14-10}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Peacock 3 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 21-10}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry  |Quarter=Q4 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Davis 8 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score= OKLA 28-10}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=[[Billy Sims|Sims]] 4 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score= OKLA 35-10|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=4pF9x-cDGsoC&dat=19751123&printsec=frontpage&hl=en \"Oklahoma rides fumbles to Miami.\" Eugene Register-Guard. November 23, 1975]</ref>\n\nNebraska began 1975 mostly under the radar, but they were riding a 10-0 record and sporting one of the best passing quarterbacks in the nation in Vince Ferragamo, who had transferred a season before from California.  He had completed 66 of 109 passes for 1,007 yards and 12 touchdowns, against only two interceptions. The Huskers had stepped into the #2 spot in the polls that the Sooners had vacated in their loss to Kansas.\n\nThe Cornhusker offense was balanced, averaging 265.6 yards rushing and 156.7 yards passing per game, and was among the nation's leaders in scoring, averaging 34.3 points per game.  The Nebraska defense was allowing only 8.5 points per game. They had posted four shutouts, including their last two opponents to run their string to ten consecutive scoreless quarters. The Black Shirt D had held the same Jayhawks team that had upset OU earlier in the season to only 177 yards of total offense.\n\nThe Big Eight title, as usual, was on the line in 1975. The winner would play in the Orange Bowl with a possible shot at a national championship. Oklahoma, realizing all that was on the line, had worked with Fiesta Bowl officials for a potential bid in Tempe if they lost to the Cornhuskers.  Nebraska had shunned the Fiesta officials, possibly shutting themselves out of the bowls in the event of a loss.\n\nUltimately, the Sooners came out of Norman with the conference title and the shot at a national title in the Orange Bowl, and it turned out to not even be close. Three turnovers in the fourth quarter had ended the Huskers' chances.  Oklahoma scored on all three to make it five touchdowns from six Nebraska turnovers. The Sooners came away with a convincing and incredible 25-point victory over the second-ranked team in the land.\n\nOnce again, it was the Oklahoma defense that made the big plays when they needed to and controlled the Nebraska offense, limiting them to 245 total yards, only 70 on the ground. Ferragamo, who came into the game with high expectations, had completed 13 of his 25 passes for 146 yards.  His four turnovers, however, had spoiled the game for Nebraska, and Oklahoma was on its way to face Michigan in the 1976 Orange Bowl.<ref name=\"1975 OU-Nebraska Game\">{{cite web|url=http://soonerstats.com/football/games/recap.cfm?GameID=737|title=OU-Nebraska Game 1975|publisher=Soonerstats.com|year=2007|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Orange Bowl===\n{{Main|1976 Orange Bowl}}\n{{Seealso|1975 Michigan Wolverines football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegeSecondaryStyle|Oklahoma Sooners|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=Orange Bowl: #4 Michigan Wolverines vs. #2 Oklahoma Sooners (10\u20131)\n|date={{tooltip|January 1, 1976|Thursday}}\n|time=\n|road=[[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]]\n|R1=0 |R2= 0|R3=0 |R4=6\n|home='''[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]'''\n|H1=0 |H2=7 |H3=0 |H4=7\n|stadium=[[Orange Bowl (stadium)|Orange Bowl]], [[Miami, Florida]]\n|attendance=76,799\n|weather=\n|referee=\n|TV=[[College Football on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]] and [[John Brodie]]\n|reference=[https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/bowls/1976orng.htm Recap/Box]\n|scoring=\n'''Second quarter'''\n*OU \u2013 [[Billy Brooks]] 39-yard run (Tony DiRienzo kick).

summaries==\nOklahoma had won the AP National Title in 1974 and began the year by thrashing Oregon 62-7 in Norman.  OU played host to a [[Johnny Majors]] coached #15 Pittsburgh squad, sporting junior running back sensation [[Tony Dorsett]] (only a year away from the [[Heisman trophy]] and the collegiate rushing record), and they dominated, outscoring the Panthers 46&ndash;10. But a trip to unranked Miami was nearly fatal.  The Sooners scored all 20 of their points in the second quarter and finished with just 163 rushing yards and 176 total, barely surviving a ten&ndash;point Hurricanes' fourth quarter en route to a 20&ndash;17 victory. That win was not enough to knock the Sooners to the second spot in the polls, but a one-point win over Colorado the following week was. Against the Buffaloes, the vaunted Sooner wishbone offense looked abysmal, and they surrendered a 14&ndash;point lead in the second half. A botched CU extra point in the final 79 seconds proved the difference. [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] took over the number one ranking. The Sooners, despite the close calls, came into Dallas atop a 24&ndash;game winning streak and a 33-game unbeaten streak and ranked #2 in the country.<ref name=\"1975 Oklahoma Season\">{{cite web|url=http://soonerstats.com/football/games/recap.cfm?GameID=731|title=Beginning of Oklahoma Sooners 1975 Football Season|publisher=Soonerstats.com|year=2007|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Oregon===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Oregon\n|V1=7 |V2=0 |V3=0 |V4=0\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1=10 |H2=33 |H3= 7|H4=12\n|Date=September 13\n|Location=[[Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]]\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=70,213\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Pittsburgh===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Pittsburgh\n|V1= 0|V2=0 |V3= 3|V4=7\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1= 7|H2=16 |H3=7 |H4=16\n|Date=September 20\n|Location=Oklahoma Memorial Stadium\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Miami (FL)===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Oklahoma\n|V1=0 |V2= 20|V3= 0|V4=0\n|Host=Miami (FL)\n|H1=7 |H2= 0|H3=0 |H4=10\n|Date=September 26\n|Location=[[Orange Bowl (stadium)|Orange Bowl]]\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=39,020\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Colorado===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=\n|Visitor=Colorado\n|V1= 0|V2=7 |V3= 7|V4=6\n|Host=Oklahoma\n|H1=7 |H2= 7|H3=7 |H4=0\n|Date=October 4\n|Location=Oklahoma Memorial Stadium\n|StartTime=\n|TimeZone=\n|ElapsedTime=\n|Attendance=71,118\n|Weather=\n|Referee=\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Washington 11 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 7\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Washington 74 yard punt return (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 14\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time= |Team=COL |Event=Waddy 3 yard run (Mackenzie kick) |Score=OKLA 14\u20137 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter= Q3|Time= |Team=COL |Event=Williams 1 yard run (Mackenzie kick) |Score=Tie 14\u201314 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter= Q3|Time= |Team=OKLA |Event=Peacock 2 yard run (DiRienzo kick) |Score=OKLA 21\u201314 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter= Q4 |Time=1:23 |Team=COL |Event=Waddy 8 yard pass from Williams (kick failed) |Score=OKLA 21\u201320 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n<ref>Eugene Register-Guard. 1975 Oct 5.

The fearsome runner had trampled everything in his path en route to 508 yards (8.1 ypc), including 198 yards against [[1975 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]].  Behind the young Campbell, the Longhorns were leading the nation in rushing, total offense and scoring, averaging 44 points per game.\n\nThe Sooners had a leader in [[Steve Davis (quarterback)|Steve Davis]], an ordained minister that could run and pass.  The halfbacks, Joe Washington and Horace Ivory were speedy and elusive.  The receiving corps, paced by Senior Billy Brooks, was among the best of the wishbone era at OU.  Of course, the greatest asset to the Sooners was not on offense.  The 1975 OU defense was among the very best in a storied history, led by [[Lee Roy Selmon]], who would go on to win both the [[Outland Trophy]] and the [[Lombardi Award]] as the nation's best lineman.\n\nIt was the Sooner defense that made the Longhorns lose a fifth straight Red River Shootout.  Neither offense exploded with big plays, both scoring hard fought points in the red zone.  The game was best characterized by the hard hitting from both sides, which led to a considerable number of turnovers.  The Longhorns fumbled the ball four times and gave away an interception.  The Sooners lost two fumbles.  The Sooner defense proved its mettle against the powerful Campbell, holding him to 95 yards on 23 carries.  Although he was the game's leading ball carrier, he also marked the 21st straight time that a team failed to have a 100&ndash;yard rusher against the Sooners.

Inexplicably, a team that had run roughshod over equivalent teams, managed to suffer a 23&ndash;3 loss to unranked Kansas, a team that came into Norman with a 5&ndash;3 record.  The Sooners were caught flat and were upset by the Jayhawks, knocking them from the #2 spot in the polls down to #7.  In Columbia against #18 Missouri the following week, they needed a 71&ndash;yard touchdown run from Joe Washington on a critical fourth and one, a Washington run for a successful two&ndash;point conversion, and two missed field goal attempts by the Tigers in the final two minutes to eke out a 28&ndash;27 win.  The struggles took their toll, and OU found themselves down another spot in the poll heading into the annual showdown against Nebraska.  The defending national champs were reeling and in search of an identity.

He had completed 66 of 109 passes for 1,007 yards and 12 touchdowns, against only two interceptions. The Huskers had stepped into the #2 spot in the polls that the Sooners had vacated in their loss to Kansas.\n\nThe Cornhusker offense was balanced, averaging 265.6 yards rushing and 156.7 yards passing per game, and was among the nation's leaders in scoring, averaging 34.3 points per game.  The Nebraska defense was allowing only 8.5 points per game. They had posted four shutouts, including their last two opponents to run their string to ten consecutive scoreless quarters. The Black Shirt D had held the same Jayhawks team that had upset OU earlier in the season to only 177 yards of total offense.\n\nThe Big Eight title, as usual, was on the line in 1975. The winner would play in the Orange Bowl with a possible shot at a national championship. Oklahoma, realizing all that was on the line, had worked with Fiesta Bowl officials for a potential bid in Tempe if they lost to the Cornhuskers.  Nebraska had shunned the Fiesta officials, possibly shutting themselves out of the bowls in the event of a loss.\n\nUltimately, the Sooners came out of Norman with the conference title and the shot at a national title in the Orange Bowl, and it turned out to not even be close. Three turnovers in the fourth quarter had ended the Huskers' chances.  Oklahoma scored on all three to make it five touchdowns from six Nebraska turnovers. The Sooners came away with a convincing and incredible 25-point victory over the second-ranked team in the land.\n\nOnce again, it was the Oklahoma defense that made the big plays when they needed to and controlled the Nebraska offense, limiting them to 245 total yards, only 70 on the ground. Ferragamo, who came into the game with high expectations, had completed 13 of his 25 passes for 146 yards.  His four turnovers, however, had spoiled the game for Nebraska, and Oklahoma was on its way to face Michigan in the 1976 Orange Bowl.<ref name=\"1975 OU-Nebraska Game\">{{cite web|url=http://soonerstats.com/football/games/recap.cfm?GameID=737|title=OU-Nebraska Game 1975|publisher=Soonerstats.com|year=2007|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Orange Bowl===\n{{Main|1976 Orange Bowl}}\n{{Seealso|1975 Michigan Wolverines football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=\n|bg2=\n|titlestyle={{CollegeSecondaryStyle|Oklahoma Sooners|border=2}}; text-align:center\n|state=collapsed\n|title=Orange Bowl: #4 Michigan Wolverines vs. #2 Oklahoma Sooners (10\u20131)\n|date={{tooltip|January 1, 1976|Thursday}}\n|time=\n|road=[[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]]\n|R1=0 |R2= 0|R3=0 |R4=6\n|home='''[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]'''\n|H1=0 |H2=7 |H3=0 |H4=7\n|stadium=[[Orange Bowl (stadium)|Orange Bowl]], [[Miami, Florida]]\n|attendance=76,799\n|weather=\n|referee=\n|TV=[[College Football on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]] and [[John Brodie]]\n|reference=[https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/bowls/1976orng.htm Recap/Box]\n|scoring=\n'''Second quarter'''\n*OU \u2013 [[Billy Brooks]] 39-yard run (Tony DiRienzo kick).

In general, in most countries, there are no laws which prescribe what clothing is required to be worn. However, the community standards of clothing are set indirectly by way of prosecution of those who wear something that is not socially approved. Those people who wear insufficient clothing can be prosecuted in many countries under various offences termed [[indecent exposure]], public indecency or other descriptions. Generally, these offences do not themselves define what is and what is not acceptable clothing to constitute the offence, and leave it to a judge to determine in each case.\n\nMost clothing laws concern which parts of the body must ''not'' be exposed to view; there are exceptions. Some countries have strict clothing laws, such as in some [[Islamic]] countries. Other countries are more tolerant of non-conventional attire and are relaxed about nudity.  Many countries have different laws and customs for men and women, what may be allowed or perceived often varies by gender.<ref Name=\"Kirby\">{{cite book\n  | last =Kirby\n  | first =Kathleen M. \n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Indifferent boundaries: spatial concepts of human subjectivity\n  | publisher =Guilford Press\n  | year =1996\n  | location =\n  | url =https://books.google.com/?id=Y4PcShmKe-YC&pg=PA132&dq=different+laws+for+men+and+women,+public+nudity+is+legal+on+most+beaches#PPA124,M1\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-89862-572-6\n\n  | page = Chapter 5 }}</ref>\n\nSeparate laws are usually in place to regulate [[obscenity]], which includes certain depictions of people in various states of undress, and [[child pornography]], which may include similar photographs of children.\n\nIn some countries, non-sexual toplessness or nudity is legal. However, private or public establishments can establish a [[dress code]] which requires visitors to wear prescribed clothing.\n\nThere are a variety of laws around the world which affect what people can and cannot wear. For example, some laws require a person in authority to wear the appropriate uniform. For example, a police officer on duty may be required to wear a uniform; and it can be illegal for the general public to wear a police officer's uniform. The same could apply to firefighters and other emergency personnel. In some countries, for example in Australia, the [[Scouts Australia|boy scouts]] uniform is also protected.\n\nIn most [[Court|courts of law]], lawyers and judges are required by law or custom to wear [[Court Dress|court dress]], which may entail robes or traditional wigs.\n\nIn many countries, regulations require workers to wear protective clothing, such as [[safety helmet]]s, shoes, vests, etc., as appropriate. The obligation is generally on employers to ensure that their workers wear the appropriate protective clothing. Similarly, health regulations may require those who handle food to wear hair covering, gloves and other clothing.\n\nGovernments can also influence standards of dress shown on television through its licensing powers.\n\nIn addition to nude beaches and similar exceptional locations, there are some public events in which nudity is tolerated more than usual, such as the [[naked bike ride]]s held in several countries.\n\n== International laws and customs and culture ==\nThere are many specific circumstances where body parts have to be covered, often for safety or sanitary reasons.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia and Iran, women must conceal almost their entire bodies (see [[hijab]]).\n\n==Australia==\n\nIn [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area.<ref name=Lifehackerau>{{cite news|title=Is it legal to sunbathe topless in Australia?|date=Nov 30, 2015|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Chris Jager|publisher=Lifehacker|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/is-it-legal-to-sunbathe-topless/}}</ref> Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=How to Legally #FreeTheNipple in Australia|date=March 11, 2016|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Katherine Gillespie|magazine=Vice.com|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/mbv4pb/how-to-legally-freethenipple-in-australia}}</ref>\n\nOn public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbathe topless without fuss.<ref name=Lifehackerau></ref>\n\nBreastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia.

Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.<ref>''R. v. Beaupr\u00e9'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: \"mere nude sunbathing is not of sufficient moral turpitude to support a charge for doing an indecent act.\"</ref> Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.<ref>''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court</ref><ref>''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court</ref> Section 174 prohibits being \"nude\" in a public place or in public view without \"a lawful excuse\", but defines \"nude\" only as being \"so clad as to offend against public decency or order\".

According to the government\u2019s Public Prosecution Service, the attorney general\u2019s consent is needed for two reasons: to avoid the specific harm that could result from prosecuting an innocent person; and to avoid the general harm resulting from prosecuting a case that isn\u2019t in the public interest.<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://criminal.findlaw.ca/article/is-it-legal-to-be-naked-in-canada/|title=FindLaw Canada {{!}} Is it legal to be naked in Canada?|website=criminal.findlaw.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}} </ref>\n\n==Germany==\nGermany has a long history of allowing mixed sex public nudity in designated areas (e.g., beaches and parks). This was true before WW II, after WW II in both West and East Germany and currently. Some of these areas are where clothing is optional and some are where clothing is forbidden (i.e., mandatory nudity). In non-designated areas, appearing nude in public \"counts as a minor breach of the law.

Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves.

Although nudity has gradually been tolerated on [[Sandy Bay, Cape Town|Sandy Bay]] in [[Cape Town]] after the National Party (NP) lost the election in 1994, and strict enforcement of its moral values is no longer applied, it is not an official legally recognised public nude beach. Partial nudity is also tolerated on other beaches.\n\n==United Arab Emirates==\nSince 2008, the municipality of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] has ensured that signs are posted on beaches warning women against topless bathing and indecent exposure contrary to the cultural values of the UAE. There is no fine for breaking this rule, however a warning is issued and if necessary, ejection from the beach. This was said to be in response to residents' complaints about tourists sunbathing topless or nude and changing their clothes in public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubai-takes-action-on-indecent-sunbathing|title=Dubai takes action on 'indecent' sunbathing|website=Thenational.ae|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are also signs at malls and shopping centers that advocates modest clothing which indicates that shoulders and knees must be covered, and public nudity is against the law.

There are a further three jurisdictions that are [[Crown dependencies]] ([[Isle of Man]], [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and [[Bailiwick of Jersey]]). The details of the law regarding [[public nudity]] differ substantially between them.

In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present.  In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception.  There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having [[sexual intercourse in public]], or publicly [[caressing]] someone in a sexual way.  In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably [[erection|erect]] penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing.  In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act.  In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances.

On the other hand, naked jogging or naked cycling have been considered in certain circumstances as public nuisance by several courts.<br>\nNote: The German Penal Code determines \"exhibitionism\" (sec. 183) as an act of public exposure committed by a man for sexual arrousal and \"causing a public disturbance\" (sec. 183a) as a sexual activity in public. Therefore, non-sexual nudity is not considered as crime or misdemeanour.\n|Section 118 of the Act on Regulatory Offences: \"(1) Whoever commits a grossly offensive act which is apt to disturb or endanger the public and to prejudice public order shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.<br>\n(2) The regulatory offence may be sanctioned by a regulatory fine unless the act may be sanctioned pursuant to other provisions.\"<br>\nThe regulatory fine is between 5 and 1.000 Euros (sec. 17 (2) of the act).

In general, in most countries, there are no laws which prescribe what clothing is required to be worn. However, the community standards of clothing are set indirectly by way of prosecution of those who wear something that is not socially approved. Those people who wear insufficient clothing can be prosecuted in many countries under various offences termed [[indecent exposure]], public indecency or other descriptions. Generally, these offences do not themselves define what is and what is not acceptable clothing to constitute the offence, and leave it to a judge to determine in each case.\n\nMost clothing laws concern which parts of the body must ''not'' be exposed to view; there are exceptions. Some countries have strict clothing laws, such as in some [[Islamic]] countries. Other countries are more tolerant of non-conventional attire and are relaxed about nudity.  Many countries have different laws and customs for men and women, what may be allowed or perceived often varies by gender.<ref Name=\"Kirby\">{{cite book\n  | last =Kirby\n  | first =Kathleen M. \n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Indifferent boundaries: spatial concepts of human subjectivity\n  | publisher =Guilford Press\n  | year =1996\n  | location =\n  | url =https://books.google.com/?id=Y4PcShmKe-YC&pg=PA132&dq=different+laws+for+men+and+women,+public+nudity+is+legal+on+most+beaches#PPA124,M1\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-89862-572-6\n\n  | page = Chapter 5 }}</ref>\n\nSeparate laws are usually in place to regulate [[obscenity]], which includes certain depictions of people in various states of undress, and [[child pornography]], which may include similar photographs of children.\n\nIn some countries, non-sexual toplessness or nudity is legal. However, private or public establishments can establish a [[dress code]] which requires visitors to wear prescribed clothing.\n\nThere are a variety of laws around the world which affect what people can and cannot wear. For example, some laws require a person in authority to wear the appropriate uniform. For example, a police officer on duty may be required to wear a uniform; and it can be illegal for the general public to wear a police officer's uniform. The same could apply to firefighters and other emergency personnel. In some countries, for example in Australia, the [[Scouts Australia|boy scouts]] uniform is also protected.\n\nIn most [[Court|courts of law]], lawyers and judges are required by law or custom to wear [[Court Dress|court dress]], which may entail robes or traditional wigs.\n\nIn many countries, regulations require workers to wear protective clothing, such as [[safety helmet]]s, shoes, vests, etc., as appropriate. The obligation is generally on employers to ensure that their workers wear the appropriate protective clothing. Similarly, health regulations may require those who handle food to wear hair covering, gloves and other clothing.\n\nGovernments can also influence standards of dress shown on television through its licensing powers.\n\nIn addition to nude beaches and similar exceptional locations, there are some public events in which nudity is tolerated more than usual, such as the [[naked bike ride]]s held in several countries.\n\n== International laws and customs and culture ==\nThere are many specific circumstances where body parts have to be covered, often for safety or sanitary reasons.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia and Iran, women must conceal almost their entire bodies (see [[hijab]]).\n\n==Australia==\n\nIn [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area.<ref name=Lifehackerau>{{cite news|title=Is it legal to sunbathe topless in Australia?|date=Nov 30, 2015|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Chris Jager|publisher=Lifehacker|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/is-it-legal-to-sunbathe-topless/}}</ref> Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=How to Legally #FreeTheNipple in Australia|date=March 11, 2016|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Katherine Gillespie|magazine=Vice.com|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/mbv4pb/how-to-legally-freethenipple-in-australia}}</ref>\n\nOn public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbathe topless without fuss.<ref name=Lifehackerau></ref>\n\nBreastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia.

According to the government\u2019s Public Prosecution Service, the attorney general\u2019s consent is needed for two reasons: to avoid the specific harm that could result from prosecuting an innocent person; and to avoid the general harm resulting from prosecuting a case that isn\u2019t in the public interest.<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://criminal.findlaw.ca/article/is-it-legal-to-be-naked-in-canada/|title=FindLaw Canada {{!}} Is it legal to be naked in Canada?|website=criminal.findlaw.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}} </ref>\n\n==Germany==\nGermany has a long history of allowing mixed sex public nudity in designated areas (e.g., beaches and parks).

Partial nudity is also tolerated on other beaches.\n\n==United Arab Emirates==\nSince 2008, the municipality of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] has ensured that signs are posted on beaches warning women against topless bathing and indecent exposure contrary to the cultural values of the UAE. There is no fine for breaking this rule, however a warning is issued and if necessary, ejection from the beach.

In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present.  In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception.  There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having [[sexual intercourse in public]], or publicly [[caressing]] someone in a sexual way.  In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably [[erection|erect]] penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing.  In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act.  In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances. In most states, there is a governing state statute which defines the offense; in Maryland and Massachusetts, indecency is defined by [[case law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/state_laws.htm|title=Naturist State Laws|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>  Some local (county and municipal) governments also regulate personal exposure, as well as commercial activities such as [[strip club]]s.\n\nCase law in general governs the interpretation of the statutory definition, and in some cases allows for additional exceptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/us_district_courts.html|title=US District Courts|first=Robert|last=Morton|website=Naturisteducation.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/Court%20Cases.htm#List%20of%20Cases|title=Nudist Court Cases<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn general, exposure of the head, upper chest, and limbs is legal, and considered socially acceptable except among certain religious communities.\n\nFederal, state, and local regulations for certain occupations require various pieces of protective clothing for the safety of the wearer.  Such items include [[hard hat]]s, safety [[vest]]s, life jackets, [[apron]]s, [[hairnet]]s, and [[steel-toe boots]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear ([[sagging (fashion)|sagging]]). The practice was banned in some places.\n\nSome states and towns have loose, or no, regulations for requiring clothing. The city of San Francisco has a history of [[Social nudity in San Francisco|public nudity]], including at public events such as [[Bay to Breakers]]. The town of [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], [[Vermont|VT]], experienced a brief period during which there was public nudity, until a law was passed banning it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brattleborochamber.org/one-and-only|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315061920/http://brattleborochamber.org/one-and-only|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 March 2013|title=The One and Only - Brattleboro Vermont|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Summary of various countries ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\" | Attire laws\n! scope=\"col\" | Maximum penalty\n|-\n|France\n|Chest and private parts must be covered except near bathing zones. [[Burqa]] banned.\n|article 222-32: \"Publicly visible sexual exhibition in public zones\" punishable by 1 year of imprisonment and 15,000 fine.\n|-\n|Germany\n|There are no explicit legal regulations on clothing in Germany. Nudity on private grounds is considered as legal even if visible from outside. The same applies for naked sunbathing as long as not otherwise stated by local laws. On the other hand, naked jogging or naked cycling have been considered in certain circumstances as public nuisance by several courts.<br>\nNote: The German Penal Code determines \"exhibitionism\" (sec. 183) as an act of public exposure committed by a man for sexual arrousal and \"causing a public disturbance\" (sec. 183a) as a sexual activity in public. Therefore, non-sexual nudity is not considered as crime or misdemeanour.\n|Section 118 of the Act on Regulatory Offences: \"(1) Whoever commits a grossly offensive act which is apt to disturb or endanger the public and to prejudice public order shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.<br>\n(2) The regulatory offence may be sanctioned by a regulatory fine unless the act may be sanctioned pursuant to other provisions.\"<br>\nThe regulatory fine is between 5 and 1.000 Euros (sec. 17 (2) of the act). More likely, the local or state police may politely demand to cover up without further sanction or a cautionary fine of 5 to 55 Euros if immediately obeyed (sec. 56 (1) of the act).\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|Nude recreation in the Netherlands has been described in article 430a of the criminal law. The city council can designate public places found suitable for nude recreation. Nude recreation in such places is always allowed. This does however not mean it is forbidden everywhere outside these designated places. It is only disallowed in places accessible to the general public found unsuitable for nude recreation. Whether a place is suitable or not is decided by the judge, not by the government. There have been a number of law cases about this, so jurisprudence is available. In general most places have been found suitable.\n|A fine of the first category (maximum \u20ac 410,-).\n|-\n|Spain\n|Spanish law does not have any article that prohibits public nudity, it is therefore always allowed.
