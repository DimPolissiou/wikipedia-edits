After working at Le Gavroche for a year, Albert Roux invited Ramsay to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the [[French Alps]], as his number two. From there, a 23-year-old Ramsay moved to Paris to work with [[Guy Savoy (chef)|Guy Savoy]] and [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], both [[Michelin star|Michelin-starred]] chefs. In ''Master Chef'' series 3 episode 18, Gordon Ramsay stated that Guy Savoy was his mentor.

The restaurant was renamed [[Aubergine (London restaurant)|Aubergine]] and went on to win its first [[Michelin star]] fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/style/chefs-walkoutwith-staff-sets-london-abroil.html |last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> He has described the decision to set out on his own as \"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life\".<ref>''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares'' episode \"Rococo\" (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, [[Restaurant Gordon Ramsay]], with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat.<ref name=\"Chef Trouble\">{{cite news | title=Gordon Ramsay: Chef terrible |work=BBC News World Edition | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448742.stm |accessdate=1 August 2006 | date=20 July 2001}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The Good Food Guide]]'' listed Restaurant Gordon Ramsay as the second best in the UK, only bettered by [[The Fat Duck]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Good Food Guide's Top 60 UK Restaurants AnnouNced|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/news/the-good-food-guides-top-60-uk-restaurants-announced|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The Good Food Guide}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay's empire expanded rapidly.

He said, \"I thought I was a goner\". He reached the surface of the water by removing his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. His film crew, who rescued Ramsay by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds.

It was also revealed that three of his [[gastropub]]s in London did the same thing. A spokeswoman for Gordon Ramsay explained, \"Gordon Ramsay chefs prepare components of dishes devised and produced to the highest Gordon Ramsay standards. These are supplied to those kitchens with limited cooking space such as Foxtrot Oscar and Gordon Ramsay's highly acclaimed pubs, including the Narrow. These are sealed and transported daily in refrigerated vans and all menu dishes are then cooked in the individual kitchens.

The restaurant was renamed [[Aubergine (London restaurant)|Aubergine]] and went on to win its first [[Michelin star]] fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/style/chefs-walkoutwith-staff-sets-london-abroil.html |last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> He has described the decision to set out on his own as \"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life\".<ref>''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares'' episode \"Rococo\" (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, [[Restaurant Gordon Ramsay]], with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat.<ref name=\"Chef Trouble\">{{cite news | title=Gordon Ramsay: Chef terrible |work=BBC News World Edition | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448742.stm |accessdate=1 August 2006 | date=20 July 2001}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The Good Food Guide]]'' listed Restaurant Gordon Ramsay as the second best in the UK, only bettered by [[The Fat Duck]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Good Food Guide's Top 60 UK Restaurants AnnouNced|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/news/the-good-food-guides-top-60-uk-restaurants-announced|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The Good Food Guide}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay's empire expanded rapidly.

He said, \"I thought I was a goner\". He reached the surface of the water by removing his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. His film crew, who rescued Ramsay by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds. During the ordeal, he remembers how he felt: \"I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water. When I got to the top after getting my boots off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com/article.aspx?id=604768 |title=I thought I would die: Gordon Ramsay |publisher=Nine MSN |accessdate=16 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123182100/http://news.ninemsn.com/article.aspx?id=604768 |archivedate=23 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-prepared meal controversy===\nOn 17 April 2009, it was revealed that one of Ramsay's restaurants, Foxtrot Oscar in Chelsea, West London, used pre-prepared food that was heated up and sold with mark-ups of up to 586%. It was also revealed that three of his [[gastropub]]s in London did the same thing. A spokeswoman for Gordon Ramsay explained, \"Gordon Ramsay chefs prepare components of dishes devised and produced to the highest Gordon Ramsay standards. These are supplied to those kitchens with limited cooking space such as Foxtrot Oscar and Gordon Ramsay's highly acclaimed pubs, including the Narrow. These are sealed and transported daily in refrigerated vans and all menu dishes are then cooked in the individual kitchens. This is only for the supply of Foxtrot Oscar and the three pubs and allows each establishment to control the consistency and the quality of the food served\".<ref name=newsscotsmancom>{{cite news|last=Brown |first=Craig |url= http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Ramsay39s-new-Fword-frozen-ready.5182757.jp |title=Ramsay's new F-word: frozen ready meals served up at celebrity prices |publisher=Press Association/TV.com |date= 18 April 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/gordon-ramsay-defends-prepared-food/story/14021.html |title=Gordon Ramsay defends prepared food |publisher=TV.com |date=19 April 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013164610/http://www.tv.com/gordon-ramsay-defends-prepared-food/story/14021.html |archivedate=13 October 2010 }}</ref> Reflecting on the controversy in 2010, Ramsay was unapologetic, stating: {{quote|When I was working at the Gavroche all those years ago, the duck terrine wasn't made there.

Many rich Turks and Jews lived there, together with Ottoman refugees, such as Turks and Albanians from Vardounia (\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1) driven there by the outbreak of the revolt, escaping massacres in the country's southern districts.<ref name=Andromedas/><ref>St. Clair, p. 45.</ref>\n\nIt was also a potent symbol for revenge, its Greek population having been [[List of events named massacres|massacre]]d by the Ottoman forces in the past: the latest of such events, a few months earlier, following the [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792-1828)#Campaign in Moldavia and Wallachia|failed rebellion at Moldavia]] in early 1821; previous massacres of the town's Greeks occurred in 1715 (during the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Ottoman reconquest of the Morea]]) and on [[Holy Monday]], 29 March 1770, after the failed [[Orlov Revolt]].<ref>Nafziger, George F. and Mark W.

He set up fortified camps in the surrounding places, establishing several headquarters under the command of his captain [[Anagnostaras]] in the nearby villages, notably Zarachova, [[Piana Arkadia|Piana]], [[Dimitsana]] and [[Stemnitsa]], where local peasants provided his men with food and supplies.<ref>Kolokotronis, p. 82.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a fresh  and compact force of [[Maniots|Maniot]] troops under [[Petros Mavromichalis]], the [[Bey#Beys elsewhere|Bey of Mani]], arrived and camped at [[Valtetsi (village)|Valtetsi]] so as to take part in the final assault to the Ottoman capital of [[Morea]].<ref name=\"Stratiki, p. 83\">Stratiki, p. 83.</ref> [[Arvanites]] were present alongside Greek revolutionaries during the siege, in fighting and the massacre that followed.<ref name=Heraclides/>\n\nThe Ottoman (Turkish and Albanian) garrison was reinforced in May by some troops and cavalry sent by [[Hursid Pasha]] from the north, led by the Kehayabey Mustafa.\n\nThe rebels' decisive victory in the [[Battle of Valtetsi]] and several other victorious clashes such as those in [[Battle of Doliana|Doliana]] and Vervena, meant that the Greek revolutionaries had effective control over the majority of the areas in the Central and Southern Peloponnese.\n\n==Siege==\nAlthough the siege had been going on for several months, its progress was slow, as the Greeks were unable to maintain a tight blockade and were often scattered by sorties of Turkish cavalry.<ref name=\"St. Clair, p. 43\">St. Clair, p. 43.</ref> While during the early stages of the siege, the Ottoman garrison could sortie and forage for supplies, after the [[Battle of the Trench (1821)|Battle of the Trench]] in August this was no longer possible, and the blockade became much more tight.\n\nConditions were worsening inside the walls for scarcity of food and potable water. Taking advantage of this, Kolokotronis began quiet negotiations with the leaders of the besieged, aiming at an orderly capitulation. He wisely convinced the Albanian contingent led by Elmas Bey<ref>Finlay, p. 266</ref> to make a separate agreement for safe passage to [[Argos]], thereby greatly reducing the strength of the defenders. The deal itself was [[surety|guaranteed]] by [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], the renowned ''Koliopoulos''. The city was taken before the 2,500 Albanian had departed, but still they had a safe passage out of the Peloponnese a few days after the fall.<ref name=\"Kolokotronis, p. 89\">Kolokotronis, p. 89.</ref>\n\nGreek leaders were in constant contact with the Ottoman defenders in negotiations, but without much coordination. The successive petitions of the remaining Ottoman defenders for a truce were, in the end, regarded by the besiegers as a temporizing ruse, in an ultimately hopeless anticipation of Ottoman reinforcements.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} In anticipation of the fall of the city, by September 22, about 20,000 Greeks had gathered around it.<ref name=\"Kolokotronis, p. 89\"/>   On September 23, the Greek army broke in through a blind spot in the walls, and the town was completely overrun quickly.<ref>Stratiki, pp. 84\u201386.</ref> The fortified citadel in it surrendered three days later for lack of water.<ref>Finlay, p. 268.</ref>\n\n==Massacre of civilians==\n[[File:Tripolizza Phase 1 (recolored version, light).png|thumb|260px|Map showing the first phase of the Siege of Tripolitsa during the [[Greek War of Independence]].]]\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|260px|Plan of the Siege of Tripolitsa.

(1976). \"Maniot folk culture and the ethnic mosaic in the southeast Peloponnese\". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. '''268'''. (1): 200. \"In 1821, then, the ethnic mosaic of the southeastern Peloponnese (the ancient Laconia and Cynouria) consisted of Christian Tsakonians and Albanians on the east, Christian Maniats and Barduniotes, and Moslem Albanian Barduniotes in the southwest, and an ordinary Greek Christian population running between them. In 1821, with a general Greek uprising impending, rumors of a \"Russo-Frankish\" naval bombardment caused the \"Turkish\" population of the southeastern Peloponnese to seek refuge in the fortresses of Monevasia, Mystra, and Tripolitza. Indeed, the Turkobarduniotes were so panic stricken that they stampeded the Moslems of Mystra along with them into headlong flight to Tripolitza. The origin of this rumor was the firing of a salute by a sea captain named Frangias in honor of a Maniat leader known as \"the Russian Knight.\" Some Moslems in Bardunia, and elsewhere, remained as converts to Christianity. Thus almost overnight the whole of the southeastern Peloponnese was cleared of \"Turks\" of whatever linguistic affiliation. This situation was sealed by the ultimate success of the Greek War for Independence. The Christian Albanians, identifying with their Orthodox coreligionists and with the new nationstate, gradually gave up the Albanian language, in some instances deliberately deciding not to pass it on to their children.\"</ref><ref name=Heraclides>Heraclides, Alexis (2011).

The London School of Economics and Political Science. p. 15. \"On the Greek side, a case in point is the atrocious onslaught of the Greeks and Hellenised Christian Albanians against the city of Tripolitza in October 1821, which is justified by the Greeks ever since as the almost natural and predictable outcome of more than '400 years of slavery and dudgeon'. All the other similar atrocious acts all over Peloponnese, where apparently the whole population of Muslims (Albanian and Turkish-speakers), well over twenty thousand vanished from the face of the earth within a spat of a few months in 1821 is unsaid and forgotten, a case of ethnic cleansing through sheer slaughter (St Clair 2008: 1\u20139, 41\u201346) as are the atrocities committed in Moldavia (were the \"Greek Revolution\" actually started in February 1821) by prince Ypsilantis.\"</ref>  The total number of Muslims killed during the sack was estimated by [[Thomas Gordon (British Army officer)|Thomas Gordon]], who arrived in the city shortly after its fall, at 8,000.<ref>Finlay, p. 269.</ref> Beyond the 2,500 Albanian troops vouched for in advance; a tiny contingent of Turkish cavalry escaping to [[Nafplio|Nauplion]]; a few women who were taken as slaves; along with the harem of Hurshid Pasha; and a few notable Turks held for ransom were spared.<ref>Finlay, p. 269</ref>\n\nDescribing the massacres that occurred following the capture of Tripolitsa, historian [[Walter Alison Phillips|W. Alison Phillips]] noted that:\n\n<blockquote>For three days the miserable inhabitants were given over to lust and cruelty of a mob of savages. Neither sex nor age was spared.

Many rich Turks and Jews lived there, together with Ottoman refugees, such as Turks and Albanians from Vardounia (\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1) driven there by the outbreak of the revolt, escaping massacres in the country's southern districts.<ref name=Andromedas/><ref>St. Clair, p. 45.</ref>\n\nIt was also a potent symbol for revenge, its Greek population having been [[List of events named massacres|massacre]]d by the Ottoman forces in the past: the latest of such events, a few months earlier, following the [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792-1828)#Campaign in Moldavia and Wallachia|failed rebellion at Moldavia]] in early 1821; previous massacres of the town's Greeks occurred in 1715 (during the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Ottoman reconquest of the Morea]]) and on [[Holy Monday]], 29 March 1770, after the failed [[Orlov Revolt]].<ref>Nafziger, George F. and Mark W.

He set up fortified camps in the surrounding places, establishing several headquarters under the command of his captain [[Anagnostaras]] in the nearby villages, notably Zarachova, [[Piana Arkadia|Piana]], [[Dimitsana]] and [[Stemnitsa]], where local peasants provided his men with food and supplies.<ref>Kolokotronis, p. 82.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a fresh  and compact force of [[Maniots|Maniot]] troops under [[Petros Mavromichalis]], the [[Bey#Beys elsewhere|Bey of Mani]], arrived and camped at [[Valtetsi (village)|Valtetsi]] so as to take part in the final assault to the Ottoman capital of [[Morea]].<ref name=\"Stratiki, p. 83\">Stratiki, p. 83.</ref> [[Arvanites]] were present alongside Greek revolutionaries during the siege, in fighting and the massacre that followed.<ref name=Heraclides/>\n\nThe Ottoman (Turkish and Albanian) garrison was reinforced in May by some troops and cavalry sent by [[Hursid Pasha]] from the north, led by the Kehayabey Mustafa.\n\nThe rebels' decisive victory in the [[Battle of Valtetsi]] and several other victorious clashes such as those in [[Battle of Doliana|Doliana]] and Vervena, meant that the Greek revolutionaries had effective control over the majority of the areas in the Central and Southern Peloponnese.\n\n==Siege==\nAlthough the siege had been going on for several months, its progress was slow, as the Greeks were unable to maintain a tight blockade and were often scattered by sorties of Turkish cavalry.<ref name=\"St. Clair, p. 43\">St. Clair, p. 43.</ref> While during the early stages of the siege, the Ottoman garrison could sortie and forage for supplies, after the [[Battle of the Trench (1821)|Battle of the Trench]] in August this was no longer possible, and the blockade became much more tight.\n\nConditions were worsening inside the walls for scarcity of food and potable water. Taking advantage of this, Kolokotronis began quiet negotiations with the leaders of the besieged, aiming at an orderly capitulation. He wisely convinced the Albanian contingent led by Elmas Bey<ref>Finlay, p. 266</ref> to make a separate agreement for safe passage to [[Argos]], thereby greatly reducing the strength of the defenders. The deal itself was [[surety|guaranteed]] by [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], the renowned ''Koliopoulos''.

The successive petitions of the remaining Ottoman defenders for a truce were, in the end, regarded by the besiegers as a temporizing ruse, in an ultimately hopeless anticipation of Ottoman reinforcements.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} In anticipation of the fall of the city, by September 22, about 20,000 Greeks had gathered around it.<ref name=\"Kolokotronis, p. 89\"/>   On September 23, the Greek army broke in through a blind spot in the walls, and the town was completely overrun quickly.<ref>Stratiki, pp. 84\u201386.</ref> The fortified citadel in it surrendered three days later for lack of water.<ref>Finlay, p. 268.</ref>\n\n==Massacre of civilians==\n[[File:Tripolizza Phase 1 (recolored version, light).png|thumb|260px|Map showing the first phase of the Siege of Tripolitsa during the [[Greek War of Independence]].]]\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|260px|Plan of the Siege of Tripolitsa.

In 1821, with a general Greek uprising impending, rumors of a \"Russo-Frankish\" naval bombardment caused the \"Turkish\" population of the southeastern Peloponnese to seek refuge in the fortresses of Monevasia, Mystra, and Tripolitza. Indeed, the Turkobarduniotes were so panic stricken that they stampeded the Moslems of Mystra along with them into headlong flight to Tripolitza. The origin of this rumor was the firing of a salute by a sea captain named Frangias in honor of a Maniat leader known as \"the Russian Knight.\" Some Moslems in Bardunia, and elsewhere, remained as converts to Christianity. Thus almost overnight the whole of the southeastern Peloponnese was cleared of \"Turks\" of whatever linguistic affiliation. This situation was sealed by the ultimate success of the Greek War for Independence. The Christian Albanians, identifying with their Orthodox coreligionists and with the new nationstate, gradually gave up the Albanian language, in some instances deliberately deciding not to pass it on to their children.\"</ref><ref name=Heraclides>Heraclides, Alexis (2011).

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s. Many of them were participants of the [[St. Wenceslaus Church, Baltimore|St. Wenceslaus Church in Baltimore]].

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.
