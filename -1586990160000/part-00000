It is co-written by [[Semi Chellas]] and [[Matthew Weiner]], and directed by [[Phil Abraham]]. It aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States on May 27, 2012.\n\nThe episode takes place in January 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/may/29/mad-men-episode-11|title=Mad Men: Season 5, episode 11 \u2013 The Other Woman |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 29, 2012 |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |last=MacInnes |first=Paul}}</ref> Pete asks Joan to make a personal and moral sacrifice to ensure the company lands the Jaguar account. Meanwhile, the creatives work long nights to come up with the perfect pitch for the presentation. Don becomes furious after learning of the impact Megan's new profession will have on their life. Feeling unappreciated, Peggy has lunch with Freddy Rumsen, who encourages her to make a move. Peggy then meets with Ted Chaough, from rival firm CGC, and accepts an offer for chief copywriter.\n\n\"The Other Woman\" was critically acclaimed, with some critics calling it one of the best episodes of the series. [[Jon Hamm]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], and [[Christina Hendricks]] were lauded by journalists for their performances in this episode. \"The Other Woman\" was watched by 2.07 million viewers and received an adult 18\u201349 rating of 0.6, marking a slightly higher viewership than the previous episode.\n\n==Plot==\nThe SCDP [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] team discusses [[tagline]]s. Stan suggests one using the word \"mistress\", but Don reminds him the client would not want to hear that word in an advertisement and excuses himself. Peggy asks Don's approval of one of her projects but he tells her that she is in charge until Jaguar is done. She watches as a lobster lunch is delivered to the Jaguar team.\n\nKen and Pete dine with Herb Rennet, head of the Dealers Association and a member of Jaguar's selection committee. Herb suggests SCDP\u2019s competitive standing might be improved if they arrange an evening for him with Joan. Pete tells Joan about Herb's proposal. Shocked, she asks how Pete would feel if someone asked that of his wife Trudy. He asks Joan how much it would take to convince her. She replies that he \"couldn't afford it\".\n\nSubbing in for Ginsberg while he works on Jaguar, Peggy attends a conference call with [[Chevalier-Montrachet|Chevalier]] Blanc. The company wants to pull the Hard Day's Night ad but she spontaneously comes up with changing the existing ad to targeting women instead and wins the client over.\n\nPete presents Herb's proposal at a partners meeting, guaranteeing SCDP will lose the account if they do not comply. Don spurns the idea and leaves, but the remaining partners reluctantly agree to offer Joan $50,000. They decide to withhold Christmas bonuses and extend their credit line to cover the cost, unaware that Lane had already extended the credit line by $50,000 in the previous episode.\n\nDon instructs the Jaguar team to ditch the mistress concept because it is vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply that she is not in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.\n\nLane advises Joan to demand a 5% partnership stake in the company, adding that, when he thought he was essential to the future of the firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had ''already'' taken place.\n\nPete tells Trudy he wants an apartment in the city, but she refuses, telling him that his love affair with Manhattan is over and that they have not even been trying for a second child.\n\nThe next day, Megan tells Don that her audition gained her a callback for ''[[Little Murders]]'' and rehearsals begin shortly in Boston. He voices his displeasure at her being gone for three months. She accuses him of expecting her acting career to fail. When the callback does not go well, she tells him that, if she has to choose between him and the play, she would choose him, but will hate him for it. He assures her that he does not want her to fail, and they kiss.\n\nGinsberg approaches Don with a new Jaguar concept, portraying the car as an unattainable woman: \"Jaguar: At last, something beautiful you can truly own.\" Don smiles. Over lunch with Freddy Rumsen, Peggy gripes about her exclusion from Jaguar. Freddy suggests she leave SCDP and offers to help. The next day, Don presents the pitch to Jaguar. Herb smiles as Don unveils the tagline. Joan inquires of Don about the presentation.\n\nPeggy meets Ted Chaough from Cutler Gleason and Chaough to discuss job opportunities and he praises her work. She writes her job requirements, \"Copy Chief $18,000/year\", on a piece of paper and slides it across the table to him. Chaough crosses out $18,000 and writes $19,000. Peggy orders a chocolate shake.\n\nThe following day, Roger summons all the partners to his office to learn the fate of their Jaguar presentation. Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him it is not about money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was co-written by [[Semi Chellas]] and [[Matthew Weiner]], and directed by [[Phil Abraham]].<ref name=\"AMC Credits\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/episodes/season-5/the-other-woman |title=Mad Men \u2013 The Other Woman \u2013 AMC |publisher=AMCTV.com |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Weiner said in August 2012 that he intended for Peggy's departure from SCDP to be in \"The Other Woman\", which is centered on Joan: \"[the episode is] literally about the quantification and value of women in the workplace and the relationship of their sexuality to it.

[The audience is] not going to believe he could have won.\"<ref name=\"Lacob2\"/>\n\nChellas \"had this great idea, this elliptical thing, which we really loaded up with cues so that you would know at the end that Don was too late.

In this episode, that moment was Don throwing money in Peggy's face. It was a pivotal story point and didn't seem like it would be a hard beat to hit. During rehearsal when Jon Hamm threw the money at Lizzie Moss, it beaned her right between the eyes, inadvertently, but it was exactly what the scene required. Of course when we go to shoot the scene after setting the lights, Jon tosses the money at her, but it's just not eliciting the same response. Lizzie tells me it would really help her if Jon just nailed her with the cash again. It's harder than you think to have perfect aim with loose bills in your pocket when your target is {{convert|13|ft|m|0}} away.

It aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States on May 27, 2012.\n\nThe episode takes place in January 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/may/29/mad-men-episode-11|title=Mad Men: Season 5, episode 11 \u2013 The Other Woman |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 29, 2012 |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |last=MacInnes |first=Paul}}</ref> Pete asks Joan to make a personal and moral sacrifice to ensure the company lands the Jaguar account. Meanwhile, the creatives work long nights to come up with the perfect pitch for the presentation. Don becomes furious after learning of the impact Megan's new profession will have on their life. Feeling unappreciated, Peggy has lunch with Freddy Rumsen, who encourages her to make a move. Peggy then meets with Ted Chaough, from rival firm CGC, and accepts an offer for chief copywriter.\n\n\"The Other Woman\" was critically acclaimed, with some critics calling it one of the best episodes of the series. [[Jon Hamm]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], and [[Christina Hendricks]] were lauded by journalists for their performances in this episode. \"The Other Woman\" was watched by 2.07 million viewers and received an adult 18\u201349 rating of 0.6, marking a slightly higher viewership than the previous episode.\n\n==Plot==\nThe SCDP [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] team discusses [[tagline]]s. Stan suggests one using the word \"mistress\", but Don reminds him the client would not want to hear that word in an advertisement and excuses himself. Peggy asks Don's approval of one of her projects but he tells her that she is in charge until Jaguar is done. She watches as a lobster lunch is delivered to the Jaguar team.\n\nKen and Pete dine with Herb Rennet, head of the Dealers Association and a member of Jaguar's selection committee. Herb suggests SCDP\u2019s competitive standing might be improved if they arrange an evening for him with Joan. Pete tells Joan about Herb's proposal. Shocked, she asks how Pete would feel if someone asked that of his wife Trudy. He asks Joan how much it would take to convince her. She replies that he \"couldn't afford it\".\n\nSubbing in for Ginsberg while he works on Jaguar, Peggy attends a conference call with [[Chevalier-Montrachet|Chevalier]] Blanc. The company wants to pull the Hard Day's Night ad but she spontaneously comes up with changing the existing ad to targeting women instead and wins the client over.\n\nPete presents Herb's proposal at a partners meeting, guaranteeing SCDP will lose the account if they do not comply. Don spurns the idea and leaves, but the remaining partners reluctantly agree to offer Joan $50,000. They decide to withhold Christmas bonuses and extend their credit line to cover the cost, unaware that Lane had already extended the credit line by $50,000 in the previous episode.\n\nDon instructs the Jaguar team to ditch the mistress concept because it is vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply that she is not in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.\n\nLane advises Joan to demand a 5% partnership stake in the company, adding that, when he thought he was essential to the future of the firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had ''already'' taken place.\n\nPete tells Trudy he wants an apartment in the city, but she refuses, telling him that his love affair with Manhattan is over and that they have not even been trying for a second child.\n\nThe next day, Megan tells Don that her audition gained her a callback for ''[[Little Murders]]'' and rehearsals begin shortly in Boston. He voices his displeasure at her being gone for three months. She accuses him of expecting her acting career to fail. When the callback does not go well, she tells him that, if she has to choose between him and the play, she would choose him, but will hate him for it. He assures her that he does not want her to fail, and they kiss.\n\nGinsberg approaches Don with a new Jaguar concept, portraying the car as an unattainable woman: \"Jaguar: At last, something beautiful you can truly own.\" Don smiles. Over lunch with Freddy Rumsen, Peggy gripes about her exclusion from Jaguar. Freddy suggests she leave SCDP and offers to help. The next day, Don presents the pitch to Jaguar. Herb smiles as Don unveils the tagline. Joan inquires of Don about the presentation.\n\nPeggy meets Ted Chaough from Cutler Gleason and Chaough to discuss job opportunities and he praises her work. She writes her job requirements, \"Copy Chief $18,000/year\", on a piece of paper and slides it across the table to him. Chaough crosses out $18,000 and writes $19,000. Peggy orders a chocolate shake.\n\nThe following day, Roger summons all the partners to his office to learn the fate of their Jaguar presentation. Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him it is not about money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was co-written by [[Semi Chellas]] and [[Matthew Weiner]], and directed by [[Phil Abraham]].<ref name=\"AMC Credits\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/episodes/season-5/the-other-woman |title=Mad Men \u2013 The Other Woman \u2013 AMC |publisher=AMCTV.com |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Weiner said in August 2012 that he intended for Peggy's departure from SCDP to be in \"The Other Woman\", which is centered on Joan: \"[the episode is] literally about the quantification and value of women in the workplace and the relationship of their sexuality to it.

Of course when we go to shoot the scene after setting the lights, Jon tosses the money at her, but it's just not eliciting the same response.

Having technical difficulties, they asked their friend Lars Fox to help figure out how to use them, and Fox asserted himself as their singer. Their first songs came quickly, and the trio headed to Dancing Dog Studio in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], to record with [[David Bryson]] (soon to be a member of [[Counting Crows]]).

New local record label Spirit Music Industries asked them to put out a recording,  resulting in ''[[Brown (Grotus album)|Brown]]'', introducing the group's ethnic industrial stylings. Next, the group added drummer Bruce Boyd (formerly of [[Pagan Babies (punk band)|Pagan Babies]]) to the mix, resulting in a more organic punk feel. The new line up released ''[[Luddite (EP)|Luddite]]'' on Spirit, much more a live band now, as opposed to Brown's more classic industrial sequenced machine grooves.\n\n[[Faith No More]] and [[Mr. Bungle]] singer [[Mike Patton]] championed the band, asking them to open for his band Mr Bungle, joining them for the band's first US tour, in 1992. This led to [[Alternative Tentacles]]' [[Jello Biafra]] asking the band to join their roster, which they did, releasing what many fans feel to be their best work, ''[[Slow Motion Apocalypse]]'', in 1993.\n\n=== 1993-1996: Mainstream recognition/disbandment ===\nGrotus toured relentlessly from 1993 to 1996, stopping only to record, essentially living in their van or rehearsal space. Many major labels were signing alternative bands in the early [[Post-grunge|post-Nirvana]] era and were soon sought out. They eventually signed with London Records. London released the more [[Alternative rock|rock]] oriented ''[[Mass (Grotus album)|Mass]]'' in 1996, with a remix EP (\"Handjob\") being released as a touring device in 1995 (for a tour with [[Korn]], on their first headlining tour).\n\nLondon was primarily interested in the atypical (for Grotus) song \"Hand to Mouth\", but when it failed to catch on as a single, the label dropped the band two months later after Mass' release.
