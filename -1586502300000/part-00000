The current MP for Te Atat\u016b is [[Phil Twyford]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/8/d/c/50MP123551-Twyford-Phil.htm |title=New Zealand Parliament \u2013 Twyford, Phil |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Population centres==\nThe 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886, initiated by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8\u20139, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill in an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the [[North Island]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=119}} The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Te Atatu) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the {{NZ election link|1978}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nTe Atat\u016b comprises the suburbs of [[Waitakere City]] on the western side of the [[Whau River]] in [[Auckland]]. The main parts of the seat are the suburbs of [[Glendene, New Zealand|Glendene]], [[Te Atat\u016b]], [[Lincoln, Auckland|Lincoln]] and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Boundary changes in the leadup to the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]] have seen the northern boundary edge northwards to include [[Massey East]], with a small southern block transferred to the neighbouring [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] seat.\n\nThe makeup of Te Atat\u016b shows that while its population is composed roughly inline with the national average: It is roughly the same ages as the nation (with slightly more residents over fifty), and its average income ($22627) is only slightly lower than the rest of New Zealand. Its main point of demographic difference with its country is ethnic \u2013 it has more Asian New Zealanders and more Pacific Islanders than the rest of the country.\n\n==History==\nThe Te Atatu electorate was created ahead of the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 election]] by pulling apart the seat of [[Waitemata (New Zealand electorate)|Waitemata]]; its first MP was future cabinet minister Dr [[Michael Bassett]], who had been the MP for Waitemata from [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]] until [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975]] before an anti-labour landslide cost him his job. Bassett held the seat until his retirement in 1990, when a toxic battle to succeed Bassett in an already lean year for Labour passed one of their safe seats into the hands of [[Brian Neeson]]. Neeson himself never represented the same seat twice in succession, (having jumped ship to [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] in 1993, [[Waipareira|Waipareia]] in 1996, to a new, larger Waitakere seat in 1999 before being denied the chance to contest [[Helensville (New Zealand electorate)|Helensville]] in 2002), and his departure in 1993, coupled with a reversal of electoral fortune for the National Party (down from 47.8 to 35.1 percent) lead to a victory for incoming Labour MP Chris Carter. In his first three years in Parliament, Carter made news for being the first openly gay member of Parliament.\n\nWith the introduction of [[Mixed Member Proportional|MMP]] voting in 1996, Te Atat\u016b was scrapped in favour of a new seat called Waipareira, which covered the same area as Te Atat\u016b, but also included the wealthy harbourside suburbs to the north of the seat. Neeson and Carter were rematched, when the presence of former Labour MP for [[Auckland West|West Auckland]] turned [[New Zealand First]] candidate [[Jack Elder]], undermined Carter's chances and handed the seat to Neeson by fewer than a thousand votes.\n\nThree years later, Te Atatu was re-established, with the new seat focused more on the working class suburbs at the southern end of Waitakere City and Carter had no such trouble using the seat to springboard back into Parliament. In [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002]] and [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], because the electoral climate favoured Labour, Carter and his party dominated the seat, winning at least 49 percent of the candidate and list vote, but the Labour vote was reduced in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] election.\n\n===Members of Parliament===\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}} {{Party index link|New Zealand National Party}} {{Party index link|Independent politician}} {{Party index link|Alliance (New Zealand political party)}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n! style=\"width:175px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Winner\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1978}}\n| width=5 rowspan=4 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=4 | [[Michael Bassett]]\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1981}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1984}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1987}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1990}}\n| bgcolor={{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|\n| [[Brian Neeson]]\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1993}}\n| bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>(Electorate abolished 1996\u20131999, see {{NZ electorate link|Waipareira}})</small>\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1999}}\n| width=5 rowspan=3 style=\"border-bottom:solid 0 grey; background:{{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=5 | Chris Carter\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2002}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"height:36px;\"| {{NZ election link|2008}}\n| style=\"border-top:solid 0 grey; background:{{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n|-\n| bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}|\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2011}}\n| rowspan=3 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=3 |[[Phil Twyford]]\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2017}}\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections since 1999 where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Te Atat\u016b electorate.

The current MP for Te Atat\u016b is [[Phil Twyford]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/8/d/c/50MP123551-Twyford-Phil.htm |title=New Zealand Parliament \u2013 Twyford, Phil |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Population centres==\nThe 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886, initiated by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8\u20139, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill in an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the [[North Island]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=119}} The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Te Atatu) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the {{NZ election link|1978}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nTe Atat\u016b comprises the suburbs of [[Waitakere City]] on the western side of the [[Whau River]] in [[Auckland]]. The main parts of the seat are the suburbs of [[Glendene, New Zealand|Glendene]], [[Te Atat\u016b]], [[Lincoln, Auckland|Lincoln]] and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Boundary changes in the leadup to the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]] have seen the northern boundary edge northwards to include [[Massey East]], with a small southern block transferred to the neighbouring [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] seat.\n\nThe makeup of Te Atat\u016b shows that while its population is composed roughly inline with the national average: It is roughly the same ages as the nation (with slightly more residents over fifty), and its average income ($22627) is only slightly lower than the rest of New Zealand. Its main point of demographic difference with its country is ethnic \u2013 it has more Asian New Zealanders and more Pacific Islanders than the rest of the country.\n\n==History==\nThe Te Atatu electorate was created ahead of the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 election]] by pulling apart the seat of [[Waitemata (New Zealand electorate)|Waitemata]]; its first MP was future cabinet minister Dr [[Michael Bassett]], who had been the MP for Waitemata from [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]] until [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975]] before an anti-labour landslide cost him his job. Bassett held the seat until his retirement in 1990, when a toxic battle to succeed Bassett in an already lean year for Labour passed one of their safe seats into the hands of [[Brian Neeson]]. Neeson himself never represented the same seat twice in succession, (having jumped ship to [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] in 1993, [[Waipareira|Waipareia]] in 1996, to a new, larger Waitakere seat in 1999 before being denied the chance to contest [[Helensville (New Zealand electorate)|Helensville]] in 2002), and his departure in 1993, coupled with a reversal of electoral fortune for the National Party (down from 47.8 to 35.1 percent) lead to a victory for incoming Labour MP Chris Carter. In his first three years in Parliament, Carter made news for being the first openly gay member of Parliament.\n\nWith the introduction of [[Mixed Member Proportional|MMP]] voting in 1996, Te Atat\u016b was scrapped in favour of a new seat called Waipareira, which covered the same area as Te Atat\u016b, but also included the wealthy harbourside suburbs to the north of the seat. Neeson and Carter were rematched, when the presence of former Labour MP for [[Auckland West|West Auckland]] turned [[New Zealand First]] candidate [[Jack Elder]], undermined Carter's chances and handed the seat to Neeson by fewer than a thousand votes.\n\nThree years later, Te Atatu was re-established, with the new seat focused more on the working class suburbs at the southern end of Waitakere City and Carter had no such trouble using the seat to springboard back into Parliament. In [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002]] and [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], because the electoral climate favoured Labour, Carter and his party dominated the seat, winning at least 49 percent of the candidate and list vote, but the Labour vote was reduced in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] election.\n\n===Members of Parliament===\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}} {{Party index link|New Zealand National Party}} {{Party index link|Independent politician}} {{Party index link|Alliance (New Zealand political party)}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n! style=\"width:175px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Winner\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1978}}\n| width=5 rowspan=4 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=4 | [[Michael Bassett]]\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1981}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1984}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1987}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1990}}\n| bgcolor={{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|\n| [[Brian Neeson]]\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1993}}\n| bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>(Electorate abolished 1996\u20131999, see {{NZ electorate link|Waipareira}})</small>\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1999}}\n| width=5 rowspan=3 style=\"border-bottom:solid 0 grey; background:{{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=5 | Chris Carter\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2002}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"height:36px;\"| {{NZ election link|2008}}\n| style=\"border-top:solid 0 grey; background:{{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n|-\n| bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}|\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2011}}\n| rowspan=3 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=3 |[[Phil Twyford]]\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2017}}\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections since 1999 where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Te Atat\u016b electorate.

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

The [[Portuguese Empire]] began in Morocco in the 15th century, following Portuguese conquests along the Moroccan coast, founding settlements which lasted into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] and [[Saadi dynasty|Saadi]] dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century, allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation. The [[Alaouite dynasty]], which rules to this day, seized power in 1631. The country's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe, and in 1912, Morocco was divided into [[French Morocco|French]] and [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish]] protectorates, with an [[Tangier International Zone|international zone in Tangier]]. It regained its independence in 1956, and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards, with the fifth largest economy in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&pr.y=8&sy=2018&ey=2023&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512,946,914,137,612,546,614,962,311,674,213,676,911,548,193,556,122,678,912,181,313,867,419,682,513,684,316,273,913,868,124,921,339,948,638,943,514,686,218,688,963,518,616,728,223,836,516,558,918,138,748,196,618,278,624,692,522,694,622,142,156,449,626,564,628,565,228,283,924,853,233,288,632,293,636,566,634,964,238,182,662,359,960,453,423,968,935,922,128,714,611,862,321,135,243,716,248,456,469,722,253,942,642,718,643,724,939,576,644,936,819,961,172,813,132,726,646,199,648,733,915,184,134,524,652,361,174,362,328,364,258,732,656,366,654,734,336,144,263,146,268,463,532,528,944,923,176,738,534,578,536,537,429,742,433,866,178,369,436,744,136,186,343,925,158,869,439,746,916,926,664,466,826,112,542,111,967,298,443,927,917,846,544,299,941,582,446,474,666,754,668,698,672&s=NGDPD,PPPGDP&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org}}</ref>\n\nMorocco claims the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territory]] of [[Western Sahara]], formerly [[Spanish Sahara]], as its [[Southern Provinces]].

In 2006, the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories.

In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the [[Arab Spring]] protests.

Adding Western Sahara, Morocco lies mostly between [[21st parallel north|21\u00b0]] and [[36th parallel north|36\u00b0N]], and [[1st meridian west|1\u00b0]] and [[17th meridian west|17\u00b0W]] (the [[Ras Nouadhibou]] peninsula is slightly south of 21\u00b0 and west of 17\u00b0).\n\nThe geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a [[Northern Africa]]n country, bordering the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with [[Spain]] and [[France]]) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.\n\nA large part of Morocco is mountainous. The [[Atlas Mountains]] are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The [[Rif Mountains]] are located in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the [[Berber people]]. At {{convert|446550|km2|0|abbr=on}}, Morocco excluding Western Sahara is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world. Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.\n\nSpanish territory in Northwest Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast: [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]], [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera]], [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Alhucemas]], the [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarinas]] islands, and the disputed islet [[Isla Perejil|Perejil]]. Off the Atlantic coast the [[Canary Islands]] belong to Spain, whereas [[Madeira]] to the north is [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded [[transit passage]] between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.\n\nThe Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country,<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Morocco |volume=18 |page=852 |first1=James |last1=Meakin |first2=Kate |last2=Meakin}}</ref> from the northeast to the southwest. Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the [[Sahara Desert]] and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, while to the south lies the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was annexed by Morocco in 1975 (see [[Green March]]).<ref name=\"border\">Pending resolution of the [[Western Sahara conflict]].</ref> Morocco claims that the Western Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its [[Southern Provinces]].\n\nMorocco's capital city is [[Rabat]]; its largest city is its main port, [[Casablanca]].

The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate temperatures even in summer, owing to the effect of the cold [[Canary Current]] off its [[Atlantic]] coast.\n\nIn the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree [[Endemism|endemic]] to Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.\n\nSoutheast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeastern-most portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the [[Sahara Desert]], where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush [[Oasis|oases]].\n\nIn contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal [[plain]]s are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes Morocco a country of contrasts. [[Forest|Forested areas]] cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.\n\n[[File:Merzouga sahara.jpg|thumb|Landscape of the [[Erg Chebbi]]]]\n[[File:Djebel Toubkal 01.jpg|thumb|[[Atlas Mountains]]]]\nIn general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus Morocco has the following climate zones:\n\n*'''Mediterranean:''' Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500&nbsp;km strip), and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs are between {{convert|29|C|1}} and {{convert|32|C|1}}. Winters are generally mild and wet, daily average temperatures hover around {{convert|9|C|1}} to {{convert|11|C|1}}, and average low are around {{convert|5|C|1}} to {{convert|8|C|1}}, typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean. Annual Precipitation in this area vary from 600\u2013800&nbsp;mm in the west to 350\u2013500&nbsp;mm in the east. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [[Tangier]], [[Tetouan]], [[Al Hoceima]], [[Nador]] and [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]].\n*'''Sub-Mediterranean:''' It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean. We thus have two main influencing climates:\n\n:* ''Oceanic:'' Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around {{convert|27|C|1}} and in terms of the Essaouira region, are almost always around {{convert|21|C|1}}. The medium daily temperatures can get as low as {{convert|19|C|1}}, while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700&nbsp;mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [[Rabat]], [[Casablanca]], [[K\u00e9nitra]], [[Sal\u00e9]] and [[Essaouira]].\n\n:* ''Continental:'' Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as {{convert|40|C|1}} during heat waves, but usually are between {{convert|32|C|1}} and {{convert|36|C|1}}. However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below {{convert|20|C|1}}, and sometimes as low as {{convert|10|C|1}} in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also, snow can fall occasionally. F\u00e8s for example registered {{convert|-8|C|1}} in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900&nbsp;mm. Notable cities are [[F\u00e8s]], [[Mekn\u00e8s]], [[Chefchaouen]], [[Beni-Mellal]] and [[Taza]].\n\n*'''Continental:''' Dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where summers are hot to very hot, with highs between {{convert|32|C|1}} and {{convert|36|C|1}}. Winters on the other hand are cold, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. And when cold damp air comes to Morocco from the northwest, for a few days, temperatures sometimes get below {{convert|-5|C|1}}. It often snows abundantly in this part of the country. Precipitation varies between 400 and 800&nbsp;mm. Notable cities are [[Khenifra]], [[Imilchil]], [[Midelt]] and [[Azilal]].\n*'''Alpine:''' Found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200&nbsp;mm. In summer highs barely go above {{convert|30|C|1}}, and lows are cool and average below {{convert|15|C|1}}. In winters, highs average around {{convert|8|C|1}}, and lows go well below the freezing point. In this part of country, there are many ski resorts, such as Oukaimeden and Mischliefen. Notable cities are [[Ifrane]], [[Azrou]] and [[Boulmane]].\n*'''Semi-arid:''' This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350&nbsp;mm. However, one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes. Notable cities are [[Agadir]], [[Marrakesh]] and [[Oujda]].\n\nSouth of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.\n\nDue to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when [[sirocco]] blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena do not last for more than two to five days on average.\n\nCountries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are the state of [[California]] (USA), [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Algeria]].\n\n==== Precipitation ====\nAnnual rainfall in Morocco is different according to regions. The northwestern parts of the country receive between 500&nbsp;mm and 1200&nbsp;mm, while the northeastern parts receive between 350 and 600&nbsp;mm. North Central Morocco receives between 700&nbsp;mm and up to 3500&nbsp;mm. The area from Casablanca to Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, receives between 300&nbsp;mm and 500&nbsp;mm. The regions from Essaouira to Agadir receive between 250&nbsp;mm and 400&nbsp;mm. Marrakesh region in the central south receives only 250&nbsp;mm a year. The southeastern regions, basically the driest areas, receive between 100&nbsp;mm and 200&nbsp;mm only, and consist basically of arid and desert lands.\n\nBotanically speaking, Morocco enjoys a great variety of vegetation, from lush large forests of conifer and oak trees typical of the western Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal), to shrubs and acacias further south. This is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country.\n\nMorocco's weather is one of the most pristine in terms of the four-season experience. Most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet, snowy and humid with mild, cool to cold temperatures, while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers blooming in spring and falling leaves in autumn. This type of weather has affected the Moroccan culture and behaviour and played a part in the social interaction of the population, like many other countries that fall into this type of climate zone.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Portrait of a father.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|An adult male [[Barbary macaque]] carrying his offspring, a behaviour rarely found in other primates.]]\n[[File:Barbary lion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Barbary lion]]]]\nMorocco has a wide range of [[biodiversity]].

He presides over the Council of Ministers; appoints the Prime Minister from the political party that has won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, and on recommendations from the latter, appoints the members of the government.\n\nThe previous constitution of 1996 theoretically allowed the king to terminate the tenure of any minister, and after consultation with the heads of the higher and lower Assemblies, to dissolve the Parliament, suspend the constitution, call for new elections, or rule by decree.

Tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco after the phosphate industry. The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development, in 2010 the government launched its Vision 2020 which plans to make Morocco one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world and to double the annual number of international arrivals to 20&nbsp;million by 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelnewsdigest.in/?p=16905|title=Morocco sets the goal of attracting 20 million tourists by 2020|work=India's leading B2B travel news website}}</ref> with the hope that tourism will then have risen to 20% of GDP.\n\nLarge government sponsored marketing campaigns to attract tourists advertised Morocco as a cheap and exotic, yet safe, place for tourists.

Most Europeans visit in April and the autumn.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Morocco's relatively high number of tourists has been aided by its location\u2014Morocco is close to Europe and attracts visitors to its beaches.

Morocco is relatively inexpensive because of the devaluation of the dirham and the increase of hotel prices in Spain.

The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.\n\nThere have been substantial improvements in access to water supply, and to a lesser extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighbourhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the [[National Human Development Initiative]], under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science and technology in Morocco}}\nThe [[Moroccan government]] has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs.

The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia.

Among the buildings, and old Kasbah walls, sit French style-towns left behind by colonisation and intersect with intricately detailed mosques and riad-style homes.

Under the [[Almohad]] dynasty Morocco experienced a period of prosperity and brilliance of learning. The Almohad built the [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in Marrakesh, which accommodated no fewer than 25,000 people, but was also famed for its books, manuscripts, libraries and book shops, which gave it its name; the first book bazaar in history. The Almohad Caliph [[Yusuf I, Almohad Caliph|Abu Yakub]] had a great love for collecting books. He founded a great library, which was eventually carried to the [[Casbah]] and turned into a [[public library]].\n\nModern Moroccan literature began in the 1930s. Two main factors gave Morocco a pulse toward witnessing the birth of a modern literature. Morocco, as a [[French Morocco|French]] and [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish protectorate]] left Moroccan intellectuals the opportunity to exchange and to produce literary works freely enjoying the contact of other [[Arabic literature]] and Europe.\nThree generations of writers especially shaped 20th century Moroccan literature.<ref>Mohammed Benjelloun Touimi, Abdelkbir Khatibi and Mohamed Kably, ''Ecrivains marocains, du protectorat \u00e0 1965'', 1974  \u00e9ditions Sindbad, Paris and Hassan El Ouazzani, ''La litt\u00e9rature marocaine contemporaine de 1929 \u00e0 1999'' (2002, ed. Union des \u00e9crivains du Maroc and Dar Attaqafa)</ref> The first was the generation that lived and wrote during the [[French protectorate of Morocco|Protectorate]] (1912\u201356), its most important representative being [[Mohammed Ben Brahim]] (1897\u20131955).\n\nThe second generation was the one that played an important role in the transition to independence with writers like [[Abdelkrim Ghallab]] (1919\u20132006), [[Allal al-Fassi]] (1910\u20131974) and [[Mohammed al-Mokhtar Soussi]] (1900\u20131963). The third generation is that of writers of the sixties. Moroccan literature then flourished with writers such as [[Mohamed Choukri]], [[Driss Chra\u00efbi]], [[Mohamed Zafzaf]] and [[Driss El Khouri]]. Those writers were an important influence the many Moroccan novelists, poets and playwrights that were still to come.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Morocco was a refuge and artistic centre and attracted writers as [[Paul Bowles]], [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Moroccan literature flourished with novelists such as [[Mohamed Zafzaf]] and [[Mohamed Choukri]], who wrote in Arabic, and [[Driss Chra\u00efbi]] and [[Tahar Ben Jelloun]] who wrote in French. Other important Moroccan authors include, [[Abdellatif Laabi]], [[Abdelkrim Ghallab]], [[Fouad Laroui]], [[Mohammed Berrada]] and [[Leila Abouzeid]]. Orature (oral literature) is an integral part of Moroccan culture, be it in Moroccan Arabic or Berber.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Morocco}}\nMoroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins. Rock-influenced [[chaabi (Morocco)|chaabi]] bands are widespread, as is [[trance music]] with historical origins in [[Islamic music]].\n\nMorocco is home to [[Andalusian classical music]] that is found throughout Northwest Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], and the Persian-born musician [[Ziryab]] is usually credited with its invention. A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian Music and art is the brainchild of [[Morisco]] visual artist/composer/[[oud]]ist [[Al-Andalus Ensemble|Tarik Banzi]], founder of the [http://www.Andalus.com/ Al-Andalus Ensemble].\n\n[[File:Musicians Jilala music in Morocco, 1900.png|thumb|A group of [[Jilala]] musicians in 1900]]\n''[[Aita]]'' is a [[Bedouin]] musical style sung in the countryside.\n\n[[Chaabi]] (\"popular\") is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.\n\nPopular Western forms of music are becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as [[Fusion (music)|fusion]], rock, [[Country music|country]], [[Metal (music)|metal]] and, in particular, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].\n\nMorocco participated in the [[1980 Eurovision Song Contest]], where it finished in the penultimate position.\n\n===Media===\n{{main|Media of Morocco|Cinema of Morocco}}\nCinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of ''Le chevrier Marocain'' (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]] in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the [[Ouarzazate]] area. In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the nation's film [[regulatory agency]], was established. Studios were also opened in [[Rabat]].\n\nIn 1952, [[Orson Welles]]' [[Othello (1952 film)|''Othello'']] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] under the Moroccan flag.

In its current incarnation, the event is held in [[Tetouan]]. This was followed in 1982 with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat. In 2001, the first [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]] (FIFM) was also held in [[Marrakech]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Moroccan cuisine}}\n[[File:Couscous of Fes.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Couscous]].]]\nMoroccan cuisine is considered as one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine|date=10 October 2007}}</ref> The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\nSpices are used extensively in Moroccan cuisine. While spices have been imported to Morocco for thousands of years, many ingredients such as [[saffron]] from [[T\u00e9touan|Tiliouine]], [[Mentha|mint]] and [[olive]]s from [[Meknes]], and oranges and lemons from Fez, are home-grown. Chicken is the most widely eaten meat in Morocco. The most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco is beef; [[Sheep|lamb]] is preferred but is relatively expensive. The main Moroccan dish most people are familiar with is [[couscous]],<ref>[http://maroccankitchenrecipes.blogspot.com/2014/05/moroccan-couscous.html \"Moroccan Couscous Recipe\"]. [http://maroccankitchenrecipes.blogspot.com/ Maroccan Kitchen Recipes] (Website). Retrieved 1 April 2014.</ref> the old national delicacy.\n\nBeef is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a ''Tagine'' with vegetables or legumes. Chicken is also very commonly used in Tagines, knowing that one of the most famous tagine is the Tagine of Chicken, potatoes and olives. [[domestic sheep|Lamb]] is also consumed, but as Northwest African sheep breeds store most of their fat in their tails, Moroccan lamb does not have the pungent flavour that Western [[lamb and mutton]] have. Poultry is also very common, and the use of seafood is increasing in Moroccan food. In addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as kliia/khlia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/glossary/g/khlea_khlii.htm|title=klii|author=Benlafquih, Christine |publisher=About.com}}</ref> and \"g'did\" which are used to flavor tagines or used in \"el ghraif\" a folded savory Moroccan pancake.\n\nAmong the most famous Moroccan dishes are [[Couscous]], [[Pastilla]] (also spelled Bsteeya or Bestilla), [[Tajine]], [[Tangia|Tanjia]] and [[Harira]]. Although the latter is a [[soup]], it is considered as a dish in itself and is served as such or with [[date (fruit)|dates]] especially during the month of [[Ramadan]]. Pork consumption is forbidden in accordance with [[Sharia]], religious laws of Islam.\n\nA big part of the daily meal is bread. Bread in Morocco is principally from durum wheat semolina known as [[Khubz|khobz]]. Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town and village. The most common is whole grain coarse ground or white flour bread. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads.\n\nThe most popular drink is \"atai\", [[green tea]] with mint leaves and other ingredients. Tea occupies a very important place in the culture of Morocco and is considered an art form. It is served not only at mealtimes but all through the day, and it is especially a drink of hospitality, commonly served whenever there are guests. It is served to guests, and it is impolite to refuse it.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in Morocco}}\n[[File:Morocco vs Algeria, June 04 2011-10.jpg|thumb|Moroccan football fans]]\nFootball is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular.

[[Hicham El Guerrouj]] won gold medals for Morocco at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in the [[1500 metres]] and 5000 metres and holds several [[List of world records in athletics|world record]]s in the [[mile run]].\n\n[[Spectator sports]] in Morocco traditionally centered on the art of [[horsemanship]] until European sports\u2014[[association football|football]], [[polo]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[tennis]]\u2014were introduced at the end of the 19th century.

Child health, maternal health, and diseases are all components of health and well-being. Morocco is a developing country that has made many strides to improve these categories.

According to research published, in 2005 only 16% of citizens in Morocco had health insurance or coverage.<ref name=\"Ruger_2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruger JP, Kress D | title = Health financing and insurance reform in Morocco | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 1009\u201316 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17630444 | pmc = 2898512 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.26.4.1009 }}</ref> In data from the World Bank, Morocco experiences high infant mortality rates at 20 deaths per 1,000 births (2017)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?locations=MA|title=Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)|last=|first=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> and high maternal mortality rates at 121 deaths per 100,000 births (2015).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT?locations=MA|title=Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)|last=|first=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org |access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe government of Morocco sets up surveillance systems within the already existing healthcare system to monitor and collect data. Mass education in hygiene is implemented in primary education schools which are free for residents of Morocco. In 2005, The government of Morocco approved two reforms to expand health insurance coverage.<ref name=\"Ruger_2007\" /> The first reform was a mandatory health insurance plan for public and private sector employees to expand coverage from 16 percent of the population to 30 percent. The second reform created a fund to cover services for the poor. Both reforms improved access to high-quality care. Infant mortality has improved significantly since 1960 when there were 144 deaths per 1,000 live births, in 2000, 42 per 1,000 live births, and now it is 20 per 1,000 live births.<ref name=\":5\" /> The country's under-five mortality rate dropped by 60% between 1990 and 2011.\n\nAccording to data from the World Bank,<ref name=\":5\" /> the present mortality rate is still very high, over seven times higher than in neighboring country Spain.

More effort is needed to increase access to health insurance, basic sanitation services and continue to lower infant and maternal mortality rates in the country.

The [[Portuguese Empire]] began in Morocco in the 15th century, following Portuguese conquests along the Moroccan coast, founding settlements which lasted into the 17th and 18th centuries.

The [[Alaouite dynasty]], which rules to this day, seized power in 1631.

Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([[Ceuta]]) in [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and [[Cherchell]] in [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], by the late 3rd century. The Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania after the area was devastated by the [[Vandals]] in AD 429. After this point, local Mauro-Roman kings assumed control (see [[Mauro-Roman kingdom]]). The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] under Byzantine control re-established direct imperial rule of Septum and [[Tingi]] in the 530s.

It brought both the Arabic language and [[Islam]] to the area. Although part of the larger [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]], Morocco was initially organized as a subsidiary province of [[Ifriqiya]], with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in [[Kairouan]].<ref>Abun-Nasr 1987, p.33</ref>\n\nThe indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their [[customary law]]s.

It was founded by [[Salih I ibn Mansur]] in 710, as a client state to the Umayyad Caliphate. After the outbreak of the [[Berber Revolt]] in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the [[Miknasa]] of [[Sijilmasa]] and the [[Barghawata]].\n\nAccording to medieval legend, [[Idris I of Morocco|Idris ibn Abdallah]] had fled to Morocco after the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]' massacre of his tribe in Iraq. He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs in [[Baghdad]] and he founded the [[Idrisid dynasty]] in 788. The Idrisids established [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major [[regional power]]. The Idrissids were ousted in 927 by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the [[Maghrawa]] of Sijilmasa in 980.\n\n===Dynasties===\n[[File:Empire almohade.PNG|thumb|right|The empire of the [[Almohad dynasty]] at its greatest extent, circa 1212.]]\nFrom the 11th century onwards, a series of Berber dynasties arose.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGKsS-9h4BYC&pg=PT861|title=Concise Encyclopaedia of World History |isbn=978-81-269-0775-5 |last1=Ramirez-Faria |first1=Carlos |date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/almoravides/|title=Almoravides|encyclopedia=Universalis Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/365388/Marinid-dynasty|title=Mar\u012bnid dynasty|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] and the [[Almohad dynasty]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418538/North-Africa/46490/The-Maghrib-under-the-Almoravids-and-the-Almohads |title=The Maghrib under the Almoravids and the Almohads |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Morocco dominated the Maghreb, much of present-day Spain and Portugal, and the western Mediterranean region.

Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York City but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital [[El Aai\u00fan]].\n\nIn 2002, Morocco and Spain agreed to a US-brokered resolution over the disputed island of Perejil. Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag. There were renewed tensions in 2005, as hundreds of African migrants tried to storm the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco deported hundreds of the illegal migrants. In 2006, the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year, Spanish King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.\n\nDuring the [[2011\u201312 Moroccan protests]], thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the [[Arab Spring]] protests. Despite the reforms made by Mohammed VI, demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012.

Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its ''de facto'' southern boundary is with [[Mauritania]].\n\nThe internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes [[27th parallel north|27\u00b0]] and 36\u00b0N, and longitudes 1\u00b0 and [[14th meridian west|14\u00b0W]]. Adding Western Sahara, Morocco lies mostly between [[21st parallel north|21\u00b0]] and [[36th parallel north|36\u00b0N]], and [[1st meridian west|1\u00b0]] and [[17th meridian west|17\u00b0W]] (the [[Ras Nouadhibou]] peninsula is slightly south of 21\u00b0 and west of 17\u00b0).\n\nThe geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a [[Northern Africa]]n country, bordering the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with [[Spain]] and [[France]]) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.\n\nA large part of Morocco is mountainous. The [[Atlas Mountains]] are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The [[Rif Mountains]] are located in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the [[Berber people]]. At {{convert|446550|km2|0|abbr=on}}, Morocco excluding Western Sahara is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world. Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.\n\nSpanish territory in Northwest Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast: [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]], [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera]], [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Alhucemas]], the [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarinas]] islands, and the disputed islet [[Isla Perejil|Perejil]]. Off the Atlantic coast the [[Canary Islands]] belong to Spain, whereas [[Madeira]] to the north is [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded [[transit passage]] between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.\n\nThe Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east.

The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate temperatures even in summer, owing to the effect of the cold [[Canary Current]] off its [[Atlantic]] coast.\n\nIn the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree [[Endemism|endemic]] to Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.\n\nSoutheast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeastern-most portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the [[Sahara Desert]], where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush [[Oasis|oases]].\n\nIn contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal [[plain]]s are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes Morocco a country of contrasts. [[Forest|Forested areas]] cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.\n\n[[File:Merzouga sahara.jpg|thumb|Landscape of the [[Erg Chebbi]]]]\n[[File:Djebel Toubkal 01.jpg|thumb|[[Atlas Mountains]]]]\nIn general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus Morocco has the following climate zones:\n\n*'''Mediterranean:''' Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500&nbsp;km strip), and some parts of the Atlantic coast.

Winters are generally mild and wet, daily average temperatures hover around {{convert|9|C|1}} to {{convert|11|C|1}}, and average low are around {{convert|5|C|1}} to {{convert|8|C|1}}, typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean. Annual Precipitation in this area vary from 600\u2013800&nbsp;mm in the west to 350\u2013500&nbsp;mm in the east. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [[Tangier]], [[Tetouan]], [[Al Hoceima]], [[Nador]] and [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]].\n*'''Sub-Mediterranean:''' It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean. We thus have two main influencing climates:\n\n:* ''Oceanic:'' Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around {{convert|27|C|1}} and in terms of the Essaouira region, are almost always around {{convert|21|C|1}}. The medium daily temperatures can get as low as {{convert|19|C|1}}, while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700&nbsp;mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [[Rabat]], [[Casablanca]], [[K\u00e9nitra]], [[Sal\u00e9]] and [[Essaouira]].\n\n:* ''Continental:'' Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as {{convert|40|C|1}} during heat waves, but usually are between {{convert|32|C|1}} and {{convert|36|C|1}}. However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below {{convert|20|C|1}}, and sometimes as low as {{convert|10|C|1}} in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also, snow can fall occasionally. F\u00e8s for example registered {{convert|-8|C|1}} in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900&nbsp;mm. Notable cities are [[F\u00e8s]], [[Mekn\u00e8s]], [[Chefchaouen]], [[Beni-Mellal]] and [[Taza]].\n\n*'''Continental:''' Dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where summers are hot to very hot, with highs between {{convert|32|C|1}} and {{convert|36|C|1}}. Winters on the other hand are cold, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. And when cold damp air comes to Morocco from the northwest, for a few days, temperatures sometimes get below {{convert|-5|C|1}}. It often snows abundantly in this part of the country. Precipitation varies between 400 and 800&nbsp;mm. Notable cities are [[Khenifra]], [[Imilchil]], [[Midelt]] and [[Azilal]].\n*'''Alpine:''' Found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200&nbsp;mm. In summer highs barely go above {{convert|30|C|1}}, and lows are cool and average below {{convert|15|C|1}}. In winters, highs average around {{convert|8|C|1}}, and lows go well below the freezing point. In this part of country, there are many ski resorts, such as Oukaimeden and Mischliefen. Notable cities are [[Ifrane]], [[Azrou]] and [[Boulmane]].\n*'''Semi-arid:''' This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350&nbsp;mm. However, one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes. Notable cities are [[Agadir]], [[Marrakesh]] and [[Oujda]].\n\nSouth of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.\n\nDue to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when [[sirocco]] blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena do not last for more than two to five days on average.\n\nCountries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are the state of [[California]] (USA), [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Algeria]].\n\n==== Precipitation ====\nAnnual rainfall in Morocco is different according to regions. The northwestern parts of the country receive between 500&nbsp;mm and 1200&nbsp;mm, while the northeastern parts receive between 350 and 600&nbsp;mm. North Central Morocco receives between 700&nbsp;mm and up to 3500&nbsp;mm. The area from Casablanca to Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, receives between 300&nbsp;mm and 500&nbsp;mm. The regions from Essaouira to Agadir receive between 250&nbsp;mm and 400&nbsp;mm. Marrakesh region in the central south receives only 250&nbsp;mm a year. The southeastern regions, basically the driest areas, receive between 100&nbsp;mm and 200&nbsp;mm only, and consist basically of arid and desert lands.\n\nBotanically speaking, Morocco enjoys a great variety of vegetation, from lush large forests of conifer and oak trees typical of the western Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal), to shrubs and acacias further south. This is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country.\n\nMorocco's weather is one of the most pristine in terms of the four-season experience. Most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet, snowy and humid with mild, cool to cold temperatures, while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers blooming in spring and falling leaves in autumn. This type of weather has affected the Moroccan culture and behaviour and played a part in the social interaction of the population, like many other countries that fall into this type of climate zone.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Portrait of a father.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|An adult male [[Barbary macaque]] carrying his offspring, a behaviour rarely found in other primates.]]\n[[File:Barbary lion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Barbary lion]]]]\nMorocco has a wide range of [[biodiversity]].

He presides over the Council of Ministers; appoints the Prime Minister from the political party that has won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, and on recommendations from the latter, appoints the members of the government.\n\nThe previous constitution of 1996 theoretically allowed the king to terminate the tenure of any minister, and after consultation with the heads of the higher and lower Assemblies, to dissolve the Parliament, suspend the constitution, call for new elections, or rule by decree. The only time this happened was in 1965. The King is formally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\n===Legislative branch===\n[[File:Parliament of morocco.jpg|thumb|The legislature's building in Rabat.]]\nSince the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The [[Assembly of Representatives of Morocco]] (''Majlis an-Nuww\u00e2b/Assembl\u00e9e des R\u00e9presentants'') has 325 members elected for a five-year term, 295 elected in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] and 30 in national lists consisting only of women. The [[Assembly of Councillors]] (''Majlis al-Mustasharin'') has 270 members, elected for a nine-year term, elected by local councils (162 seats), professional chambers (91 seats) and wage-earners (27 seats).\n\nThe Parliament's powers, though still relatively limited, were expanded under the 1992 and 1996 and even further in the 2011 constitutional revisions and include [[budget]]ary matters, approving [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s, questioning ministers, and establishing ad hoc commissions of inquiry to investigate the government's actions. The lower chamber of Parliament may dissolve the government through a [[vote of no confidence]].\n\nThe latest parliamentary elections were held on [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2011|November 25, 2011]], and were considered by some neutral observers to be mostly free and fair. Voter turnout in these elections was estimated to be 43% of registered voters.\n\n===Military===\n[[File:FREMM Mohammed VI - Lorient 2013-05.JPG|thumb|Mohammed VI, a [[FREMM multipurpose frigate]] of the [[Royal Moroccan Navy]].]]\n[[File:Lion120051.jpg|thumb|US Marines and Moroccan soldiers during exercise African Lion in Tan tan.]]\n{{main|Royal Moroccan Armed Forces}}\nCompulsory military service in Morocco has been officially suspended since September 2006, and Morocco's reserve obligation lasts until age 50.

It is well developed with a strong tourist industry focused on the country's coast, culture, and history. Morocco attracted more than 11&nbsp;million tourists in 2017. Tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco after the phosphate industry. The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development, in 2010 the government launched its Vision 2020 which plans to make Morocco one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world and to double the annual number of international arrivals to 20&nbsp;million by 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelnewsdigest.in/?p=16905|title=Morocco sets the goal of attracting 20 million tourists by 2020|work=India's leading B2B travel news website}}</ref> with the hope that tourism will then have risen to 20% of GDP.\n\nLarge government sponsored marketing campaigns to attract tourists advertised Morocco as a cheap and exotic, yet safe, place for tourists. Most of the visitors to Morocco continue to be European, with French nationals making up almost 20% of all visitors. Most Europeans visit in April and the autumn.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Morocco's relatively high number of tourists has been aided by its location\u2014Morocco is close to Europe and attracts visitors to its beaches. Because of its proximity to Spain, tourists in southern Spain's coastal areas take one- to three-day trips to Morocco.\n\nSince air services between Morocco and Algeria have been established, many Algerians have gone to Morocco to shop and visit family and friends. Morocco is relatively inexpensive because of the devaluation of the dirham and the increase of hotel prices in Spain. Morocco has an excellent road and rail infrastructure that links the major cities and tourist destinations with ports and cities with international airports. Low-cost airlines offer cheap flights to the country.\n\n[[File:Fes (5364214781).jpg|thumb|View of the medina (old city) of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]].]]\n\nTourism is increasingly focused on Morocco's culture, such as its ancient cities.

The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.\n\nThere have been substantial improvements in access to water supply, and to a lesser extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighbourhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the [[National Human Development Initiative]], under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science and technology in Morocco}}\nThe [[Moroccan government]] has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs. In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research. The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia. He announced that investment in science and technology would rise from US$620,000 in 2008 to US$8.5 million (69 million Moroccan dirhams) in 2009, in order to finance the refurbishment and construction of laboratories, training courses for researchers in financial management, a scholarship programme for postgraduate research and incentive measures for companies prepared to finance research, such as giving them access to scientific results that they could then use to develop new products.<ref name=\"scidev.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/middle-east-and-north-africa/news/morocco-to-boost-investment-in-science.html|title=Morocco to boost investment in science|last=SciDev.Net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Moroccan Innovation Strategy'' was launched at the country's first National Innovation Summit in June 2009 by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Investment and the Digital Economy.

In 2012, Moroccan inventors applied for 197 patents, up from 152 two years earlier. In 2011, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and New Technologies created a Moroccan Club of Innovation, in partnership with the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property.

Through [[History of Morocco|Moroccan history]], it has hosted many people coming from East ([[Phoenicians]], [[Jews]] and [[Arabs]]), South ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]]ns) and North ([[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]]). All those civilisations have affected the social structure of Morocco.\n\nSince independence, a veritable blossoming has taken place in painting and sculpture, popular music, amateur theatre, and filmmaking.<ref>e.g. Khalid Amine and Marvin Carlson, ''The Theatres of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia: Performance Traditions of the Maghreb'' (Dordrecht NL: Springer, 2011), 124-28. {{ISBN|0230358519}}</ref> The Moroccan National Theatre (founded 1956) offers regular productions of Moroccan and French dramatic works.

The [[vernacular architecture]] can range from ornate with bold with colours to simple, clean lines with earth tones.\n\nInfluences from the Arab world, Spain, Portugal and France are seen in [[Moroccan architecture]], both on their own and blended with Berber and Islamic styles. Among the buildings, and old Kasbah walls, sit French style-towns left behind by colonisation and intersect with intricately detailed mosques and riad-style homes. Sleek, modern designs are being constructed in cities like Rabat and Casablanca that give no particular homage to any of the past Moroccan architecture styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heymorocco.com/morocco-architecture.aspx|title=Morocco Architecture|website=heymorocco.com}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Moroccan literature}}\n[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo Portrait of a Humanist.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leo Africanus]].]]\nMoroccan literature is written in Arabic, Berber and French. Under the [[Almohad]] dynasty Morocco experienced a period of prosperity and brilliance of learning. The Almohad built the [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in Marrakesh, which accommodated no fewer than 25,000 people, but was also famed for its books, manuscripts, libraries and book shops, which gave it its name; the first book bazaar in history. The Almohad Caliph [[Yusuf I, Almohad Caliph|Abu Yakub]] had a great love for collecting books. He founded a great library, which was eventually carried to the [[Casbah]] and turned into a [[public library]].\n\nModern Moroccan literature began in the 1930s. Two main factors gave Morocco a pulse toward witnessing the birth of a modern literature. Morocco, as a [[French Morocco|French]] and [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish protectorate]] left Moroccan intellectuals the opportunity to exchange and to produce literary works freely enjoying the contact of other [[Arabic literature]] and Europe.\nThree generations of writers especially shaped 20th century Moroccan literature.<ref>Mohammed Benjelloun Touimi, Abdelkbir Khatibi and Mohamed Kably, ''Ecrivains marocains, du protectorat \u00e0 1965'', 1974  \u00e9ditions Sindbad, Paris and Hassan El Ouazzani, ''La litt\u00e9rature marocaine contemporaine de 1929 \u00e0 1999'' (2002, ed. Union des \u00e9crivains du Maroc and Dar Attaqafa)</ref> The first was the generation that lived and wrote during the [[French protectorate of Morocco|Protectorate]] (1912\u201356), its most important representative being [[Mohammed Ben Brahim]] (1897\u20131955).\n\nThe second generation was the one that played an important role in the transition to independence with writers like [[Abdelkrim Ghallab]] (1919\u20132006), [[Allal al-Fassi]] (1910\u20131974) and [[Mohammed al-Mokhtar Soussi]] (1900\u20131963). The third generation is that of writers of the sixties. Moroccan literature then flourished with writers such as [[Mohamed Choukri]], [[Driss Chra\u00efbi]], [[Mohamed Zafzaf]] and [[Driss El Khouri]]. Those writers were an important influence the many Moroccan novelists, poets and playwrights that were still to come.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Morocco was a refuge and artistic centre and attracted writers as [[Paul Bowles]], [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Moroccan literature flourished with novelists such as [[Mohamed Zafzaf]] and [[Mohamed Choukri]], who wrote in Arabic, and [[Driss Chra\u00efbi]] and [[Tahar Ben Jelloun]] who wrote in French. Other important Moroccan authors include, [[Abdellatif Laabi]], [[Abdelkrim Ghallab]], [[Fouad Laroui]], [[Mohammed Berrada]] and [[Leila Abouzeid]]. Orature (oral literature) is an integral part of Moroccan culture, be it in Moroccan Arabic or Berber.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Morocco}}\nMoroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins. Rock-influenced [[chaabi (Morocco)|chaabi]] bands are widespread, as is [[trance music]] with historical origins in [[Islamic music]].\n\nMorocco is home to [[Andalusian classical music]] that is found throughout Northwest Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], and the Persian-born musician [[Ziryab]] is usually credited with its invention. A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian Music and art is the brainchild of [[Morisco]] visual artist/composer/[[oud]]ist [[Al-Andalus Ensemble|Tarik Banzi]], founder of the [http://www.Andalus.com/ Al-Andalus Ensemble].\n\n[[File:Musicians Jilala music in Morocco, 1900.png|thumb|A group of [[Jilala]] musicians in 1900]]\n''[[Aita]]'' is a [[Bedouin]] musical style sung in the countryside.\n\n[[Chaabi]] (\"popular\") is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.\n\nPopular Western forms of music are becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as [[Fusion (music)|fusion]], rock, [[Country music|country]], [[Metal (music)|metal]] and, in particular, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].\n\nMorocco participated in the [[1980 Eurovision Song Contest]], where it finished in the penultimate position.\n\n===Media===\n{{main|Media of Morocco|Cinema of Morocco}}\nCinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of ''Le chevrier Marocain'' (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]] in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the [[Ouarzazate]] area. In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the nation's film [[regulatory agency]], was established. Studios were also opened in [[Rabat]].\n\nIn 1952, [[Orson Welles]]' [[Othello (1952 film)|''Othello'']] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] under the Moroccan flag. However, the Festival's musicians did not play the [[Hymne Ch\u00e9rifien|Moroccan national anthem]], as no one in attendance knew what it was.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/filming_othello.htm|title=Wellesnet: Filming Othello|website=www.wellesnet.com}}</ref> Six years later, Mohammed Ousfour would create the first Moroccan movie, ''Le fils maudit'' (\"The Damned Son\").\n\nIn 1968, the first Mediterranean Film Festival was held in [[Tangier]]. In its current incarnation, the event is held in [[Tetouan]]. This was followed in 1982 with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat. In 2001, the first [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]] (FIFM) was also held in [[Marrakech]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Moroccan cuisine}}\n[[File:Couscous of Fes.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Couscous]].]]\nMoroccan cuisine is considered as one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine|date=10 October 2007}}</ref> The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\nSpices are used extensively in Moroccan cuisine. While spices have been imported to Morocco for thousands of years, many ingredients such as [[saffron]] from [[T\u00e9touan|Tiliouine]], [[Mentha|mint]] and [[olive]]s from [[Meknes]], and oranges and lemons from Fez, are home-grown. Chicken is the most widely eaten meat in Morocco. The most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco is beef; [[Sheep|lamb]] is preferred but is relatively expensive. The main Moroccan dish most people are familiar with is [[couscous]],<ref>[http://maroccankitchenrecipes.blogspot.com/2014/05/moroccan-couscous.html \"Moroccan Couscous Recipe\"]. [http://maroccankitchenrecipes.blogspot.com/ Maroccan Kitchen Recipes] (Website). Retrieved 1 April 2014.</ref> the old national delicacy.\n\nBeef is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a ''Tagine'' with vegetables or legumes. Chicken is also very commonly used in Tagines, knowing that one of the most famous tagine is the Tagine of Chicken, potatoes and olives. [[domestic sheep|Lamb]] is also consumed, but as Northwest African sheep breeds store most of their fat in their tails, Moroccan lamb does not have the pungent flavour that Western [[lamb and mutton]] have. Poultry is also very common, and the use of seafood is increasing in Moroccan food. In addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as kliia/khlia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/glossary/g/khlea_khlii.htm|title=klii|author=Benlafquih, Christine |publisher=About.com}}</ref> and \"g'did\" which are used to flavor tagines or used in \"el ghraif\" a folded savory Moroccan pancake.\n\nAmong the most famous Moroccan dishes are [[Couscous]], [[Pastilla]] (also spelled Bsteeya or Bestilla), [[Tajine]], [[Tangia|Tanjia]] and [[Harira]]. Although the latter is a [[soup]], it is considered as a dish in itself and is served as such or with [[date (fruit)|dates]] especially during the month of [[Ramadan]]. Pork consumption is forbidden in accordance with [[Sharia]], religious laws of Islam.\n\nA big part of the daily meal is bread. Bread in Morocco is principally from durum wheat semolina known as [[Khubz|khobz]]. Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town and village. The most common is whole grain coarse ground or white flour bread. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads.\n\nThe most popular drink is \"atai\", [[green tea]] with mint leaves and other ingredients. Tea occupies a very important place in the culture of Morocco and is considered an art form. It is served not only at mealtimes but all through the day, and it is especially a drink of hospitality, commonly served whenever there are guests. It is served to guests, and it is impolite to refuse it.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in Morocco}}\n[[File:Morocco vs Algeria, June 04 2011-10.jpg|thumb|Moroccan football fans]]\nFootball is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular.

[[Nawal El Moutawakel]] won in the [[400 metres hurdles]]; she was the first woman from an Arab or Islamic country to win an Olympic gold medal.

The second reform created a fund to cover services for the poor. Both reforms improved access to high-quality care. Infant mortality has improved significantly since 1960 when there were 144 deaths per 1,000 live births, in 2000, 42 per 1,000 live births, and now it is 20 per 1,000 live births.<ref name=\":5\" /> The country's under-five mortality rate dropped by 60% between 1990 and 2011.\n\nAccording to data from the World Bank,<ref name=\":5\" /> the present mortality rate is still very high, over seven times higher than in neighboring country Spain.

More effort is needed to increase access to health insurance, basic sanitation services and continue to lower infant and maternal mortality rates in the country.
