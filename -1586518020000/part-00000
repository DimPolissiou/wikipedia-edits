He is often called the \"father of literary Finnish\". \n\nAgricola was consecrated as the [[bishop of Turku]] (\u00c5bo) in 1554, without papal approval. He continued the [[Reformation in Sweden|reform]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland#Part of the Church of Sweden|Finnish church (then a part of the Church of Sweden)]] along [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] lines.  He translated the New Testament into Finnish and also produced the prayer book and hymns used in Finland's new Lutheran Church.  This work set the rules of orthography that are the basis of modern Finnish spelling.  His thorough work is particularly remarkable in that he accomplished it in only three years. \n\nHe died of sudden illness while returning from a trip during which he assisted in negotiating the [[Treaty of Novgorod (1557)|Treaty of Novgorod]] with the [[Tsardom of Russia]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMichael Olaui or Mikkel Olofsson (Finnish ''Mikael Olavinpoika'') was born in c. 1510 in the village of Torsby in [[Pern\u00e5]] (''Pernaja''), [[Uusimaa|Nyland]] (''Uusimaa''), in what now is part of [[Finland]]) but then was part of the [[Kalmar Union]]. He was named after the patron saint of Pern\u00e5's church. The exact date of his birth, like most details of his life, is unknown. His family was a quite wealthy peasant family according to the local [[bailiff]]'s accounting. He had three sisters, but their names are not known. His teachers apparently recognized his aptitude for languages and his rector Bartholomeus sent him to [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Fi. ''Viipuri''; now Vyborg, [[Russia]]) for [[Latin school]] and some [[priest]]ly training, where he attended the school of Erasmus. It is not known whether his first language was Finnish or Swedish; Pern\u00e5 was mostly a Swedish-speaking district, but the language he used in his works indicates that he was a native speaker of Finnish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin it\u00e4maa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteraturs\u00e4llskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=978-951-583-212-2|location=Helsinki|pages=236-243}}</ref> However, he mastered both languages like a native speaker and was possibly a bilingual child.<ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=14 |title=Agricola, Mikael (1510\u20131557)  |last1= Heininen |first1= Simo |date=2014 |website= The National Biography of Finland |accessdate=2016-04-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Studies===\nWhen Michael studied in [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Viipuri) he assumed the surname Agricola (\"farmer\" gv. \"agriculture\"); surnames based on one's father's status and occupation were common for first-generation scholars at the time. It was probably in Viipuri where he first came in touch with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Humanism]]. The Viipuri castle was ruled by a German count, [[John_VII_of_Hoya|Johann]], who had served the king of Sweden, [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]]. The count was a supporter of the Reformation, and they already held [[Lutheran]] services.<ref name=\"KB\"/>\n\nIn 1528 Agricola followed his teacher to [[Turku]] (\u00c5bo), then the center of the Finnish side of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] realm and the capital of the [[Diocese|bishopric]]. There Agricola became a scribe in bishop [[Martinus Skytte]]'s office.<ref name=\"KB\"/> While in Turku Agricola met [[Martin Luther]]'s first Finnish student [[Petrus S\u00e4rkilahti]], who eagerly spread the idea of the Reformation. S\u00e4rkilahti died in 1529, and it was up to Agricola to continue S\u00e4rkilahti's work. Agricola was ordained for priesthood circa 1531.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1536 the bishop of Turku sent Agricola to study in [[Wittenberg]] in Germany. He concentrated on the lectures of [[Philipp Melanchthon]], who was an expert in [[Greek (language)|Greek]], the original language of the [[New Testament]]. In Wittenberg Agricola studied under Luther.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5&vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] entry on Agricola, Michael.</ref> Agricola got recommendations to Swedish King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] from both of the reformists. He sent two letters to Gustav, asking for a confirmation for a [[stipend]]. When the confirmation came, Agricola bought books (for example, the complete works of [[Aristotle]]). In 1537 he started translating the New Testament into Finnish.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Rector and ordinarius===\nIn 1539 Agricola returned to Turku and ended up as the rector of Turku (Cathedral) School. He did not like his job, calling his students \"untamed animals\". At the time Gustav Vasa had confiscated the property of the church when he was consolidating his power but he also drove the Reformation. In 1544 Agricola received an order from the crown to send several talented young men to [[Stockholm]]'s taxing offices. For some reason, Agricola did not obey until the order was sent again the next year, with a more menacing tone. This episode probably affected their relations negatively.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1546 Agricola lost his home and school in the Fire of Turku. On 22 February 1548, Gustav Vasa ordered Agricola to retire from his position as a rector. At this time Agricola was already married, but history knows his wife only by her name: Pirjo Olavintyt\u00e4r (Bridget, \"daughter of Olavi\"; Birgitta Olafsdotter, Brigida Olaui). His only son, [[Christian Agricola]] (Christianus Michaelis Agricola), was born 11 December 1550, and became the bishop of [[Tallinn]] in 1584.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Gravestone of Mikael Agricola.jpg|thumb|right|Monument on the place of Mikael Agricola's death near [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Primorsk]]]]\nWhen an old bishop died in 1554, Gustav Vasa had Agricola consecrated as the ''[[Ordinary (officer)|ordinarius]]'' of Turku parish \u2013 for all practical purposes [[Bishop]] of Turku and by extension the first Lutheran bishop for all Finland. Agricola was not a particularly strict or dedicated reformer, although he did remove the [[Canon of the Mass]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Death and commemorations==\nIn 1557, Agricola headed a delegation going to [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] on a diplomatic mission, and was in [[Moscow]] from 21 February to 24 March negotiating a [[peace treaty]], the [[Treaty of Novgorod (1557)]].

He is often called the \"father of literary Finnish\". \n\nAgricola was consecrated as the [[bishop of Turku]] (\u00c5bo) in 1554, without papal approval. He continued the [[Reformation in Sweden|reform]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland#Part of the Church of Sweden|Finnish church (then a part of the Church of Sweden)]] along [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] lines.  He translated the New Testament into Finnish and also produced the prayer book and hymns used in Finland's new Lutheran Church.  This work set the rules of orthography that are the basis of modern Finnish spelling.  His thorough work is particularly remarkable in that he accomplished it in only three years. \n\nHe died of sudden illness while returning from a trip during which he assisted in negotiating the [[Treaty of Novgorod (1557)|Treaty of Novgorod]] with the [[Tsardom of Russia]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMichael Olaui or Mikkel Olofsson (Finnish ''Mikael Olavinpoika'') was born in c. 1510 in the village of Torsby in [[Pern\u00e5]] (''Pernaja''), [[Uusimaa|Nyland]] (''Uusimaa''), in what now is part of [[Finland]]) but then was part of the [[Kalmar Union]]. He was named after the patron saint of Pern\u00e5's church. The exact date of his birth, like most details of his life, is unknown. His family was a quite wealthy peasant family according to the local [[bailiff]]'s accounting. He had three sisters, but their names are not known. His teachers apparently recognized his aptitude for languages and his rector Bartholomeus sent him to [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Fi. ''Viipuri''; now Vyborg, [[Russia]]) for [[Latin school]] and some [[priest]]ly training, where he attended the school of Erasmus. It is not known whether his first language was Finnish or Swedish; Pern\u00e5 was mostly a Swedish-speaking district, but the language he used in his works indicates that he was a native speaker of Finnish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin it\u00e4maa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteraturs\u00e4llskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=978-951-583-212-2|location=Helsinki|pages=236-243}}</ref> However, he mastered both languages like a native speaker and was possibly a bilingual child.<ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=14 |title=Agricola, Mikael (1510\u20131557)  |last1= Heininen |first1= Simo |date=2014 |website= The National Biography of Finland |accessdate=2016-04-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Studies===\nWhen Michael studied in [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Viipuri) he assumed the surname Agricola (\"farmer\" gv. \"agriculture\"); surnames based on one's father's status and occupation were common for first-generation scholars at the time. It was probably in Viipuri where he first came in touch with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Humanism]]. The Viipuri castle was ruled by a German count, [[John_VII_of_Hoya|Johann]], who had served the king of Sweden, [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]]. The count was a supporter of the Reformation, and they already held [[Lutheran]] services.<ref name=\"KB\"/>\n\nIn 1528 Agricola followed his teacher to [[Turku]] (\u00c5bo), then the center of the Finnish side of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] realm and the capital of the [[Diocese|bishopric]]. There Agricola became a scribe in bishop [[Martinus Skytte]]'s office.<ref name=\"KB\"/> While in Turku Agricola met [[Martin Luther]]'s first Finnish student [[Petrus S\u00e4rkilahti]], who eagerly spread the idea of the Reformation. S\u00e4rkilahti died in 1529, and it was up to Agricola to continue S\u00e4rkilahti's work. Agricola was ordained for priesthood circa 1531.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1536 the bishop of Turku sent Agricola to study in [[Wittenberg]] in Germany. He concentrated on the lectures of [[Philipp Melanchthon]], who was an expert in [[Greek (language)|Greek]], the original language of the [[New Testament]]. In Wittenberg Agricola studied under Luther.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5&vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] entry on Agricola, Michael.</ref> Agricola got recommendations to Swedish King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] from both of the reformists. He sent two letters to Gustav, asking for a confirmation for a [[stipend]]. When the confirmation came, Agricola bought books (for example, the complete works of [[Aristotle]]). In 1537 he started translating the New Testament into Finnish.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Rector and ordinarius===\nIn 1539 Agricola returned to Turku and ended up as the rector of Turku (Cathedral) School. He did not like his job, calling his students \"untamed animals\". At the time Gustav Vasa had confiscated the property of the church when he was consolidating his power but he also drove the Reformation. In 1544 Agricola received an order from the crown to send several talented young men to [[Stockholm]]'s taxing offices. For some reason, Agricola did not obey until the order was sent again the next year, with a more menacing tone. This episode probably affected their relations negatively.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1546 Agricola lost his home and school in the Fire of Turku. On 22 February 1548, Gustav Vasa ordered Agricola to retire from his position as a rector. At this time Agricola was already married, but history knows his wife only by her name: Pirjo Olavintyt\u00e4r (Bridget, \"daughter of Olavi\"; Birgitta Olafsdotter, Brigida Olaui). His only son, [[Christian Agricola]] (Christianus Michaelis Agricola), was born 11 December 1550, and became the bishop of [[Tallinn]] in 1584.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Gravestone of Mikael Agricola.jpg|thumb|right|Monument on the place of Mikael Agricola's death near [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Primorsk]]]]\nWhen an old bishop died in 1554, Gustav Vasa had Agricola consecrated as the ''[[Ordinary (officer)|ordinarius]]'' of Turku parish \u2013 for all practical purposes [[Bishop]] of Turku and by extension the first Lutheran bishop for all Finland.

The Indiana Hospital for the Insane finally opened in November 1848 with a total of five patients. At that time, the hospital consisted of one brick building situated on a large parcel of land of over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} on [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]], west of [[downtown Indianapolis]]. In 1889 the hospital was renamed the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane. After 1926 it was known as Central State Hospital, and by 1928, physicians cared for nearly 3,000 patients.\n\nFrom 1848 to 1948, the hospital grew yearly until it encompassed two massive ornate buildings (one for male and one for female patients); a pathological department; a \"sick\" hospital for the treatment of physical ailments; a farm colony where patients engaged in \"occupational therapy\"; a chapel; an amusement hall complete with an auditorium, billiards, and bowling alleys; a bakery; a fire house; a cannery manned by patients; and idyllic gardens and fountains.\n\nThe more ornate of the two massive buildings came to be known as \"the Seven Steeples\". This building, which housed female patients, was designed using the [[Kirkbride Plan]] for mental healthcare facilities.\n\nFor a half-century, this complex buildings and gardens housed mentally ill patients from all regions of Indiana. By 1905, however, the state had built mental health institutions in [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]], [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]], and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], thereby relieving an overcrowded Central State Hospital of some of its patient load and leaving it to treat only those from the \"central district\", an area of 38 counties situated in the middle portion of the state. In 1950 patient population reached 2,500\n\nBy the early 1970s, most of the hospital's ostentatious Victorian-era buildings had been declared unsound and razed. The Men's Department Building (also a Kirkbride Plan structure) had been demolished already in 1941. In their place, the state constructed brick buildings of a nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings and the medical staff therein continued to serve the state's mentally ill until allegations of [[patient abuse]] and funding troubles sparked an effort to forge new alternatives to institutionalization which, in turn, led to the hospital's closure in 1994.\n\n==Current status==\n[[Image:1886powerplant.jpg|thumb|The 1886 Power Plant]]\nThe grounds of Central State Hospital were still largely vacant as of 2011. In place of the demolished Women's Ward (Seven Steeples) is a large lawn. There are approximately 10 buildings on the grounds that were associated with the hospital. The Pathology Department building, built in 1895, is well preserved and houses the [[Indiana Medical History Museum]]. The three more modern wards (Evans, Bolton, and Bahr) were built in 1974 when the others were demolished. The oldest building on the property is the old power house, built in 1886.

The Indiana Hospital for the Insane finally opened in November, 1848 with a total of five patients. At that time, the hospital consisted of one brick building situated on a large parcel of land of over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} on [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]], west of [[downtown Indianapolis]]. In 1889 the hospital was renamed the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane. After 1926 it was known as Central State Hospital, and by 1928, physicians cared for nearly 3,000 patients.\n\nFrom 1848 to 1948, the hospital grew yearly until it encompassed two massive ornate buildings (one for male and one for female patients); a pathological department; a \"sick\" hospital for the treatment of physical ailments; a farm colony where patients engaged in \"occupational therapy\"; a chapel; an amusement hall complete with an auditorium, billiards, and bowling alleys; a bakery; a fire house; a cannery manned by patients; and idyllic gardens and fountains.\n\nThe more ornate of the two massive buildings came to be known as \"the Seven Steeples\". This building, which housed female patients, was designed using the [[Kirkbride Plan]] for mental healthcare facilities.\n\nFor a half-century, this complex buildings and gardens housed mentally ill patients from all regions of Indiana. By 1905, however, the state had built mental health institutions in [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]], [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]], and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], thereby relieving an overcrowded Central State Hospital of some of its patient load and leaving it to treat only those from the \"central district\", an area of 38 counties situated in the middle portion of the state. In 1950 patient population reached 2,500\n\nBy the early 1970s, most of the hospital's ostentatious Victorian-era buildings had been declared unsound and razed. The Men's Department Building (also a Kirkbride Plan structure) had been demolished already in 1941. In their place, the state constructed brick buildings of a nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings and the medical staff therein continued to serve the state's mentally ill until allegations of [[patient abuse]] and funding troubles sparked an effort to forge new alternatives to institutionalization which, in turn, led to the hospital's closure in 1994.\n\n==Current status==\n[[Image:1886powerplant.jpg|thumb|The 1886 Power Plant]]\nThe grounds of Central State Hospital were still largely vacant as of 2011. In place of the demolished Women's Ward (Seven Steeples) is a large lawn. There are approximately 10 buildings on the grounds that were associated with the hospital. The Pathology Department building, built in 1895, is well preserved and houses the [[Indiana Medical History Museum]]. The three more modern wards (Evans, Bolton, and Bahr) were built in 1974 when the others were demolished. The oldest building on the property is the old power house, built in 1886. The Administration building, which was built in 1938, is now most commonly associated with the hospital, although it never housed patients. In 2005, the Beckmann Theatre was granted temporary occupancy of the 1895 Laundry Building where it staged its production of \"Asylum\".<ref>[http://www.beckmanntheatre.org/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802214906/http://www.beckmanntheatre.org/ |date=August 2, 2008 }}</ref> More recently, the building has been used for storing cars.\n\nThe Indiana State Archives, the Indiana State Library, and the Indiana Medical History Museum (housed in one of the hospital's remaining nineteenth-century edifices), are preserving the history of an institution that served the mentally ill of Indiana for 146 years.\n\n[[Image:centralstatelg.jpg|thumb|Buildings on the Grounds of Central State]]In March 2003, the city of Indianapolis purchased the property from the state for $400,000.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]]. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s character Archie, of ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]'', said, perhaps playing on [[Reykjav\u00edk]] meaning \"smoky bay\", that the \"Reykjav\u00edk of the South\" would be more appropriate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stoppard|first= Tom|author-link=Tom Stoppard|title=Jumpers|title-link=Jumpers (play)|publisher= Grove Press|date=1972|p= 69}}</ref>\n\nThe city has also been known by several [[List of Latin place names in Britain#Cities and towns in Scotland|Latin names]] such as ''Edinburgum'' while the adjectival forms ''Edinburgensis'' and ''Edinensis'' are used in educational and scientific contexts.<ref name=\"Gr\u00e4sse1909\">{{cite book|last=Gr\u00e4sse|first=Johann Georg Theodor |authorlink=Johann Georg Theodor Gr\u00e4sse|title=Orbis latinus: oder Verzeichnis der wichtigsten lateinischen Orts- und L\u00e4ndernamen|edition=2nd|trans-title=Orbis latinus : or List of the most important latin place and country names|year=1909|publisher=Richard Carl Schmidt|location=Berlin |language=de|title-link=Orbis Latinus|orig-year=1861}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.herbdatanz.com/pharmaceutical_latin_abbreviations.htm |title=Pharmaceutical Latin Abbreviations |publisher=Herbdatanz.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505111506/http://www.herbdatanz.com/pharmaceutical_latin_abbreviations.htm |archivedate=5 May 2006 }}</ref>\n\n''Edina'' is a late 18th century poetical form used by the Scots poets [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Robert Burns]]. \"Embra\" or \"Embro\" are colloquialisms from the same time,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.purr.demon.co.uk/embro/ |title=Embro, Embro \u2013 the hidden history of Edinburgh in its music |publisher=Purr.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627000502/http://www.purr.demon.co.uk/embro/ |archive-date=27 June 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> as in [[Robert Garioch]]'s ''Embro to the Ploy''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk/makars/garioch/embro.html |title=Makars Literary Tour &#124; Robert Garioch |publisher=Edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703111205/http://www.edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk/makars/garioch/embro.html |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n[[Ben Jonson]] described it as \"Britaine's other eye\",<ref>[http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817133048/http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 |date=17 August 2011 }}.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]].

It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at [[Apollo Bunder]], Mumbai (then Bombay) of [[Emperor of India|King-Emperor]] [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen-Empress Mary]], the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the [[Indo-Saracenic]] style. The final design of the monument by architect [[George Wittet]] was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a [[triumphal arch]] made of [[basalt]], which is {{convert|26|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} high.\n\nAfter its construction the gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to British India for important colonial personnel. It has been called a symbol of \"conquest and colonisation\" commemorating British colonial legacy. The gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel]] and overlooks the [[Arabian Sea]]. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for [[Hanukkah]] celebrations, with the lighting of the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], since 2003. There are five jetties located at the gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.\n\nThe gateway was the site of a [[25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings|terror attack in August 2003]], when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.\n\nIn March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.\n\n==History and significance==\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/1|total_width=200|| align=left|caption_align=left\n| image1 = Gateway of India, Bombay. 1911.JPG|caption1=The gateway, in 1924\n| image2 = Departure of British Troops from India - 28 February 1948 - Gateway of India.jpg|caption2=Departure of the last British troops from the gateway, in 1948}}\nThe gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the [[Delhi Durbar|Delhi Durbar of 1911]]; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.{{sfn|Dup\u00e9e, Jeffrey N.|2008|p=114}}{{sfn|Anthony Hewitt|1993|p=173}}{{sfn|Timothy H.

It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at [[Apollo Bunder]], Mumbai (then Bombay) of [[Emperor of India|King-Emperor]] [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen-Empress Mary]], the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the [[Indo-Saracenic]] style. The final design of the monument by architect [[George Wittet]] was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a [[triumphal arch]] made of [[basalt]], which is {{convert|26|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} high.\n\nAfter its construction the gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to British India for important colonial personnel. It has been called a symbol of \"conquest and colonisation\" commemorating British colonial legacy. The gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel]] and overlooks the [[Arabian Sea]]. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for [[Hanukkah]] celebrations, with the lighting of the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], since 2003. There are five jetties located at the gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.\n\nThe gateway was the site of a [[25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings|terror attack in August 2003]], when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.\n\nIn March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.\n\n==History and significance==\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/1|total_width=200|| align=left|caption_align=left\n| image1 = Gateway of India, Bombay. 1911.JPG|caption1=The gateway, in 1924\n| image2 = Departure of British Troops from India - 28 February 1948 - Gateway of India.jpg|caption2=Departure of the last British troops from the gateway, in 1948}}\nThe gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the [[Delhi Durbar|Delhi Durbar of 1911]]; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.{{sfn|Dup\u00e9e, Jeffrey N.|2008|p=114}}{{sfn|Anthony Hewitt|1993|p=173}}{{sfn|Timothy H.
