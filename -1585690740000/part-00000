He brought the song to the attention of his friend [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]], who then had the Baha Men cover the song. The song became the band's first and only hit in the United Kingdom and the United States, and it gained popularity after appearing in ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' and its soundtrack album.\n\nThe song peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as topping the charts in Australia and New Zealand, and reached the [[Top 40]] in the United States. It was Britain's fourth biggest-selling single of 2000, and went on to become one of the highest-selling singles of the decade not to reach number one. The track went on to win the Grammy for [[Best Dance Recording]] on the [[2001 Grammy Awards]]. The song is the significant part in [[Culture of the Bahamas|Bahamian popular culture]], and was also the subject of a major lawsuit over copyright ownership that was settled.<ref name=\"lawsuit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cananews.net/news/|title=Dog fight over song|author=Staff writer|date=3 November 2000|accessdate=3 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512150556/http://www.cananews.net/news|archivedate=12 May 2010|agency=[[Caribbean News Agency]]|page=Pg. 3|quote=Port of Spain, Trinidad CANA \u2013 A major legal battle in a New York court over the rights to \"Who Let The Dogs Out\" was settled.

Trinidadian soca artiste Anslem Douglas, who was originally credited as the composer of the calypso, found himself at the centre of a battle over rights to the song. Involved was St. Vincent-born musician Ossie Gurley in whose Toronto recording studio the original calypso was created, and two recording labels \u2013 Deston Records and Wingspan Records.

Baha Men member Dyson Knight explained to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' how the band came to record the song:\n\n{{quote|\"The manager of the Baha Men at that time heard a version of the song from Europe. He called [Knight's bandmate] Isaiah [Taylor] and told him it was an absolute must that Baha Men record that song, because they had the vibe to make it a huge hit. Isaiah heard the song and said there was 'no way in hell we're recording that song'...Management had the vision, and the Baha Men were reluctant, but the group went in and recorded it anyway.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-baha-men-will-outlive-us-all-000|title=The Baha Men Will Outlive Us All|last=Hamilton|first=Brandt|date=12 January 2015|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nDouglas himself admitted that the song has nothing to do with dogs and actually has a feminist theme. In an interview that was published on his website, he said: \"It's a man-bashing song. I'll tell you why. The lyric of the song says, 'The party was nice, the party was pumpin'.' When I said the word 'party' I was being metaphorical. It really means things were going great. The 'Yippie-Yi-Yo,' that's everybody's happy, right? 'And everybody was having a ball.' Life was going great. 'Until the men start the name-callin' / And then the girls respond to the call.' So the men started calling the women 'skank' and 'skettel,' every dirty word you can think of. The men started the name-calling and then the girls respond to the call. And then a woman shouts out, 'Who let the dogs out?' And we start calling men dogs. It was really a man-bashing song.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revelist.com/feminism/who-let-the-dogs-out/613|title=What does 'Who Let the Dogs Out' song by Baha Men mean?|last=Velez|first=Mandy|date=24 February 2016|work=Revelist|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>  There are other credible claimants to authorship in Toronto, Miami and sports cheers in general.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Berube |first1=Chris |title=Whomst among us let the dogs out |url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/whomst-among-us-let-the-dogs-out/ |accessdate=18 February 2020 |work=[[99% Invisible]] |date=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe song was incredibly successful in Europe and Oceania, reaching the top spot in Australia and New Zealand, number 2 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Top 5 in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, and the Top 10 in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Belgium. It also reached number 8 in Brazil. Despite this, however, its success initially didn\u2019t translate to the United States, where it only peaked at number 40. It received fame after being used in the soundtrack to ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' and even more so after it became a ubiquitous [[sports anthem]] at stadiums and arenas throughout the world, based largely on the efforts of a sports marketing company hired by the song's producer, [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 2007 poll conducted by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' to identify the 20 most annoying songs, \"Who Let the Dogs Out\" ranked third.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/07/02/the-20-most-annoying-songs/|title=Rolling Stone : The 20 Most Annoying Songs|author=Rolling Stone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215070630/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/07/02/the-20-most-annoying-songs/|archivedate=15 December 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-10-07|df=dmy}}</ref> It was also ranked first on [[Spinner.com|Spinner]]'s 2008 list of \"Top 20 Worst Songs Ever\".<ref>[http://www.spinner.com/2008/08/01/top-20-worst-bad-songs-ever-no-1/ Top 20 Worst Songs Ever], ''Spinner'', 1 August 2008.

Then, the dogs in the video escape from a doggie day care center. The guard, surprised, yells on his walkie-talkie, \"Who let the dogs out?!\" In other parts of the video, the dogs chase people around the same area in which the band is performing. At the end of the video, the dogs can be seen running back to the day care center and the security guard is pleased.\n\nA version exists using the \"Barking Mad Mix\" of the song. This was the main video in Australia (where it was the single version), having been shown on an episode of ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]''.\n\nA new version of the video debuted at the end of the VHS release of ''Rugrats in Paris: The Movie'', where it was re-edited to feature clips of the film throughout. The ''Millionaire'' parody at the beginning is also replaced with the photo shoot scene from the movie.\n\n==Use in sporting events==\nThe first use of the song at an American sporting event was at [[Mississippi State University]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=vXxNuH7tKV8|title=1999 Egg Bowl}}</ref> The university's mascot is the [[Bulldog]], and the university school first played the song during football games in the fall of 1998 using the version sung by Chuck Smooth.

Two days later, shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] requested the song be used as his walk-up music, and it quickly became the Mariners team anthem. The Baha Men performed at [[Safeco Field]] during a Mariners game in September 2000. The [[New York Mets]], however, have claimed that they were the first MLB team to adopt the song, to which [[ESPN|ESPN.com]] humorously commented \"This is a little like scientists arguing over who discovered a deadly virus\". The Baha Men recorded a version of the song that changed the chorus to \"Who let the Mets out?\" and all the lyrics to reflect the team and its players, which was played at [[Shea Stadium]] throughout the Mets' 2000 postseason run, including a live performance on the Shea Stadium field before Game 4 of the [[2000 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]]. The song was written by [[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show#Hosts|David Brody]] of Z100 New York and recorded by the Baha Men initially for Z100. Brody then gave the song to the Mets to play at Shea. Brody has also written songs for the 2006, 2007, and 2015 Mets. [[Richard Hidalgo]] used the original song as his entrance music while playing for the [[Houston Astros]].\n\nThe song is the theme song for Monster Mutt & Monster Mutt Rottweiler while freestyling in [[Monster Jam]]. It was also the first song played at [[Buffalo Blizzard]] games after kickoff for the 2001 [[National Professional Soccer League (1984\u20132001)|NPSL]] season.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song was quickly appropriated by [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] supporters under then-manager [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]]. Regular chants of 'Hou led the reds out' by Liverpool fans (a reference to Liverpool's [[2000\u201301 in English football#Houllier delivers three for Liverpool|cup treble in 2001]]) were followed soon after by opposition fans' chants of 'Hou had a heart attack' (a reference to Houllier's [[G\u00e9rard Houllier#Liverpool|illness in October 2001]]).<ref>{{cite

He brought the song to the attention of his friend [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]], who then had the Baha Men cover the song. The song became the band's first and only hit in the United Kingdom and the United States, and it gained popularity after appearing in ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' and its soundtrack album.\n\nThe song peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as topping the charts in Australia and New Zealand, and reached the [[Top 40]] in the United States. It was Britain's fourth biggest-selling single of 2000, and went on to become one of the highest-selling singles of the decade not to reach number one. The track went on to win the Grammy for [[Best Dance Recording]] on the [[2001 Grammy Awards]].

Trinidadian soca artiste Anslem Douglas, who was originally credited as the composer of the calypso, found himself at the centre of a battle over rights to the song. Involved was St. Vincent-born musician Ossie Gurley in whose Toronto recording studio the original calypso was created, and two recording labels \u2013 Deston Records and Wingspan Records.

Baha Men member Dyson Knight explained to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' how the band came to record the song:\n\n{{quote|\"The manager of the Baha Men at that time heard a version of the song from Europe. He called [Knight's bandmate] Isaiah [Taylor] and told him it was an absolute must that Baha Men record that song, because they had the vibe to make it a huge hit. Isaiah heard the song and said there was 'no way in hell we're recording that song'...Management had the vision, and the Baha Men were reluctant, but the group went in and recorded it anyway.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-baha-men-will-outlive-us-all-000|title=The Baha Men Will Outlive Us All|last=Hamilton|first=Brandt|date=12 January 2015|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nDouglas himself admitted that the song has nothing to do with dogs and actually has a feminist theme. In an interview that was published on his website, he said: \"It's a man-bashing song. I'll tell you why. The lyric of the song says, 'The party was nice, the party was pumpin'.' When I said the word 'party' I was being metaphorical. It really means things were going great. The 'Yippie-Yi-Yo,' that's everybody's happy, right? 'And everybody was having a ball.' Life was going great. 'Until the men start the name-callin' / And then the girls respond to the call.' So the men started calling the women 'skank' and 'skettel,' every dirty word you can think of. The men started the name-calling and then the girls respond to the call. And then a woman shouts out, 'Who let the dogs out?' And we start calling men dogs. It was really a man-bashing song.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revelist.com/feminism/who-let-the-dogs-out/613|title=What does 'Who Let the Dogs Out' song by Baha Men mean?|last=Velez|first=Mandy|date=24 February 2016|work=Revelist|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>  There are other credible claimants to authorship in Toronto, Miami and sports cheers in general.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Berube |first1=Chris |title=Whomst among us let the dogs out |url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/whomst-among-us-let-the-dogs-out/ |accessdate=18 February 2020 |work=[[99% Invisible]] |date=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe song was incredibly successful in Europe and Oceania, reaching the top spot in Australia and New Zealand, number 2 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Top 5 in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, and the Top 10 in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Belgium.

It received fame after being used in the soundtrack to ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' and even more so after it became a ubiquitous [[sports anthem]] at stadiums and arenas throughout the world, based largely on the efforts of a sports marketing company hired by the song's producer, [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 2007 poll conducted by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' to identify the 20 most annoying songs, \"Who Let the Dogs Out\" ranked third.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/07/02/the-20-most-annoying-songs/|title=Rolling Stone : The 20 Most Annoying Songs|author=Rolling Stone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215070630/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/07/02/the-20-most-annoying-songs/|archivedate=15 December 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-10-07|df=dmy}}</ref> It was also ranked first on [[Spinner.com|Spinner]]'s 2008 list of \"Top 20 Worst Songs Ever\".<ref>[http://www.spinner.com/2008/08/01/top-20-worst-bad-songs-ever-no-1/ Top 20 Worst Songs Ever], ''Spinner'', 1 August 2008.

Then, the dogs in the video escape from a doggie day care center. The guard, surprised, yells on his walkie-talkie, \"Who let the dogs out?!\" In other parts of the video, the dogs chase people around the same area in which the band is performing. At the end of the video, the dogs can be seen running back to the day care center and the security guard is pleased.\n\nA version exists using the \"Barking Mad Mix\" of the song. This was the main video in Australia (where it was the single version), having been shown on an episode of ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]''.\n\nA new version of the video debuted at the end of the VHS release of ''Rugrats in Paris: The Movie'', where it was re-edited to feature clips of the film throughout. The ''Millionaire'' parody at the beginning is also replaced with the photo shoot scene from the movie.\n\n==Use in sporting events==\nThe first use of the song at an American sporting event was at [[Mississippi State University]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=vXxNuH7tKV8|title=1999 Egg Bowl}}</ref> The university's mascot is the [[Bulldog]], and the university school first played the song during football games in the fall of 1998 using the version sung by Chuck Smooth.

Two days later, shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] requested the song be used as his walk-up music, and it quickly became the Mariners team anthem. The Baha Men performed at [[Safeco Field]] during a Mariners game in September 2000. The [[New York Mets]], however, have claimed that they were the first MLB team to adopt the song, to which [[ESPN|ESPN.com]] humorously commented \"This is a little like scientists arguing over who discovered a deadly virus\". The Baha Men recorded a version of the song that changed the chorus to \"Who let the Mets out?\" and all the lyrics to reflect the team and its players, which was played at [[Shea Stadium]] throughout the Mets' 2000 postseason run, including a live performance on the Shea Stadium field before Game 4 of the [[2000 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]]. The song was written by [[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show#Hosts|David Brody]] of Z100 New York and recorded by the Baha Men initially for Z100. Brody then gave the song to the Mets to play at Shea. Brody has also written songs for the 2006, 2007, and 2015 Mets. [[Richard Hidalgo]] used the original song as his entrance music while playing for the [[Houston Astros]].\n\nThe song is the theme song for Monster Mutt & Monster Mutt Rottweiler while freestyling in [[Monster Jam]]. It was also the first song played at [[Buffalo Blizzard]] games after kickoff for the 2001 [[National Professional Soccer League (1984\u20132001)|NPSL]] season.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song was quickly appropriated by [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] supporters under then-manager [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]]. Regular chants of 'Hou led the reds out' by Liverpool fans (a reference to Liverpool's [[2000\u201301 in English football#Houllier delivers three for Liverpool|cup treble in 2001]]) were followed soon after by opposition fans' chants of 'Hou had a heart attack' (a reference to Houllier's [[G\u00e9rard Houllier#Liverpool|illness in October 2001]]).<ref>{{cite

Tigray is the homeland of the [[Tigrayan]], [[Irob people|Irob]] and [[Kunama people|Kunama]] peoples.

Tigray is the 6th largest by area, the 5th most populous, and the 5th most densely populated of the 9 [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|Regional States]].\n\nTigray's official language is [[Tigrinya language|Tigrigna]]. Tigray is situated between 12\u00b0&ndash;15\u00b0 N and 36\u00b0 30' &ndash; 40\u00b0 30' E and comprises {{Convert|53638|km2|mi2}}<ref>.{{Cite book|title=Investment Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Tigray Region Investment Office|year=2007|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=}}</ref> Tigray has ca. 9 million inhabitants.

There is also the historically significant town of [[Yeha]].\n\nThe government of Tigray is composed of the executive branch, led by the President; the legislative branch, which comprises the State Council; and the judicial branch, which is led by the state Supreme Court.\n[[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|The [[King Ezana's Stela]] in [[Axum]], [[Tigray region]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Major mountains===\n:* [[Ferrah Imba]], 3939 metres, summit of the [[Tsibet]] massif in [[Endamekoni]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|12|50|34|N|39|31|03|E }}), and highest peak of Tigray\n:* [[Amba Alagi|Imba Alaje]], 3438 metres, in [[Alaje]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|12|59|39|N|39|30|13|E}})\n:* [[Mugulat]], 3263 metres, in [[Ganta Afeshum]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|16|N|39|25|E }}); one of its spurs is crossed by the [[Siqurto foot tunnel]]\n:* Upper plateaus of the [[Atsbi Horst]] at 3057 metres in [[Atsbi Wenberta]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|03|N|39|43|E }})\n:* [[Imba Tsion]], 2917 metres, in [[Hawzen]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|06|N|39|26|E }})\n:* [[Ekli Imba]], 2799 metres, summit of the [[Arebay]] massif in [[Degua Tembien]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|13|43|N|39|16|E }})\n:* [[Amba Aradam|Imba Aradom]] \u2013 sometimes transliterated as [[Amba Aradam]], 2756 metres, in [[Hintalo Wajirat]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|13|20|N|39|31|E }})\n:* [[Soloda]], 2436 metres, part of the [[Adwa plugs]] in [[Adwa]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|11|N|38|54|E }})\n:* [[Imba Neway]], 2388 metres, in [[Abergele (woreda)]]({{coord|13|16|N|38|57|E }})\n\n[[File:Leakage from Gereb Segen dam.jpg|thumb|left|Regularised stream, fed by leakages from Gereb Segen dam. Further down, the farmers use it to expand irrigated land]]\n\n===Water challenge===\nOverall, the region is [[semi-arid]]. The [[rainy season]] lasts only for a couple of months. The farmers are adapted to this, but the problem arises when rains are less than normal. Another major challenge is providing water to urban areas. Smaller towns, but particularly [[Mekelle]], face endemic [[water shortage]]s. [[Reservoirs]] have been built, but their management is sub-optimal.\n\n===Major cities===\n{{Largest cities|name=Largest cities|country=Tigray Region|stat_ref=Source:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Ethiopia.html |title=Tigray (Ethiopia): State, Major Cities, Villages & Places |date=19 February 2011 |publisher=City Population |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref>|list_by_pop=|class=nav|div_name=District|div_link=List of districts in the Tigray Region{{!}}District|city_1=Mekelle|div_1=Enderta (woreda){{!}}Enderta|pop_1=219,818|img_1=|city_2=Adigrat|div_2=Ganta Afeshum|pop_2=76,400|img_2=Adigrat 03.jpg|city_3=Axum|div_3=Laelay Maychew|pop_3=56,500|img_3=Late Afternoon In The Neighborhood, Axum, Ethiopia (3163995792).jpg|city_4=Shire Inda Selassie|div_4=Tahtay Koraro|pop_4=47,284|img_4=|city_5=Humera|div_5=Kafta Humera|pop_5=41,653|city_6=Adwa|div_6=Adwa|pop_6=40,500|city_7=Alamata|div_7=Alamata|pop_7=33,214|city_8=Wukro|div_8=Kelete Awelallo|pop_8=30,210|pop_10=17,045|pop_9=23,419|city_9=Maychew|city_10=Sheraro|div_9=Endamehony|div_10=Tahtay Adiyabo}}\n\n[[Mekelle]] (home of [[Mekelle University]], [[Mekelle Institute of Technology]], Microlink College, Nile College, and Mekelle College of Teacher Education) is the capital of Tigray, near the geographic center of the state.\n\nOther Tigray cities functioning as centers of Ethiopian metropolitan areas include:\n:* [[Adigrat]] (home of [[Adigrat University]], [[Debre Damo|Debre Damo monastery]] and Addis Pharmaceuticals)\n:* [[Adwa]] (home of [[Adwa Pan-African University|Adwa Pan African University]],)\n:* [[Axum]] (home of [[Aksum University]],)\n:* [[Maychew]] (home of [[Raya University]])\n\nOf the 10 largest cities in Tigray, [[Maychew]] has the highest elevation at 2479 meter above sealevel. Plenty of smaller towns, like [[Atsbi]] and [[Idaga Hamus (Saesi Tsaedaemba)|Edaga Hamus]] are located at even higher elevations. Of the large cities, [[Humera]] is located at the lowest altitude (585 m).\n\n===Demographics===\nThe [[population pyramid]] has a wide base, similar to most other [[low-income countries]]. However, the two lower age groups show that the pyramid base has stopped widening; this concerns particularly the group of 0-9 years old with an even more pronounced effect in the group of 0-4 years old, thus indicating a timid onset of a [[demographic transition]]. This may be related to the improved health services and a changing position of women in the society. Indeed, a revised Family Code came into effect in 2000, advocating the principles of [[gender equality]]. This raised the [[minimum age of marriage]] from 15 to 18 years old and established [[women rights]] in terms of sharing any assets the household has accumulated. The [[Ethiopian penal code]] states that it is a crime to beat one's wife, and harmful [[traditional practices]] such as [[early marriage]], [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]] and [[female genital mutilation]] are now also considered to be a crime. Nowadays, almost all children are going to school but girls frequently drop out when they reach the age of 13 to 15 years: schools have no facilities for [[menstrual hygiene]] management and this is a major reason to interrupt schooling.<ref name=\"sociodemographic\">{{cite book |last1=Nyssen |first1=J. |last2=De Rudder |first2=F. |last3=Vlassenroot |first3=K. |last4=Fredu Nega |last5=Azadi |first5=Hossein |title=Socio-demographic profile, food insecurity and food-aid based response.

The capital city of the empire was [[Aksum]], now in northern Ethiopia. Today a smaller community, the city of Aksum was once a bustling metropolis, cultural and economic center. Two hills and two streams lie on the east and west expanses of the city; perhaps providing the initial impetus for settling this area. Along the hills and plain outside the city, the Aksumites had cemeteries with elaborate grave stones called [[stelae]], or [[obelisk]]s. Other important cities included [[Yeha]], [[Hawulti-Melazo]], [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]], [[Adulis]], and [[Qohaito]], the last three of which are now in Eritrea. By the reign of [[Endubis]] in the late 3rd century, it had begun minting its own currency and was named by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] as one of the four great powers of his time along with [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[History of China|China]]. It converted to [[Christianity]] in 325 or 328 under [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]] and was the first state ever to use the image of the cross on its coins.<ref>http://users.clas.ufl.edu/sterk/junsem/haas.pdf</ref><ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/15</ref>\n[[File:Ousas.jpg|thumb|Aksumite gold coins.]]\n===11th to 19th century AD===\nIn the 14th century the Tigrinya-speaking lands (Tigray-Mereb Melash) were divided into two provinces, separated by the Mereb River by the newly enthroned Amhara Emperors. The governor of the northern province received the title Bahre Negash (Ruler of the sea), whereas the governor of the southern province was given the title of Tigray Mekonen (Lord of Tigray). The Portuguese Jesuit, Emanuele Baradas' work titled \"Do reino de Tigr\" and written in 1633-34 states that the \"reino de Tigr\" extended from Hamasien to Temben, from the borders of Dankel to the Adwa mountain. He also stated that Tigray-Mereb Melash was divided into twenty-four smaller political units (principalities), twelve of which were located south of the Mereb and governed by the Tigray Mekonen based in Enderta.<ref name=\"Richard M. Trivelli 1998 pg 259\">Richard M.

Trivelli 1998 pg 259\" />\n\nThe ''Book of Aksum'', written and compiled probably before the 15th century, shows a traditional schematic map of Tigray with the city of [[Aksum]] at its center surrounded by the 13 principal provinces: \"Tembien, Shire, [[Serae]], [[Hamasien]], [[Buri province|Bur]], Sam\u2019a, Agame, Amba Senayt, [[Gar'alta|Garalta]], Enderta, Sahart and Abergele.\"<ref>[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], ''History of Ethiopian Towns'' (Wiesbaden; Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 201.</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the position of [[Tigray Mekonnen]] (\"Governor of Tigray\") was established to rule over the area. Other districts included [[Akkele Guzay|Akele Guzay]] (now part of [[Eritrea]]), and the kingdom of the [[Bahr negus]], who ruled much of what is now Eritrea and [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] district and town in Western Tigray. At the time when Tigray Mekonnen existed simultaneously with that of Bahr negus, their frontier seems to have been the [[Mareb River]], which is currently constitutes the border between the Ethiopian province of Tigray and Eritrea.\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img26 Atse Yohannes Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Mekelle]] palace of Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] (emperor of the whole [[Ethiopian Empire]]).]]\nAfter the loss of power of the Bahr negus in the aftermath of [[Bahr negus Yeshaq]]'s rebellions, the title of Tigray mekonnen gained power in relation to the Bahr negus and at times included ruling over parts of what is now Eritrea, especially in the 19th century.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia'' (London: Lalibela House, 1962), p. 328</ref> By the unsettled [[Zemene Mesafint]] period (\"Era of the Princes\"), both titles had sunken to little more than empty titles, and the Lord who in his turn dominated the region, used (and received from Emperor) the title of either [[Ras (title)|Ras]] or [[Dejazmach]], beginning with Ras [[Mikael Sehul]]. Rulers of Tigray such as Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] alternated with others, chiefly those of [[Begemder]] or [[Yejju]], as warlords to rule in fact the Ethiopian monarchy during the Zemene Mesafint.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the lords of Tembien and Enderta managed to create an overlordship of Tigray to their dynasty. One of its members, Dejazmach Kahsay Mercha, ascended the imperial throne in 1872 under the name [[Yohannes IV]]. Following his death in the [[Battle of Metemma]], the Ethiopian throne came under the control of the king of [[Shewa]], and the center of power shifted south and away from Tigray.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1943, open resistance broke out all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, \"there is no government; let's organize and govern ourselves.\"  Throughout Enderta awraja including, [[Mekelle]], Didibadergiajen, [[Hintalo]], Saharti, [[Samre, Ethiopia|Samre]] and Wajirat, Raya awraja, Kilte-Awlaelo awraja and Tembien awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were immediately formed. The gerren sent representatives to a central congress, called the shengo, which elected leaders and established a military command system. Although the Woyane rebellion of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians, however, agree that the Woyane rebellion had involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative. It demonstrated considerable popular participation and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was unequivocally and specifically directed against the central Shoan Amhara regime of Haile Selassie I, rather than the Tigrayan imperial elite.\n\n====Ethiopian Civil War====\nAfter the February 1974 popular revolution, the first signal of any mass uprising was the actions of the soldiers of the 4th Brigade of the 4th Army Division in Nagelle in southern Ethiopia. The Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the Derg ([[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] \"Committee\"), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers. The committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman. In July the Derg obtained key concessions from the emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers but government officials at every level. Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]] and [[Endelkachew Makonnen|Endalkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court were imprisoned. In August, after a proposed constitution creating a constitutional monarchy was presented to the emperor, the Derg began a program of dismantling the imperial government in order to forestall further developments in that direction. The Derg deposed and imprisoned the emperor on September 12, 1974. In addition, the Derg in 1975 nationalized most industries and private and somewhat secure urban real-estate holdings.\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img15 Martyrs Memorial.jpg|thumb|304x304px|Martyrs' Memorial in Mekelle.]]\nBut mismanagement, corruption, and general hostility to the Derg's violent rule, coupled with the draining effects of constant warfare with the separatist guerrilla movements in Tigray, led to a drastic fall in general productivity of food and cash crops. In October 1978 the Derg announced the National Revolutionary Development Campaign to mobilize human and material resources to transform the economy, which led to a Ten-Year Plan (1984/85-1993/94) to expand agricultural and industrial output, forecasting a 6.5% growth in GDP and a 3.6% rise in per capita income. Instead per capita income declined 0.8% over this period. Famine scholar [[Alex de Waal]] observes that while the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|famine]] that struck the country in the mid-1980s is usually ascribed to drought, \"closer investigation shows that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was already under way.\" Hundreds of thousands fled economic misery, conscription, and political repression, and went to live in neighboring countries and all over the [[Western world]], creating an Ethiopian [[diaspora]] for the first time.\n\nA civil war took place that left many deads.\n[[File:Nest box for Columba guinea in Zerfenti.jpg|thumb|left|Nest box for ''Columba guinea'' (considered a peace bird) in the wall of a homestead in [[Zerfenti]], a village in Tigray where hundreds were killed by Derg bombings]]\n\nTowards the end of January 1991, a coalition of rebel forces, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) captured [[Gondar]], the ancient capital city, [[Bahar Dar]], and [[Dessie]].\n\n====Postwar====\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], although the area which became the Tigray Region was thought by the rest of Ethiopia to be the beneficiaries of enormous funds from an [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) government dominated by fellow Tigrayans, in reality the beneficiaries are mostly the members of the Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF). John Young, who visited the area several times in the early 1990s, attributes this delay in part to \"Budgetary restraints, structural readjustments, and lack of awareness in [[Addis Ababa]] of conditions in the province\", but notes \"an equally significant obstacle was posed by an entrenched, and largely Amhara dominated central bureaucracy which used its power to block even authorised funds from reaching all regions.\" At the same time a growing urban middle class of traders, businessmen and government officials emerged that was suspicious of and distant from the victorious EPRDF. The ruling party attempted to address these challenges in forums with its middle-class critics, as well as by establishing a number of charitable [[non-governmental organization]]s controlled by the EPRDF, including the Endowment Fund for the Rehabilitation of Tigray, [[Relief Society of Tigray]], and Tigray Development Association.\nIn 1998 [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|war erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia]] over a portion of territory that had been administered as part of Tigray, which included the town of [[Badme]]. Following a 2002 [[United Nations]] decision, much of this land was awarded to Eritrea, but so far Ethiopia has refused to implement the final and binding ruling, and as a result relations with Eritrea are very tense.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2001 the president of Tigray was Gebru Asrat and from 2001 to 2010 the president was Tsegay Berhe.\n\n==Agriculture==\n[[File:Inda Abba Hadera forest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gestet]] forest]]\n[[File:Crop harvesting in Khunale.jpg|thumb|Crop harvesting in [[Khunale]]]]\n===Cropping===\n====Terracing and dam construction====\nAn important aspect of the agricultural work in Tigray after the end of the 1991 civil war was to minimize the problems of drought. In the past, the Tigray was covered with forests and had a micro-climate that favored the rains. Subsequently, the forests were cut down, usually to impoverish the population during the wars. Consequently, the Tigray achieved a fair amount of rainfall during the rainy season, from August to September, but quickly lost these waters downstream. In the process the fertile soil of the fields eroded, which gave the Blue Nile its characteristic color. After a few weeks of rain, the country again dried up.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe government undertook two projects in Tigray. The first was the construction of terraces which, with the agreement and help of local communities, go up to the tops of the mountains at 2,500 meters. The goal was to prevent the rainfall flowing away immediately so that it could be conserved for the agricultural season. On the highest terraces were planted trees, mainly [[eucalyptus]], the dominant tree in Ethiopia and native to [[Australia]]. These plants created a new microclimate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/sites/default/files/aasr-2014climate-change-and-smallholder-agriculture-in-ssa.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801051500/https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/sites/default/files/aasr-2014climate-change-and-smallholder-agriculture-in-ssa.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Image:Misty Morning near Endaselassie.JPG|thumb|Mountains of Lemalimo near [[Inda Selassie]] in western Tigray]]\n\nThe terracing method was very simple but required good organization. Long stretches of the fields were terraced by the villagers using stone walls from stones that erosion had brought to light. The rains eroding the still non-terraced ground formed mudslides that were held by the topmost walls, which permitted construction of a new terrace field and another wall with uncovered stones, creating new ground terraced farmland every year.\n\nFour or five years after the project commenced, almost all of Tigray, with an area only slightly less than Italy's, was terraced.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:2. Addi Amharay.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addi Amharay]] reservoir]]\nAnother endeavour involved the construction of small reservoirs for local irrigation. As rains last only for a couple of months per year, reservoirs of different sizes allow harvesting runoff from the rainy season for further use in the dry season. The dams needed to create these basins are typically an embankment of a few hundreds of meters, closing off one part of a valley, with a maximum height of 20 meters. Each took months of work, in which people carried earth on their back, and with assistance of donkeys. Generally 2,000-3,000 people\u2014men, women and children\u2014carried the earth in simple baskets.{{cn|date=December 2019}} \nThe small reservoirs in Tigray include\n{|\n|\n* [[Addi Abagi\u00e8]]\n* [[Addi Akhor]]\n* [[Addi Amharay]]\n* [[May Leiba]]\n* [[Hiza'iti Wedi Cheber]]\n* [[Addi Asme'e]]\n* [[Chini]]\n* [[Addi Gela]]\n* [[Addi Hilo]]\n* [[Addi Qenafiz]]\n| WIDTH=\"63\" | ||\n* [[Addi Shihu]]\n* [[Aqushela]]\n* [[Arato]]\n* [[Belesat]]\n* [[Betqua]]\n* [[Chichat]]\n* [[Dibdibo]]\n* [[Dur Anbesa]]\n* [[Imbagedo]]\n* [[Inda Zib'i]]\n| WIDTH=\"63\" | ||\n* [[Era (reservoir)]]\n* [[Era Quhila]]\n* [[Gereb Mihiz]]\n* [[Filiglig]]\n* [[Gereb May Zib'i]]\n* [[Gereb Bi'ati]]\n* [[Gereb Awso]]\n* [[Felaga]]\n* [[Gereb Segen (Hintalo)]]\n* [[Gereb Segen (May Gabat)]]\n| WIDTH=\"63\" | ||\n* [[Gereb Shegal]]\n* [[Ginda'i]]\n* [[Godew]]\n|}\nOverall, these reservoirs suffer from rapid [[siltation]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vanmaercke|first1=M. and colleagues |title=Geo-trekking in Ethiopia's Tropical Mountains |chapter=Sediment Yield and Reservoir Siltation in Tigray |date=2019 |publisher=Springer Nature |location=Cham (CH) |pages=345\u2013357|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04955-3_23 |series=GeoGuide |isbn=978-3-030-04954-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nigussie Haregeweyn |first1=and colleagues |title=Reservoirs in Tigray: characteristics and sediment deposition problems |journal=Land Degradation and Development |date=2006 |volume=17 |pages=211\u2013230 |doi=10.1002/ldr.698 }}</ref> Part of the water that could be used for irrigation is lost through [[seepage]]; the positive side-effect is that this contributes to [[groundwater recharge]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nigussie Haregeweyn |first1=and colleagues |title=Sediment yield variability in Northern Ethiopia: A quantitative analysis of its controlling factors |journal=Catena |date=2008 |volume=75 |pages=65\u201376 |doi=10.1016/j.catena.2008.04.011 }}</ref>\n\n====Vegetation and exclosures====\nTigray holds numerous [[exclosure]]s, areas that are set aside for regreening.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aerts |first1=R |last2=Nyssen |first2=J|author3-link=Mitiku Haile |last3=Mitiku Haile |title= On the difference between \"exclosures\" and \"enclosures\" in ecology and the environment |journal=Journal of Arid Environments |date=2009|volume=73 |issue=8 |pages= 762\u2013763 |doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.01.006 }}</ref> Wood harvesting and livestock range are not allowed there.

Tigray is the 6th largest by area, the 5th most populous, and the 5th most densely populated of the 9 [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|Regional States]].\n\nTigray's official language is [[Tigrinya language|Tigrigna]]. Tigray is situated between 12\u00b0&ndash;15\u00b0 N and 36\u00b0 30' &ndash; 40\u00b0 30' E and comprises {{Convert|53638|km2|mi2}}<ref>.{{Cite book|title=Investment Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Tigray Region Investment Office|year=2007|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=}}</ref> Tigray has ca. 5 million inhabitants.

The highlands (11.5% {{IPA|d\u0259g\u02b7\u0259a}}, 40.5% {{IPA|w\u00e4yna d\u00e4ga}}) have the highest population density, specially in eastern and central Tigray.

There is also the historically significant town of [[Yeha]].\n\nThe government of Tigray is composed of the executive branch, led by the President; the legislative branch, which comprises the State Council; and the judicial branch, which is led by the state Supreme Court.\n[[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|The [[King Ezana's Stela]] in [[Axum]], [[Tigray region]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Major mountains===\n:* [[Ferrah Imba]], 3939 metres, summit of the [[Tsibet]] massif in [[Endamekoni]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|12|50|34|N|39|31|03|E }}), and highest peak of Tigray\n:* [[Amba Alagi|Imba Alaje]], 3438 metres, in [[Alaje]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|12|59|39|N|39|30|13|E}})\n:* [[Mugulat]], 3263 metres, in [[Ganta Afeshum]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|16|N|39|25|E }}); one of its spurs is crossed by the [[Siqurto foot tunnel]]\n:* Upper plateaus of the [[Atsbi Horst]] at 3057 metres in [[Atsbi Wenberta]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|03|N|39|43|E }})\n:* [[Imba Tsion]], 2917 metres, in [[Hawzen]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|06|N|39|26|E }})\n:* [[Ekli Imba]], 2799 metres, summit of the [[Arebay]] massif in [[Degua Tembien]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|13|43|N|39|16|E }})\n:* [[Amba Aradam|Imba Aradom]] \u2013 sometimes transliterated as [[Amba Aradam]], 2756 metres, in [[Hintalo Wajirat]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|13|20|N|39|31|E }})\n:* [[Soloda]], 2436 metres, part of the [[Adwa plugs]] in [[Adwa]] ''woreda'' ({{coord|14|11|N|38|54|E }})\n:* [[Imba Neway]], 2388 metres, in [[Abergele (woreda)]]({{coord|13|16|N|38|57|E }})\n\n[[File:Leakage from Gereb Segen dam.jpg|thumb|left|Regularised stream, fed by leakages from Gereb Segen dam. Further down, the farmers use it to expand irrigated land]]\n\n===Water challenge===\nOverall, the region is [[semi-arid]]. The [[rainy season]] lasts only for a couple of months. The farmers are adapted to this, but the problem arises when rains are less than normal. Another major challenge is providing water to urban areas. Smaller towns, but particularly [[Mekelle]], face endemic [[water shortage]]s. [[Reservoirs]] have been built, but their management is sub-optimal.\n\n===Major cities===\n{{Largest cities|name=Largest cities|country=Tigray Region|stat_ref=Source:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Ethiopia.html |title=Tigray (Ethiopia): State, Major Cities, Villages & Places |date=19 February 2011 |publisher=City Population |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref>|list_by_pop=|class=nav|div_name=District|div_link=List of districts in the Tigray Region{{!}}District|city_1=Mekelle|div_1=Enderta (woreda){{!}}Enderta|pop_1=219,818|img_1=|city_2=Adigrat|div_2=Ganta Afeshum|pop_2=76,400|img_2=Adigrat 03.jpg|city_3=Axum|div_3=Laelay Maychew|pop_3=56,500|img_3=Late Afternoon In The Neighborhood, Axum, Ethiopia (3163995792).jpg|city_4=Shire Inda Selassie|div_4=Tahtay Koraro|pop_4=47,284|img_4=|city_5=Humera|div_5=Kafta Humera|pop_5=41,653|city_6=Adwa|div_6=Adwa|pop_6=40,500|city_7=Alamata|div_7=Alamata|pop_7=33,214|city_8=Wukro|div_8=Kelete Awelallo|pop_8=30,210|pop_10=17,045|pop_9=23,419|city_9=Maychew|city_10=Sheraro|div_9=Endamehony|div_10=Tahtay Adiyabo}}\n\n[[Mekelle]] (home of [[Mekelle University]], [[Mekelle Institute of Technology]], Microlink College, Nile College, and Mekelle College of Teacher Education) is the capital of Tigray, near the geographic center of the state.\n\nOther Tigray cities functioning as centers of Ethiopian metropolitan areas include:\n:* [[Adigrat]] (home of [[Adigrat University]], [[Debre Damo|Debre Damo monastery]] and Addis Pharmaceuticals)\n:* [[Adwa]] (home of [[Adwa Pan-African University|Adwa Pan African University]],)\n:* [[Axum]] (home of [[Aksum University]],)\n:* [[Maychew]] (home of [[Raya University]])\n\nOf the 10 largest cities in Tigray, [[Maychew]] has the highest elevation at 2479 meter above sealevel. Plenty of smaller towns, like [[Atsbi]] and [[Idaga Hamus (Saesi Tsaedaemba)|Edaga Hamus]] are located at even higher elevations. Of the large cities, [[Humera]] is located at the lowest altitude (585 m).\n\n===Demographics===\nThe [[population pyramid]] has a wide base, similar to most other [[low-income countries]]. However, the two lower age groups show that the pyramid base has stopped widening; this concerns particularly the group of 0-9 years old with an even more pronounced effect in the group of 0-4 years old, thus indicating a timid onset of a [[demographic transition]]. This may be related to the improved health services and a changing position of women in the society. Indeed, a revised Family Code came into effect in 2000, advocating the principles of [[gender equality]]. This raised the [[minimum age of marriage]] from 15 to 18 years old and established [[women rights]] in terms of sharing any assets the household has accumulated. The [[Ethiopian penal code]] states that it is a crime to beat one's wife, and harmful [[traditional practices]] such as [[early marriage]], [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]] and [[female genital mutilation]] are now also considered to be a crime. Nowadays, almost all children are going to school but girls frequently drop out when they reach the age of 13 to 15 years: schools have no facilities for [[menstrual hygiene]] management and this is a major reason to interrupt schooling.<ref name=\"sociodemographic\">{{cite book |last1=Nyssen |first1=J. |last2=De Rudder |first2=F. |last3=Vlassenroot |first3=K. |last4=Fredu Nega |last5=Azadi |first5=Hossein |title=Socio-demographic profile, food insecurity and food-aid based response.

The capital city of the empire was [[Aksum]], now in northern Ethiopia. Today a smaller community, the city of Aksum was once a bustling metropolis, cultural and economic center. Two hills and two streams lie on the east and west expanses of the city; perhaps providing the initial impetus for settling this area. Along the hills and plain outside the city, the Aksumites had cemeteries with elaborate grave stones called [[stelae]], or [[obelisk]]s. Other important cities included [[Yeha]], [[Hawulti-Melazo]], [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]], [[Adulis]], and [[Qohaito]], the last three of which are now in Eritrea. By the reign of [[Endubis]] in the late 3rd century, it had begun minting its own currency and was named by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] as one of the four great powers of his time along with [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[History of China|China]]. It converted to [[Christianity]] in 325 or 328 under [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]] and was the first state ever to use the image of the cross on its coins.<ref>http://users.clas.ufl.edu/sterk/junsem/haas.pdf</ref><ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/15</ref>\n[[File:Ousas.jpg|thumb|Aksumite gold coins.]]\n===11th to 19th century AD===\nIn the 14th century the Tigrinya-speaking lands (Tigray-Mereb Melash) were divided into two provinces, separated by the Mereb River by the newly enthroned Amhara Emperors. The governor of the northern province received the title Bahre Negash (Ruler of the sea), whereas the governor of the southern province was given the title of Tigray Mekonen (Lord of Tigray). The Portuguese Jesuit, Emanuele Baradas' work titled \"Do reino de Tigr\" and written in 1633-34 states that the \"reino de Tigr\" extended from Hamasien to Temben, from the borders of Dankel to the Adwa mountain. He also stated that Tigray-Mereb Melash was divided into twenty-four smaller political units (principalities), twelve of which were located south of the Mereb and governed by the Tigray Mekonen based in Enderta.<ref name=\"Richard M. Trivelli 1998 pg 259\">Richard M.

Trivelli 1998 pg 259\" />\n\nThe ''Book of Aksum'', written and compiled probably before the 15th century, shows a traditional schematic map of Tigray with the city of [[Aksum]] at its center surrounded by the 13 principal provinces: \"Tembien, Shire, [[Serae]], [[Hamasien]], [[Buri province|Bur]], Sam\u2019a, Agame, Amba Senayt, [[Gar'alta|Garalta]], Enderta, Sahart and Abergele.\"<ref>[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], ''History of Ethiopian Towns'' (Wiesbaden; Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 201.</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the position of [[Tigray Mekonnen]] (\"Governor of Tigray\") was established to rule over the area. Other districts included [[Akkele Guzay|Akele Guzay]] (now part of [[Eritrea]]), and the kingdom of the [[Bahr negus]], who ruled much of what is now Eritrea and [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] district and town in Western Tigray. At the time when Tigray Mekonnen existed simultaneously with that of Bahr negus, their frontier seems to have been the [[Mareb River]], which is currently constitutes the border between the Ethiopian province of Tigray and Eritrea.\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img26 Atse Yohannes Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Mekelle]] palace of Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] (emperor of the whole [[Ethiopian Empire]]).]]\nAfter the loss of power of the Bahr negus in the aftermath of [[Bahr negus Yeshaq]]'s rebellions, the title of Tigray mekonnen gained power in relation to the Bahr negus and at times included ruling over parts of what is now Eritrea, especially in the 19th century.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia'' (London: Lalibela House, 1962), p. 328</ref> By the unsettled [[Zemene Mesafint]] period (\"Era of the Princes\"), both titles had sunken to little more than empty titles, and the Lord who in his turn dominated the region, used (and received from Emperor) the title of either [[Ras (title)|Ras]] or [[Dejazmach]], beginning with Ras [[Mikael Sehul]]. Rulers of Tigray such as Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] alternated with others, chiefly those of [[Begemder]] or [[Yejju]], as warlords to rule in fact the Ethiopian monarchy during the Zemene Mesafint.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the lords of Tembien and Enderta managed to create an overlordship of Tigray to their dynasty. One of its members, Dejazmach Kahsay Mercha, ascended the imperial throne in 1872 under the name [[Yohannes IV]]. Following his death in the [[Battle of Metemma]], the Ethiopian throne came under the control of the king of [[Shewa]], and the center of power shifted south and away from Tigray.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1943, open resistance broke out all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, \"there is no government; let's organize and govern ourselves.\"  Throughout Enderta awraja including, [[Mekelle]], Didibadergiajen, [[Hintalo]], Saharti, [[Samre, Ethiopia|Samre]] and Wajirat, Raya awraja, Kilte-Awlaelo awraja and Tembien awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were immediately formed. The gerren sent representatives to a central congress, called the shengo, which elected leaders and established a military command system. Although the Woyane rebellion of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians, however, agree that the Woyane rebellion had involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative. It demonstrated considerable popular participation and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was unequivocally and specifically directed against the central Shoan Amhara regime of Haile Selassie I, rather than the Tigrayan imperial elite.\n\n====Ethiopian Civil War====\nAfter the February 1974 popular revolution, the first signal of any mass uprising was the actions of the soldiers of the 4th Brigade of the 4th Army Division in Nagelle in southern Ethiopia. The Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the Derg ([[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] \"Committee\"), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers. The committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman. In July the Derg obtained key concessions from the emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers but government officials at every level. Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]] and [[Endelkachew Makonnen|Endalkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court were imprisoned. In August, after a proposed constitution creating a constitutional monarchy was presented to the emperor, the Derg began a program of dismantling the imperial government in order to forestall further developments in that direction. The Derg deposed and imprisoned the emperor on September 12, 1974. In addition, the Derg in 1975 nationalized most industries and private and somewhat secure urban real-estate holdings.\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img15 Martyrs Memorial.jpg|thumb|304x304px|Martyrs' Memorial in Mekelle.]]\nBut mismanagement, corruption, and general hostility to the Derg's violent rule, coupled with the draining effects of constant warfare with the separatist guerrilla movements in Tigray, led to a drastic fall in general productivity of food and cash crops. In October 1978 the Derg announced the National Revolutionary Development Campaign to mobilize human and material resources to transform the economy, which led to a Ten-Year Plan (1984/85-1993/94) to expand agricultural and industrial output, forecasting a 6.5% growth in GDP and a 3.6% rise in per capita income. Instead per capita income declined 0.8% over this period. Famine scholar [[Alex de Waal]] observes that while the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|famine]] that struck the country in the mid-1980s is usually ascribed to drought, \"closer investigation shows that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was already under way.\" Hundreds of thousands fled economic misery, conscription, and political repression, and went to live in neighboring countries and all over the [[Western world]], creating an Ethiopian [[diaspora]] for the first time.\n\nA civil war took place that left many deads.\n[[File:Nest box for Columba guinea in Zerfenti.jpg|thumb|left|Nest box for ''Columba guinea'' (considered a peace bird) in the wall of a homestead in [[Zerfenti]], a village in Tigray where hundreds were killed by Derg bombings]]\n\nTowards the end of January 1991, a coalition of rebel forces, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) captured [[Gondar]], the ancient capital city, [[Bahar Dar]], and [[Dessie]].\n\n====Postwar====\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], although the area which became the Tigray Region was thought by the rest of Ethiopia to be the beneficiaries of enormous funds from an [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) government dominated by fellow Tigrayans, in reality the beneficiaries are mostly the members of the Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF). John Young, who visited the area several times in the early 1990s, attributes this delay in part to \"Budgetary restraints, structural readjustments, and lack of awareness in [[Addis Ababa]] of conditions in the province\", but notes \"an equally significant obstacle was posed by an entrenched, and largely Amhara dominated central bureaucracy which used its power to block even authorised funds from reaching all regions.\" At the same time a growing urban middle class of traders, businessmen and government officials emerged that was suspicious of and distant from the victorious EPRDF. The ruling party attempted to address these challenges in forums with its middle-class critics, as well as by establishing a number of charitable [[non-governmental organization]]s controlled by the EPRDF, including the Endowment Fund for the Rehabilitation of Tigray, [[Relief Society of Tigray]], and Tigray Development Association.\nIn 1998 [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|war erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia]] over a portion of territory that had been administered as part of Tigray, which included the town of [[Badme]]. Following a 2002 [[United Nations]] decision, much of this land was awarded to Eritrea, but so far Ethiopia has refused to implement the final and binding ruling, and as a result relations with Eritrea are very tense.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2001 the president of Tigray was Gebru Asrat and from 2001 to 2010 the president was Tsegay Berhe.\n\n==Agriculture==\n[[File:Inda Abba Hadera forest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gestet]] forest]]\n[[File:Crop harvesting in Khunale.jpg|thumb|Crop harvesting in [[Khunale]]]]\n===Cropping===\n====Terracing and dam construction====\nAn important aspect of the agricultural work in Tigray after the end of the 1991 civil war was to minimize the problems of drought. In the past, the Tigray was covered with forests and had a micro-climate that favored the rains. Subsequently, the forests were cut down, usually to impoverish the population during the wars. Consequently, the Tigray achieved a fair amount of rainfall during the rainy season, from August to September, but quickly lost these waters downstream. In the process the fertile soil of the fields eroded, which gave the Blue Nile its characteristic color. After a few weeks of rain, the country again dried up.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe government undertook two projects in Tigray. The first was the construction of terraces which, with the agreement and help of local communities, go up to the tops of the mountains at 2,500 meters. The goal was to prevent the rainfall flowing away immediately so that it could be conserved for the agricultural season. On the highest terraces were planted trees, mainly [[eucalyptus]], the dominant tree in Ethiopia and native to [[Australia]]. These plants created a new microclimate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/sites/default/files/aasr-2014climate-change-and-smallholder-agriculture-in-ssa.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801051500/https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/sites/default/files/aasr-2014climate-change-and-smallholder-agriculture-in-ssa.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Image:Misty Morning near Endaselassie.JPG|thumb|Mountains of Lemalimo near [[Inda Selassie]] in western Tigray]]\n\nThe terracing method was very simple but required good organization. Long stretches of the fields were terraced by the villagers using stone walls from stones that erosion had brought to light. The rains eroding the still non-terraced ground formed mudslides that were held by the topmost walls, which permitted construction of a new terrace field and another wall with uncovered stones, creating new ground terraced farmland every year.\n\nFour or five years after the project commenced, almost all of Tigray, with an area only slightly less than Italy's, was terraced.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:2. Addi Amharay.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addi Amharay]] reservoir]]\nAnother endeavour involved the construction of small reservoirs for local irrigation. As rains last only for a couple of months per year, reservoirs of different sizes allow harvesting runoff from the rainy season for further use in the dry season. The dams needed to create these basins are typically an embankment of a few hundreds of meters, closing off one part of a valley, with a maximum height of 20 meters. Each took months of work, in which people carried earth on their back, and with assistance of donkeys. Generally 2,000-3,000 people\u2014men, women and children\u2014carried the earth in simple baskets.{{cn|date=December 2019}} \nThe small reservoirs in Tigray include\n{|\n|\n* [[Addi Abagi\u00e8]]\n* [[Addi Akhor]]\n* [[Addi Amharay]]\n* [[May Leiba]]\n* [[Hiza'iti Wedi Cheber]]\n* [[Addi Asme'e]]\n* [[Chini]]\n* [[Addi Gela]]\n* [[Addi Hilo]]\n* [[Addi Qenafiz]]\n| WIDTH=\"63\" | ||\n* [[Addi Shihu]]\n* [[Aqushela]]\n* [[Arato]]\n* [[Belesat]]\n* [[Betqua]]\n* [[Chichat]]\n* [[Dibdibo]]\n* [[Dur Anbesa]]\n* [[Imbagedo]]\n* [[Inda Zib'i]]\n| WIDTH=\"63\" | ||\n* [[Era (reservoir)]]\n* [[Era Quhila]]\n* [[Gereb Mihiz]]\n* [[Filiglig]]\n* [[Gereb May Zib'i]]\n* [[Gereb Bi'ati]]\n* [[Gereb Awso]]\n* [[Felaga]]\n* [[Gereb Segen (Hintalo)]]\n* [[Gereb Segen (May Gabat)]]\n| WIDTH=\"63\" | ||\n* [[Gereb Shegal]]\n* [[Ginda'i]]\n* [[Godew]]\n|}\nOverall, these reservoirs suffer from rapid [[siltation]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vanmaercke|first1=M. and colleagues |title=Geo-trekking in Ethiopia's Tropical Mountains |chapter=Sediment Yield and Reservoir Siltation in Tigray |date=2019 |publisher=Springer Nature |location=Cham (CH) |pages=345\u2013357|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04955-3_23 |series=GeoGuide |isbn=978-3-030-04954-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nigussie Haregeweyn |first1=and colleagues |title=Reservoirs in Tigray: characteristics and sediment deposition problems |journal=Land Degradation and Development |date=2006 |volume=17 |pages=211\u2013230 |doi=10.1002/ldr.698 }}</ref> Part of the water that could be used for irrigation is lost through [[seepage]]; the positive side-effect is that this contributes to [[groundwater recharge]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nigussie Haregeweyn |first1=and colleagues |title=Sediment yield variability in Northern Ethiopia: A quantitative analysis of its controlling factors |journal=Catena |date=2008 |volume=75 |pages=65\u201376 |doi=10.1016/j.catena.2008.04.011 }}</ref>\n\n====Vegetation and exclosures====\nTigray holds numerous [[exclosure]]s, areas that are set aside for regreening.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aerts |first1=R |last2=Nyssen |first2=J|author3-link=Mitiku Haile |last3=Mitiku Haile |title= On the difference between \"exclosures\" and \"enclosures\" in ecology and the environment |journal=Journal of Arid Environments |date=2009|volume=73 |issue=8 |pages= 762\u2013763 |doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.01.006 }}</ref> Wood harvesting and livestock range are not allowed there.

The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded ''Vitalogy'' while touring behind its previous album ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other elements making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album to date.\n\nThe album was first released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], followed by a release on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until [[Jack White]]'s 2014 album ''[[Lazaretto (album)|Lazaretto]]'' it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.<ref name=\"billboard6-18-2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6121606/jack-white-lazaretto-debuts-billboard-200-sets-vinyl-sales-record |title=Jack White's 'Lazaretto' Debuts at No. 1, Sets Vinyl Sales Record |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> Upon its CD release, ''Vitalogy'' became the second-fastest selling album in history, only behind the band's previous release ''Vs.'', selling 877,000 copies in its first week and went multi-platinum quickly.<ref name=\"latimes12-15-1994\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-15/entertainment/ca-9311_1_pearl-jam |title=Vitalogy' Makes for a Real Pearl Jam of a Seller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Philips |first=Chuck |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=December 15, 1994}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.

The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its [[Vs. Tour]] and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Tremor Christ]]\" and \"[[Nothingman]]\".<ref name=\"musician\">Garbarini, Vic. \"Mother of Pearl\".

Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said, \"''Vitalogy'' was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Bassist [[Jeff Ament]] said that \"communication was at an all-time low\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] stated that the communication problems started once guitarist [[Stone Gossard]] stopped acting as the band's mediator.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> According to Gossard, ''Vitalogy'' was the first album in which lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] made the final decisions.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band.<ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. December 22, 1996.</ref> Gossard said that the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of [[jam session]]s. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\"<ref name=\"musician\"/> During the production of ''Vitalogy'', lead guitarist [[Mike McCready]] went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/><ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\nDrums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\".<ref>Reynolds, John, et al. [http://www.twofeetthick.com/2005/05/who-is-the-drummer-on-satans-bed/ \"Who is the drummer on \"Satan's Bed\"?\"]. TwoFeetThick.com. May 12, 2005.</ref> Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for ''Vitalogy'', Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Gossard said, \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> [[Jack Irons]], the original drummer for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said, \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making ''Vitalogy''. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Better_Man.ogg\n |title        = \"Better Man\"\n |description  = A sample of \"Better Man\", from ''Vitalogy''. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and rejected it from the band's previous album ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.

The lyrics for the song have been claimed by some to be about Kurt Cobain; however, Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train\".\n}}\nIn a 1995 interview, ''[[Guitar World]]'' writer Jeff Gilbert described ''Vitalogy'' as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying, \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/> During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, \"''Vitalogy'' is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more [[Punk rock|punk]] feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, \"''Vitalogy'' is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.\"<ref name=\"guitar world\"/>\n\n[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|title=''Vitalogy'' \u2013 Pearl Jam|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vitalogy-mw0000121446|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}</ref> He added that \"in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music\u2014the mantrafunk of 'Aye Davanita', the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of 'Bugs', and the chilling sonic collage 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me'.\" \"Bugs\" features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop,<ref name=\"Marks\">Marks, Craig. \"Let's Get Lost\".

Vedder said, \"I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express.\"<ref name=\"Marks\"/> The lyrics of \"Not for You\" express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and \"how youth is being sold and exploited\",<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> while Vedder said \"Corduroy\" is about \"one person's relationship with a million people.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> In \"Pry, To\" the phrase \"P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me\" is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of \"Immortality\" may be about [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of \"Immortality\" were altered before the song was released as part of the album.

The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of ''Vitalogy'' and ''Vs.'' with their bonus tracks and a copy of Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pearljam.com/news/vs-and-vitalogy-20th-anniversary-editions|title=''Vs.'' and ''Vitalogy'' 20th Anniversary Editions|publisher=pearljam.com|accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nThe original title for the album was ''Life''. The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The band continued its boycott against [[Ticketmaster]] during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. {{ISBN|0-306-81271-1}}, pg. 64</ref> The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.\n\nThe tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1997.</ref> Ament later said, \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour.

Formed in 1861 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], it was disbanded on April 25, 1862. Some of the unit's members joined the Union Army's [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|1st Louisiana Native Guard]], which later became the 73rd Regiment Infantry of the United States Colored Troops.\n\n==Confederate Louisiana militia==\nShortly after Louisiana's [[secession]], Governor [[Thomas Overton Moore]] issued pleas for troops on April 17 and April 21, 1861.  In response to the governor's request, a committee of ten prominent New Orleans [[free black]]s called a meeting at the Catholic Institute on April 22.  About two thousand people attended the meeting where muster lists were opened, with about 1,500 free blacks signing up.  Governor Moore accepted the services of these men as part of the state's militia.\n\nThe new militia regiment was formed during May 1861, consisting mostly of [[Free people of color|free persons of color]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] [[French-speaking|Francophone]]s ([[gens de couleur]]).  While some members of the new regiment came from wealthy prominent free-black families, a majority of the men were clerks, artisans, and skilled laborers.<ref name=\"jones\">Terry L. Jones (2012-10-19) [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/the-free-men-of-color-go-to-war/ \"The Free Men of Color Go to War\" - NYTimes.com]. Opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-18.</ref>  At that time, an estimated 10,000  [[African American]] residents of [[Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] had gained their freedom.\n\nOn May 29, 1861, Governor Moore appointed three white officers as commanders of the regiment, and company commanders were appointed from among the [[free black]]s of the regiment.\nThe militia unit was the first of any in [[North America]] to have African-American officers, pre dating the [[United States Colored Troops]]. This regiment was called the Louisiana Native Guard. Though ten per cent of its members would later join the [[Union Army]]'s 1st Louisiana Native Guard, the two were separate military units.\n\n== Activities ==\n\nThe Native Guards were volunteers, and as such supplied their own arms and uniforms.  These were displayed in a grand review of troops in New Orleans on November 23, 1861, and again on January 8, 1862.<ref>Bergeron, Arhur W., Jr. ''Louisianans in the Civil War'', \"Louisiana's Free Men of Color in Gray\", University of Missouri Press, 2002, p. 105-106.</ref>  They offered their services to escort Union prisoners (captured at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]) through New Orleans. Confederate General David Twiggs declined the offer, but thanked them for the \"promptness with which they answered the call.\"<ref>Jno. G. Devereux to J. L. Lewis, September 29, 1861, in ''War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies'', Series 4, Volume 1, 625.</ref>  The Louisiana State Legislature passed a law in January 1862 that reorganized the [[militia]] into only \u201c...free white males capable of bearing arms\u2026 \u201d.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/officialcopyofmi01loui#page/n3/mode/2up Official copy of the militia law of Louisiana, adopted by the state legislature, Jan. 23, 1862<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Native Guards regiment was affected by this law.  It was forced to disband on February 15, 1862, when the new law took effect.  \"Their demise was only temporary, however, for Governor Moore reinstated the Native Guards on March 24 after the [[U.S. Navy]] under [[Admiral]] [[David G. Farragut]] entered the Mississippi River.\" <ref>James G. Hollandsworth, ''The Louisiana Native Guards'', 8.</ref>\nAs the regular [[Confederate army|Confederate forces]] under [[Major General]] [[Mansfield Lovell]] abandoned New Orleans, the militia units were left to fend for themselves.

Formed in 1861 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], it was disbanded on April 25, 1862. Some of the unit's members joined the Union Army's [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|1st Louisiana Native Guard]], which later became the 73rd Regiment Infantry of the United States Colored Troops.\n\n==Confederate Louisiana militia==\nShortly after Louisiana's [[secession]], Governor [[Thomas Overton Moore]] issued pleas for troops on April 17 and April 21, 1861.  In response to the governor's request, a committee of ten prominent New Orleans [[free black]]s called a meeting at the Catholic Institute on April 22.  About two thousand people attended the meeting where muster lists were opened, with about 1,500 free blacks signing up.  Governor Moore accepted the services of these men as part of the state's militia.\n\nThe new militia regiment was formed during May 1861, consisting mostly of [[Free people of color|free persons of color]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] [[French-speaking|Francophone]]s ([[gens de couleur]]).  While some members of the new regiment came from wealthy prominent free-black families, a majority of the men were clerks, artisans, and skilled laborers.<ref name=\"jones\">Terry L. Jones (2012-10-19) [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/the-free-men-of-color-go-to-war/ \"The Free Men of Color Go to War\" - NYTimes.com]. Opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-18.</ref>  At that time, an estimated 10,000  [[African American]] residents of [[Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] had gained their freedom.\n\nOn May 29, 1861, Governor Moore appointed three white officers as commanders of the regiment, and company commanders were appointed from among the [[free black]]s of the regiment.\nThe militia unit was the first of any in [[North America]] to have African-American officers, pre dating the [[United States Colored Troops]]. This regiment was called the Louisiana Native Guard. Though ten per cent of its members would later join the [[Union Army]]'s 1st Louisiana Native Guard, the two were separate military units.\n\n== Activities ==\n\nThe Native Guards were volunteers, and as such supplied their own arms and uniforms.  These were displayed in a grand review of troops in New Orleans on November 23, 1861, and again on January 8, 1862.<ref>Bergeron, Arhur W., Jr. ''Louisianans in the Civil War'', \"Louisiana's Free Men of Color in Gray\", University of Missouri Press, 2002, p. 105-106.</ref>  They offered their services to escort Union prisoners (captured at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]) through New Orleans.

It was forced to disband on February 15, 1862, when the new law took effect.  \"Their demise was only temporary, however, for Governor Moore reinstated the Native Guards on March 24 after the [[U.S. Navy]] under [[Admiral]] [[David G. Farragut]] entered the Mississippi River.\" <ref>James G.
