He introduced the six-part [[rib vault]] to the building, a key feature of Gothic architecture,  which support the roof and which spread the weight downwards and outwards to the Buttresses outside and the columns below. He also introduced the use of high arcades in the choir, and devised the structure which made the walls between the structural elements thinner, allowing more and larger windows which filled the church with light. <ref>Britannica on-line , ''William of Sens'' </ref>\n \nWilliam was working on the church when he accidentally slipped and fell from from the scaffolding, and was badly injured.   The monk, [[Gervase of Canterbury|Gervase]] recorded that the accident was \"The vengeance of God or the spite of the Devil.\"  He tried for a time to direct the reconstruction from his sickbed.  He completed the eastern portion of construction in  but finally decided to return to France, where he died in 1180.  The work was on Canterbury Cathedral was completed by another architect, known only as [[William the Englishman]], who followed his plans.  <ref>[[BBC Four]] (UK) ''How to Build a Cathedral'', 27 April 2008.</ref>. He completed the eastern portion of the church, and it was finished in 1184, not long after this death.  \n\nThe architect and architectural historian [[Eugene Viollet-Le-Duc]] was the first to describe the connection between the Gothic of [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Canterbury Cathedral]], and the role of William in both.<ref>Britannica on-line,  ''William of Sens'' </ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Erlande-Brandenburg|first=Alain|title=Encylopedia Univeralis Dictionnaire des Architects|date=1999|publisher=Encyclopedia Universalis|language=fr|isbn=2-226-10952-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bechmann|first=Roland|title=Les Racines des Cath\u00e9drales|date=2017|publisher=Payot|language=fr|isbn=978-2-228-90651-7|ref=harv}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{portal bar|Architecture}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sens, Willian of}}\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:1180 deaths]]\n[[Category:Medieval French architects]]\n[[Category:Gothic architects]]\n[[Category:Stonemasons]]\n[[Category:People from Sens]]\n[[Category:12th-century architects]]\n\n===Bibliography==\n", "name_user": "SiefkinDR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSens Cathedral and Canterbury Cathedral:adding image", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Sens"}

They had a son, [[Arthur Plunkett, 9th Earl of Fingall]],  and a daughter, Harriet (died 1871), who married James Jones of [[Llanarth, Monmouthshire]], and was the mother of Sir [[Arthur James Herbert]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Obituary: General Sir Arthur James Herbert, K.C.B.  |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |date=25 November 1897 |page=6 }}</ref>\n\nFingall was appointed a Knight of the [[Order of St Patrick]] on 20 October 1821, on the occasion of the Royal Visit to Ireland of King [[George IV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/orders/patrick.htm|title=Knights of the Order of St Patrick|last=Rayment|first=Leigh|accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref> His creation as [[Baron Fingall]] in 1831 made him a member of the United Kingdom [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Cause of Catholic Emancipation==\n\nFor many years he was a champion of the cause of [[Catholic Emancipation]], and for a time worked closely with [[Daniel O'Connell]] to secure it. In 1807 he obtained an interview with the [[1st Duke of Wellington]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], who explained that Catholic Emancipation was not at that time practical politics, but that the remaining [[Penal Laws]] would be enforced with all possible moderation.<ref>[[Longford, Elizabeth]]  ''Wellington-the Years of the Sword''  Panther Books 1971</ref> As one of the leaders of the [[Catholic Association]] in its original form, which the Government maintained was illegal, he was briefly arrested, but never prosecuted.

It was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Johanna Harwood]], based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|similarly named 1957 novel]]. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet [[consulate]] clerk [[Tatiana Romanova]] in [[Turkey]], where [[SPECTRE]] plans to avenge Bond's killing of [[Julius No|Dr. No]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and in [[Scotland]]. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date.\n\n''From Russia with Love'' was a critical and commercial success. It took in more than $78 million in worldwide box-office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor ''Dr. No'', thereby becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in 1960s cinema.\n\nThis film also marked the debut of [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], a role he would play for 36 years (and seventeen films) until ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' in 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\nSeeking revenge against [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] Agent 007 [[James Bond]] for the death of their agent [[Julius No|Dr. No]] in [[Jamaica]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.}} international criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] begins training agents to kill him. Irish assassin Donald \"Red\" Grant proves himself by quickly killing a fake Bond with a [[garrote]] concealed in his wristwatch during training.\n\nSPECTRE's chief planner, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czech]] chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor [[cryptography]] device from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and lure Bond to his assassination. SPECTRE's chief executive [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|(Number 1)]] puts [[Rosa Klebb]] (Number 3), a former [[SMERSH]] (Soviet counter-intelligence) colonel, in charge of the mission. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor, then eliminate 007 and steal the machine for SPECTRE (to be eventually sold back to its legitimate owner). Klebb also recruits [[Tatiana Romanova]], a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in [[Istanbul]], who believes Klebb is still working for SMERSH.\n\nIn [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] informs Bond that Romanova has contacted \"Station T\" in Turkey, offering to defect with a top-secret Lektor on the condition that Bond handle her case personally. M decides the chance of obtaining a Lektor is worth the risk, and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] gives Bond an [[Briefcase|attach\u00e9 case]] with concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a [[tear gas]] booby trap, and an [[ArmaLite AR-7]] sniper rifle.\n\nIn Istanbul, Bond meets station head [[List of James Bond allies#Film allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], tailed by [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] agents working for Russia, who are, in turn, tailed by Grant; he kills one agent and dumps their car outside the Soviet Consulate. The Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a [[limpet mine]], but he is away from his desk with his mistress. He and Bond spy on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope in the aqueducts beneath Istanbul, and learn that Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim and Bond lay low at a rural [[Romani people|gypsy]] settlement, where Krilencu attacks them with a band of Bulgarians; Bond is saved by a sniper shot from Grant. Bond and Kerim track down Krilencu, and Kerim kills him with Bond's rifle.\n\nBond finds Romanova in his hotel suite and they have sex, neither aware SPECTRE is filming them. Romanova brings the consulate floor plans to the Ayasofya M\u00fczesi, formally the [[Hagia Sophia]], and Grant kills the other Bulgarian to ensure Bond receives them. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim steal the Lektor and escape with Romanova aboard the ''[[Orient Express]]''. Kerim and Bond subdue a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them. Grant kills Kerim and Benz, preventing Bond from rendezvousing with one of Kerim's men.\n\nAt the [[Belgrade]] station, Bond passes word of Kerim Bey's death to his son, and asks for an agent from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Station Y]] to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. Grant kills Nash, sent from Station Y, and poses as the agent. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond, taunting him that Romanova believed she was working for Mother Russia, and reveals his plan to leave the compromising film of Bond and Romanova with a blackmail letter, staging their deaths as a murder-suicide to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond tricks Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attach\u00e9 case and stabs him with the concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrote, and flees with Romanova in Grant's getaway truck.\n\nNumber 1 confronts Klebb and Kronsteen for their failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny\u2019s poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe, while Klebb is given one last chance to acquire the Lektor, which they have arranged to sell back to the Russians.\n\nFollowing Grant's escape route, Bond destroys a SPECTRE helicopter, and he and Romanova steal Grant's boat on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Pursued by Morzeny's squadron of SPECTRE powerboats, Bond detonates his own powerboat's fuel drums with a [[flare gun]], engulfing the pursuers in a sea of flames.\n\nHe and Romanova reach a hotel in [[Venice]], where they are attacked by Klebb, disguised as a maid. She tries to kick Bond with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her. Their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova depart on a romantic boat ride, and Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]] as [[List of James Bond allies#Film-specific allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], head of MI6 Station T in Istanbul.\n* [[Lotte Lenya]] as [[Rosa Klebb|Rosa Klebb (SPECTRE No. 3)]], a former [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] colonel-turned-SPECTRE operative.\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Donald \"Red\" Grant, a cunning SPECTRE assassin and one of the principal Bond enemies.\n* [[Daniela Bianchi]] as [[Tatiana Romanova]], a Soviet Consulate clerk and Bond's love interest.

It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented. One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation [[SPECTRE]] to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] over the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' between United Artists/MGM and writer [[Kevin McClory]]. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. Featuring a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[deathmatch]] mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the [[Aston Martin DB5]] from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and the rocket belt from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/james-bond-007-from-russia-with-love/654415p1.html|title=Interview with David Carson|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=29 September 2005|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/fromrussiawithlove/review.html|title=From Russia With Love Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 November 2005|access-date=8 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041325/http://www.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/reviews/from-russia-with-love-review-6137026/|archivedate=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe game was penned by [[Bruce Feirstein]], who had previously worked on the film scripts for ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', and the 2004 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]''.

It was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Johanna Harwood]], based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|similarly named 1957 novel]]. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet [[consulate]] clerk [[Tatiana Romanova]] in [[Turkey]], where [[SPECTRE]] plans to avenge Bond's killing of [[Julius No|Dr. No]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and in [[Scotland]]. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date.\n\n''From Russia with Love'' was a critical and commercial success. It took in more than $78 million in worldwide box-office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor ''Dr. No'', thereby becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in 1960s cinema.\n\nThis film also marked the debut of [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], a role he would play for 36 years (and seventeen films) until ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' in 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\nSeeking revenge against [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] Agent 007 [[James Bond]] for the death of their agent [[Julius No|Dr. No]] in [[Jamaica]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.}} international criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] begins training agents to kill him. Irish assassin Donald \"Red\" Grant proves himself by quickly killing a fake Bond with a [[garrote]] concealed in his wristwatch during training.\n\nSPECTRE's chief planner, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czech]] chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor [[cryptography]] device from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and lure Bond to his assassination. SPECTRE's chief executive [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|(Number 1)]] puts [[Rosa Klebb]] (Number 3), a former [[SMERSH]] (Soviet counter-intelligence) colonel, in charge of the mission. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor, then eliminate 007 and steal the machine for SPECTRE (to be eventually sold back to its legitimate owner). Klebb also recruits [[Tatiana Romanova]], a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in [[Istanbul]], who believes Klebb is still working for SMERSH.\n\nIn [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] informs Bond that Romanova has contacted \"Station T\" in Turkey, offering to defect with a top-secret Lektor on the condition that Bond handle her case personally. M decides the chance of obtaining a Lektor is worth the risk, and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] gives Bond an [[Briefcase|attach\u00e9 case]] with concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a [[tear gas]] booby trap, and an [[ArmaLite AR-7]] sniper rifle.\n\nIn Istanbul, Bond meets station head [[List of James Bond allies#Film allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], tailed by [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] agents working for Russia, who are, in turn, tailed by Grant; he kills one agent and dumps their car outside the Soviet Consulate. The Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a [[limpet mine]], but he is away from his desk with his mistress. He and Bond spy on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope in the aqueducts beneath Istanbul, and learn that Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim and Bond lay low at a rural [[Romani people|gypsy]] settlement, where Krilencu attacks them with a band of Bulgarians; Bond is saved by a sniper shot from Grant. Bond and Kerim track down Krilencu, and Kerim kills him with Bond's rifle.\n\nBond finds Romanova in his hotel suite and they have sex, neither aware SPECTRE is filming them. Romanova brings the consulate floor plans to the Ayasofya M\u00fczesi, formally the [[Hagia Sophia]], and Grant kills the other Bulgarian to ensure Bond receives them. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim steal the Lektor and escape with Romanova aboard the ''[[Orient Express]]''. Kerim and Bond subdue a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them. Grant kills Kerim and Benz, preventing Bond from rendezvousing with one of Kerim's men.\n\nAt the [[Belgrade]] station, Bond passes word of Kerim Bey's death to his son, and asks for an agent from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Station Y]] to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. Grant kills Nash, sent from Station Y, and poses as the agent. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond, taunting him that Romanova believed she was working for Mother Russia, and reveals his plan to leave the compromising film of Bond and Romanova with a blackmail letter, staging their deaths as a murder-suicide to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond tricks Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attach\u00e9 case and stabs him with the concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrote, and flees with Romanova in Grant's getaway truck.\n\nNumber 1 confronts Klebb and Kronsteen for their failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny\u2019s poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe, while Klebb is given one last chance to acquire the Lektor, which they have arranged to sell back to the Russians.\n\nFollowing Grant's escape route, Bond destroys a SPECTRE helicopter, and he and Romanova steal Grant's boat on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Pursued by Morzeny's squadron of SPECTRE powerboats, Bond detonates his own powerboat's fuel drums with a [[flare gun]], engulfing the pursuers in a sea of flames.\n\nHe and Romanova reach a hotel in [[Venice]], where they are attacked by Klebb, disguised as a maid. She tries to kick Bond with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her. Their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova depart on a romantic boat ride, and Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]] as [[List of James Bond allies#Film-specific allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], head of MI6 Station T in Istanbul.\n* [[Lotte Lenya]] as [[Rosa Klebb|Rosa Klebb (SPECTRE No. 3)]], a former [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] colonel-turned-SPECTRE operative.\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Donald \"Red\" Grant, a cunning SPECTRE assassin and one of the principal Bond enemies.\n* [[Daniela Bianchi]] as [[Tatiana Romanova]], a Soviet Consulate clerk and Bond's love interest.

It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented. One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation [[SPECTRE]] to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] over the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' between United Artists/MGM and writer [[Kevin McClory]]. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. Featuring a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[deathmatch]] mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the [[Aston Martin DB5]] from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and the rocket belt from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/james-bond-007-from-russia-with-love/654415p1.html|title=Interview with David Carson|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=29 September 2005|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/fromrussiawithlove/review.html|title=From Russia With Love Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 November 2005|access-date=8 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041325/http://www.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/reviews/from-russia-with-love-review-6137026/|archivedate=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe game was penned by [[Bruce Feirstein]], who had previously worked on the film scripts for ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', and the 2004 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]''.
