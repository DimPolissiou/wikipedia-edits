Prior to Spindletop, oil was primarily used for lighting and as a lubricant. Because of the quantity of oil discovered, burning [[petroleum]] as a [[fuel]] for mass consumption suddenly became economically feasible.z\n\nThe frenzy of oil exploration and the economic development it generated in the state became known as the [[Texas oil boom]]. The United States soon became the world's leading oil producer.\n\n__TOC__<!--force Table of Contents -->\n\n==History==\nThere had long been suspicions that oil might be under \"Spindletop Hill.\" The area was known for its vast [[sulfur]] [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and bubbling gas seepages that would ignite if lit. In August 1892, George W. O'Brien, George W. Carroll, [[Pattillo Higgins]], and others formed the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company to do exploratory drilling on Spindletop Hill. The company drilled many dry holes and ran into trouble, as investors began to balk at pouring more money into drilling with no oil to show for it.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nPattillo Higgins left the company and teamed with Captain [[Anthony Francis Lucas|Anthony F. Lucas]], the leading expert in the U.S. on salt-dome formations. Lucas made a lease agreement in 1899 with the Gladys City Company and a subsequent agreement with Higgins. Lucas drilled to {{Convert|575|ft|m|-1}} before running out of money. He secured additional funding from John H. Galey and James M. Guffey of [[Pittsburgh]], but the deal left Lucas with only an eighth share of the lease and Higgins with nothing.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.75.</ref>\n\nLucas continued drilling, and on January 10, 1901, at a depth of 1,139&nbsp;ft (347 m), what is known as the Lucas Gusher or the Lucas Geyser blew oil over {{convert|150|ft|m|-1}} in the air at a rate of {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}(4,200,000 gallons).  Nine days passed before the well was brought under control.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/>\n\nSpindletop was the largest [[Oil gusher|gusher]] the world had seen and catapulted Beaumont into an oil-fueled [[boomtown (geography)|boomtown]].  Beaumont's population of 10,000 tripled in 3 months and eventually rose to 50,000.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.69.</ref>  Speculation led land prices to increase rapidly. By the end of 1902, more than 500&nbsp;companies had been formed and 285&nbsp;wells were in operation.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/>\n\nSpindletop was the first oilfield found on the US Gulf Coast, and prompted further drilling, and further oil-field discoveries. Oil drillers looking for another Spindletop particularly sought out other salt domes, and were often successful. The Gulf Coast turned into a major oil region.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Standard Oil]], which then had a monopoly or near-monopoly on the petroleum industry in the eastern states, was prevented from moving aggressively into the new oilfield by state antitrust laws. Populist sentiment against Standard Oil was particularly strong at the time of the Spindletop discovery. In 1900, an oil-products marketing company affiliated with Standard Oil had been banned from the state for its cutthroat business practices. Although Standard built refineries in the area, it was unable to dominate the new Gulf Coast oil fields the way it had in the eastern states.  As a result, a number of startup oil companies at Spindletop, such as Texaco and Gulf Oil, grew into formidable competitors to Standard Oil.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Titan: the Life of John D. Rockefeller'' {New York: Random House, 1998} 431.</ref>\n\nAmong those drilling at Spindletop was [[W. Scott Heywood]], a native of [[Cleveland]], Ohio, who in 1901 made the first oil discovery in nearby [[Jeff Davis Parish, Louisiana|Jeff Davis Parish]] in southwestern [[Louisiana]]. In 1932, Heywood was elected to a single term in the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site25.php|title=Heywood, Walter Scott|publisher=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography|accessdate=January 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225173835/http://lahistory.org/site25.php|archivedate=February 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nProduction at Spindletop began to decline rapidly after 1902, and the wells produced only {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} by 1904.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/> Unfortunately the developers had signed a 20-year contract to sell 25,000 barrels per day at $0.25 per barrel to [[Shell Oil]]. When the price climbed above $0.35 per barrel, the operation was stressed and Mellon who had lent money for Spindle Top\u2019s development took control of the company, won a lawsuit allowing Mellon to renege on the contract, and created [[Gulf Oil]]. On November 14, 1925,  the [[Yount-Lee Oil Company]] brought in its McFaddin No. 2 at a depth around {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}}, sparking a second boom, which culminated in the field's peak production year of 1927, during which 21&nbsp;million barrels (3.3 GL) were produced.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/>  Over the 10 years following the McFaddin discovery, more than 72&nbsp;million barrels (11.4 GL) of oil were produced, mostly from the newer areas of the field.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Spindletop continued as a productive source of oil until about 1936.

Prior to Spindletop, oil was primarily used for lighting and as a lubricant. Because of the quantity of oil discovered, burning [[petroleum]] as a [[fuel]] for mass consumption suddenly became economically feasible.\n\nThe frenzy of oil exploration and the economic development it generated in the state became known as the [[Texas oil boom]]. The United States soon became the world's leading oil producer.\n\n__TOC__<!--force Table of Contents -->\n\n==History==\nThere had long been suspicions that oil might be under \"Spindletop Hill.\" The area was known for its vast [[sulfur]] [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and bubbling gas seepages that would ignite if lit. In August 1892, George W. O'Brien, George W. Carroll, [[Pattillo Higgins]], and others formed the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company to do exploratory drilling on Spindletop Hill. The company drilled many dry holes and ran into trouble, as investors began to balk at pouring more money into drilling with no oil to show for it.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nPattillo Higgins left the company and teamed with Captain [[Anthony Francis Lucas|Anthony F. Lucas]], the leading expert in the U.S. on salt-dome formations. Lucas made a lease agreement in 1899 with the Gladys City Company and a subsequent agreement with Higgins. Lucas drilled to {{Convert|575|ft|m|-1}} before running out of money. He secured additional funding from John H. Galey and James M. Guffey of [[Pittsburgh]], but the deal left Lucas with only an eighth share of the lease and Higgins with nothing.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.75.</ref>\n\nLucas continued drilling, and on January 10, 1901, at a depth of 1,139&nbsp;ft (347 m), what is known as the Lucas Gusher or the Lucas Geyser blew oil over {{convert|150|ft|m|-1}} in the air at a rate of {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}(4,200,000 gallons).  Nine days passed before the well was brought under control.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/>\n\nSpindletop was the largest [[Oil gusher|gusher]] the world had seen and catapulted Beaumont into an oil-fueled [[boomtown (geography)|boomtown]].  Beaumont's population of 10,000 tripled in 3 months and eventually rose to 50,000.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.69.</ref>  Speculation led land prices to increase rapidly. By the end of 1902, more than 500&nbsp;companies had been formed and 285&nbsp;wells were in operation.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/>\n\nSpindletop was the first oilfield found on the US Gulf Coast, and prompted further drilling, and further oil-field discoveries. Oil drillers looking for another Spindletop particularly sought out other salt domes, and were often successful. The Gulf Coast turned into a major oil region.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Standard Oil]], which then had a monopoly or near-monopoly on the petroleum industry in the eastern states, was prevented from moving aggressively into the new oilfield by state antitrust laws. Populist sentiment against Standard Oil was particularly strong at the time of the Spindletop discovery. In 1900, an oil-products marketing company affiliated with Standard Oil had been banned from the state for its cutthroat business practices. Although Standard built refineries in the area, it was unable to dominate the new Gulf Coast oil fields the way it had in the eastern states.  As a result, a number of startup oil companies at Spindletop, such as Texaco and Gulf Oil, grew into formidable competitors to Standard Oil.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Titan: the Life of John D. Rockefeller'' {New York: Random House, 1998} 431.</ref>\n\nAmong those drilling at Spindletop was [[W. Scott Heywood]], a native of [[Cleveland]], Ohio, who in 1901 made the first oil discovery in nearby [[Jeff Davis Parish, Louisiana|Jeff Davis Parish]] in southwestern [[Louisiana]]. In 1932, Heywood was elected to a single term in the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site25.php|title=Heywood, Walter Scott|publisher=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography|accessdate=January 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225173835/http://lahistory.org/site25.php|archivedate=February 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nProduction at Spindletop began to decline rapidly after 1902, and the wells produced only {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} by 1904.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/> Unfortunately the developers had signed a 20-year contract to sell 25,000 barrels per day at $0.25 per barrel to [[Shell Oil]]. When the price climbed above $0.35 per barrel, the operation was stressed and Mellon who had lent money for Spindle Top\u2019s development took control of the company, won a lawsuit allowing Mellon to renege on the contract, and created [[Gulf Oil]]. On November 14, 1925,  the [[Yount-Lee Oil Company]] brought in its McFaddin No. 2 at a depth around {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}}, sparking a second boom, which culminated in the field's peak production year of 1927, during which 21&nbsp;million barrels (3.3 GL) were produced.<ref name=\"HOT: Spindletop\"/>  Over the 10 years following the McFaddin discovery, more than 72&nbsp;million barrels (11.4 GL) of oil were produced, mostly from the newer areas of the field.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Spindletop continued as a productive source of oil until about 1936.

But there are still rules in war which a civilized people tries to follow... [Bauer focused on events in Abu Zureiq a day or two earlier.] When the village was conquered, the villagers tried to escape and save themselves by fleeing to the fields of the [Jezreel] Valley. Forces from nearby settlements sortied out and outflanked them. There were exchanges of fire in which several of these Arabs were killed. Others surrendered or were captured unarmed.  Most were killed [i.e., murdered]. And these were not gang members as was later written in [the Mapam daily] ''[[Al Hamishmar]]'' but defenceless, beaten peasants. Only members of my kibbutz [[Hazorea]] took prisoners... Also in the village, when adult males were discovered hiding hours after the end of battle -they were killed... It is said that there were cases of rape, but it is possible that this is one of those made-up tales of \"heroism\" that soldiers are prone to. Of the property in the houses and farm animals left without minders, they took what they could: One took a kettle for coffee, another a horse, a third a cow...One may understand and justify, if they took cows from the village for Mishmar Ha'emek for example, or if soldiers who conquered the village would slaughter and fry chickens for themselves.

Directed by [[Lewis Milestone]], it stars [[Louis Wolheim]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Arnold Lucy]] and [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]].\n\n''All Quiet on the Western Front'' opened to wide acclaim in the United States. Considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in [[World War I]], it made the [[American Film Institute]]'s first ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]]'' list in 1998. A decade later, after the same organization polled over 1,500 workers in the creative community, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was ranked the seventh-best American [[epic film]].<ref>{{cite news | author = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = June 17, 2008 | url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | accessdate= June 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619034738/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072| archivedate= June 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Top 10 Epic | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/epic.html | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |accessdate= June 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619174209/http://www.afi.com/10top10/epic.html| archivedate= June 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 1990, the film was selected and preserved by the United States [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" The film was the first to win the [[Academy Awards]] for both [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\nIts sequel, ''[[The Road Back (film)|The Road Back]]'' (1937), portrays members of the 2nd Company returning home after the war.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]] and \"saving the Fatherland\". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company.  Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, \"You're going to be soldiers\u2014and that's ''all''.\"\n\nThe new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. \n\nThe young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, \"Kat\" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers \"pay\" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.\n\nThe new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.\n\nThey hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the [[Origins of World War I|causes of the war]] and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]]; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, the leaders of Europe should be stripped to their underwear and \"fight it out with clubs\".\n\nOne day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives at the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation. He is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. Throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.\n\nGoing back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a [[Catholic]] hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.\n\nPaul is given a furlough and visits his family at home.  He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final \"push for Paris\" is soon to occur.  When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students.  Professor Kantorek asks Paul to detail his experience, at which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners. \n\nThis revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a \"coward\". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd Company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden.  He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war.  Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital, only to find that Kat has been killed by a second explosion.  Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.\n\nIn the final scene, Paul is back on the front line. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Smiling, he reaches out for the butterfly. While reaching, however, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper.  The final sequence shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lew Ayres]] as Paul B\u00e4umer\n* [[Louis Wolheim]] as Stanislaus Katczinsky\n* [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]] as Himmelstoss\n* [[Arnold Lucy]] as Professor Kantorek\n* [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]] as Franz Kemmerich\n* [[Scott Kolk]] as Leer\n* [[Owen Davis, Jr.]] as Peter\n* [[William Bakewell]] as Albert Kropp\n* [[Russell Gleason]] as M\u00fcller\n* [[Richard Alexander (actor)|Richard Alexander]] as Westhus\n* [[Harold Goodwin (American actor)|Harold Goodwin]] as Detering\n* [[Slim Summerville]] as Tjaden\n* Walter Browne Rogers as Behn\n* [[G.

This scene is different from the book, and was inspired by an earlier scene showing a butterfly collection in Paul's home. The scene was shot during the editing phase, so the actors were no longer available and Milestone had to use his own hand as Paul's.\n\nNoted comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]] was originally cast as Paul's mother and completed the film but preview audiences, used to seeing her in comic roles, laughed when she appeared onscreen so Milestone re-shot her scenes with [[Beryl Mercer]] before the film was released. The preview audience remains the only one who saw Pitts in the role, although she does appear for about 30 seconds in the film's original preview trailer.\n\nThe film was shot with two cameras side by side, with one negative edited as a sound film and the other edited as an \"[[International Sound Version]]\" for distribution in non-English speaking areas.\n\nA great number of German Army veterans were living in [[Los Angeles]] at the time of filming and were recruited as bit players and technical advisers.

Due to its anti-war and perceived anti-[[Germany|German]] messages, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] as well as other right-wing circles in Germany opposed the film. During and after its German premiere in Berlin on 4 December 1930, Nazi brownshirts under the command of [[Joseph Goebbels]] disrupted the viewings by setting off stink bombs, throwing sneezing powder in the air and releasing white mice in the theaters, eventually escalating to attacking audience members perceived to be Jewish and forcing projectors to shut down. They repeatedly yelled out \"''Judenfilm!''\" (\"Jewish film!\") while doing this. Goebbels wrote about one such disruption in his personal diary.<ref>David Mikies [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/134503/hollywood-nazi-urwand \"Hollywood\u2019s Creepy Love Affair With Adolf Hitler, in Explosive New Detail\"], ''Tablet'', June 10, 2013</ref><ref name=SI>{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=July 1, 2019|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref> The Nazi campaign was successful and German authorities outlawed the film on 11 December 1930.

Directed by [[Lewis Milestone]], it stars [[Louis Wolheim]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Arnold Lucy]] and [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]].\n\n''All Quiet on the Western Front'' opened to wide acclaim in the United States. Considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in [[World War I]], it made the [[American Film Institute]]'s first ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]]'' list in 1998. A decade later, after the same organization polled over 1,500 workers in the creative community, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was ranked the seventh-best American [[epic film]].<ref>{{cite news | author = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = June 17, 2008 | url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | accessdate= June 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619034738/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072| archivedate= June 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Top 10 Epic | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/epic.html | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |accessdate= June 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619174209/http://www.afi.com/10top10/epic.html| archivedate= June 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 1990, the film was selected and preserved by the United States [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" The film was the first to win the [[Academy Awards]] for both [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\nIts sequel, ''[[The Road Back (film)|The Road Back]]'' (1937), portrays members of the 2nd Company returning home after the war.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]] and \"saving the Fatherland\". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company.  Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, \"You're going to be soldiers\u2014and that's ''all''.\"\n\nThe new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. \n\nThe young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, \"Kat\" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers \"pay\" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.\n\nThe new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.\n\nThey hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the [[Origins of World War I|causes of the war]] and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]]; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, the leaders of Europe should be stripped to their underwear and \"fight it out with clubs\".\n\nOne day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives at the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation. He is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. Throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.\n\nGoing back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a [[Catholic]] hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.\n\nPaul is given a furlough and visits his family at home.  He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final \"push for Paris\" is soon to occur.  When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students.  Professor Kantorek asks Paul to detail his experience, at which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners. \n\nThis revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a \"coward\". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd Company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden.  He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war.  Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital, only to find that Kat has been killed by a second explosion.  Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.\n\nIn the final scene, Paul is back on the front line. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Smiling, he reaches out for the butterfly.

This scene is different from the book, and was inspired by an earlier scene showing a butterfly collection in Paul's home. The scene was shot during the editing phase, so the actors were no longer available and Milestone had to use his own hand as Paul's.\n\nNoted comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]] was originally cast as Paul's mother and completed the film but preview audiences, used to seeing her in comic roles, laughed when she appeared onscreen so Milestone re-shot her scenes with [[Beryl Mercer]] before the film was released. The preview audience remains the only one who saw Pitts in the role, although she does appear for about 30 seconds in the film's original preview trailer.\n\nThe film was shot with two cameras side by side, with one negative edited as a sound film and the other edited as an \"[[International Sound Version]]\" for distribution in non-English speaking areas.\n\nA great number of German Army veterans were living in [[Los Angeles]] at the time of filming and were recruited as bit players and technical advisers. Around 2,000 extras were utilized during production.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=67079&category=Notes Notes]</ref> Among them was future director [[Fred Zinnemann]] (''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'', ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]''), who was fired for impudence.\n\n==Releases==\nThe original [[international Sound Version]] of the film, lasting 152 minutes,<ref name=AFI/> was first shown in Los Angeles on April 21, 1930, and premiered in New York on April 25, 1930.<ref name= IMDbRelease>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020629/releaseinfo IMDb: ''All Quiet on the Western Front - Release Info''] Linked March 24, 2014</ref> This version has intertitles and a synchronized music and effects track.

Due to its anti-war and perceived anti-[[Germany|German]] messages, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] as well as other right-wing circles in Germany opposed the film. During and after its German premiere in Berlin on 4 December 1930, Nazi brownshirts under the command of [[Joseph Goebbels]] disrupted the viewings by setting off stink bombs, throwing sneezing powder in the air and releasing white mice in the theaters, eventually escalating to attacking audience members perceived to be Jewish and forcing projectors to shut down. They repeatedly yelled out \"''Judenfilm!''\" (\"Jewish film!\") while doing this. Goebbels wrote about one such disruption in his personal diary.<ref>David Mikies [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/134503/hollywood-nazi-urwand \"Hollywood\u2019s Creepy Love Affair With Adolf Hitler, in Explosive New Detail\"], ''Tablet'', June 10, 2013</ref><ref name=SI>{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=July 1, 2019|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref> The Nazi campaign was successful and German authorities outlawed the film on 11 December 1930.
