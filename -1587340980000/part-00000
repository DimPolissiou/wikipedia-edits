It is a large bay with three roughly straight sides meeting at right angles, each about {{convert|15|mi|round=5}} in length. The eastern coast of the Wash is entirely within Norfolk, and extends from a point a little north of [[Hunstanton]] in the north to the mouth of the [[River Great Ouse]] at [[King's Lynn]] in the south. The opposing coast, which is roughly parallel to the east coast, runs from [[Gibraltar Point]] to the mouth of the River Welland, all within Lincolnshire. The southern coast runs roughly north-west to south-east, connecting these two river mouths and is punctuated by the mouth of a third river, the River Nene.\n\nInland from the Wash the land is flat, low-lying and often marshy: these are [[the Fens]] of Lincolnshire, [[Cambridgeshire]] and Norfolk. To the east is the North Sea.\n\nOwing to deposits of sediment and [[land reclamation]], the coastline of the Wash has altered markedly within historical times. Several towns once on the coast of the Wash (notably King's Lynn) are now some distance inland. Much of the Wash itself is very shallow, with several large sandbanks, such as Breast Sand, Bulldog Sand, Roger Sand and Old South Sand, which are exposed at low tide, especially along the south coast. For this reason, navigation in the Wash can be hazardous.<ref>See assembled [https://nbsg.wordpress.com/washing/ navigational guidance].</ref>\n\nTwo commercial shipping lane channels lead inland from The Wash, the [[River Nene]] leading to [[Sutton_Bridge#Dock|Port Sutton Bridge]] in Lincolnshire and further inland to the [[Port of Wisbech]] in Cambridgeshire, and the River Great Ouse leading to [[King's Lynn Docks]] in Norfolk. Both shipping lanes have their own [[maritime pilot]] stations to guide and navigate incoming and outgoing cargo ships in The Wash.\n\nA re-survey of the coastline of The Wash carried out by The Ordnance Survey in 2011 revealed that an estimated additional {{convert|3000|acres|km2}} on its coastline had been created by accretion since previous surveys between 1960 and 1980.\n\n==Water temperature==\n[[File:Ruth Do328 Wash 16.08.12R edited-2.jpg|thumb|The Wash looking WSW from over Hunstanton. The Great Ouse and Welland are visible running south.]]\nThe Wash varies enormously in water temperature throughout the year. Winter temperatures are brought near freezing from the cold North Sea flows. Summer water temperatures can reach {{convert|20|-|23|C|F|abbr=on}} after prolonged high ambient air temperature and sun. This effect, which typically happens in the shallow areas around beaches and often only in pockets of water, is exaggerated by the large sheltered [[tidal reach]].\n\n==Wash River==\nAt the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|latest glaciation]], and while the sea level remained lower than it is today, the rivers Witham, Welland, [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|Glen]], Nene and Great Ouse joined into a large river.\n\nThe deep valley of the Wash was formed, not by an interglacial river, but by ice of the [[Wolstonian Stage|Wolstonian]] and [[Wisconsin glaciation|Devensian]] stages flowing southwards up the slope represented by the modern coast and forming [[tunnel valley]]s, of which the [[Silver Pit]] is one of many. This process gave the Silver Pit its depth and narrowness. When the tunnel valley was free of ice and seawater, it was occupied by the river. This kept it free of sediment, unlike most tunnel valleys. Since the sea flooded it, the valley seems to have been kept open by tidal action. During the [[Eemian Stage|Ipswichian Stage]], the Wash River probably flowed by way of the site of the Silver Pit, but the tunnel valley would not have been formed at this stage, as its alignment seems inconsistent.\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe Wash is made up of extensive [[salt marsh]]es, major inter-tidal banks of sand and mud, shallow waters and deep channels. As understanding of the importance of the natural marshes has increased in the 21st century, the seawall at [[Freiston]] has been breached in three places to increase the salt-marsh area, to provide extra [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for [[bird]]s, particularly [[wader]]s, and as a natural flood-prevention measure.

It is a large bay with three roughly straight sides meeting at right angles, each about {{convert|15|mi|round=5}} in length. The eastern coast of the Wash is entirely within Norfolk, and extends from a point a little north of [[Hunstanton]] in the north to the mouth of the [[River Great Ouse]] at [[King's Lynn]] in the south. The opposing coast, which is roughly parallel to the east coast, runs from [[Gibraltar Point]] to the mouth of the River Welland, all within Lincolnshire. The southern coast runs roughly north-west to south-east, connecting these two river mouths and is punctuated by the mouth of a third river, the River Nene.\n\nInland from the Wash the land is flat, low-lying and often marshy: these are [[the Fens]] of Lincolnshire, [[Cambridgeshire]] and Norfolk. To the east is the North Sea.\n\nOwing to deposits of sediment and [[land reclamation]], the coastline of the Wash has altered markedly within historical times. Several towns once on the coast of the Wash (notably King's Lynn) are now some distance inland. Much of the Wash itself is very shallow, with several large sandbanks, such as Breast Sand, Bulldog Sand, Roger Sand and Old South Sand, which are exposed at low tide, especially along the south coast. For this reason, navigation in the Wash can be hazardous.<ref>See assembled [https://nbsg.wordpress.com/washing/ navigational guidance].</ref>\n\nTwo commercial shipping lane channels lead inland from The Wash, the [[River Nene]] leading to [[Sutton_Bridge#Dock|Port Sutton Bridge]] in Lincolnshire and further inland to the [[Port of Wisbech]] in Cambridgeshire, and the River Great Ouse leading to [[King's Lynn Docks]] in Norfolk. Both shipping lanes have their own [[maritime pilot]] stations to guide and navigate incoming and outgoing cargo ships in The Wash.\n\nA re-survey of the coastline of The Wash carried out by The Ordnance Survey in 2011 revealed that an estimated additional {{convert|3000|acres|km2}} on its coastline had been created by accretion since previous surveys between 1960 and 1980.\n\n==Water temperature==\n[[File:Ruth Do328 Wash 16.08.12R edited-2.jpg|thumb|The Wash looking WSW from over Hunstanton. The Great Ouse and Welland are visible running south.]]\nThe Wash varies enormously in water temperature throughout the year. Winter temperatures are brought near freezing from the cold North Sea flows. Summer water temperatures can reach {{convert|20|-|23|C|F|abbr=on}} after prolonged high ambient air temperature and sun. This effect, which typically happens in the shallow areas around beaches and often only in pockets of water, is exaggerated by the large sheltered [[tidal reach]].\n\n==Wash River==\nAt the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|latest glaciation]], and while the sea level remained lower than it is today, the rivers Witham, Welland, [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|Glen]], Nene and Great Ouse joined into a large river.\n\nThe deep valley of the Wash was formed, not by an interglacial river, but by ice of the [[Wolstonian Stage|Wolstonian]] and [[Wisconsin glaciation|Devensian]] stages flowing southwards up the slope represented by the modern coast and forming [[tunnel valley]]s, of which the [[Silver Pit]] is one of many. This process gave the Silver Pit its depth and narrowness. When the tunnel valley was free of ice and seawater, it was occupied by the river. This kept it free of sediment, unlike most tunnel valleys. Since the sea flooded it, the valley seems to have been kept open by tidal action. During the [[Eemian Stage|Ipswichian Stage]], the Wash River probably flowed by way of the site of the Silver Pit, but the tunnel valley would not have been formed at this stage, as its alignment seems inconsistent.\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe Wash is made up of extensive [[salt marsh]]es, major inter-tidal banks of sand and mud, shallow waters and deep channels. As understanding of the importance of the natural marshes has increased in the 21st century, the seawall at [[Freiston]] has been breached in three places to increase the salt-marsh area, to provide extra [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for [[bird]]s, particularly [[wader]]s, and as a natural flood-prevention measure. The extensive creeks in the salt marsh and the vegetation that grows there help to dissipate wave energy, so enhancing the protection afforded to land behind the salt marsh. This is an example of the recent exploration of the possibilities of [[sustainable]] [[coastal management]] by adopting [[soft engineering]] techniques, rather than with dykes and drainage. The same scheme includes new [[Brackish water|brackish]] [[lagoon]] habitat.\n\n[[File:Snettisham-jetty.JPG|thumb|The jetty at [[Snettisham RSPB reserve]]]]\nOn the eastern side of the Wash, low chalk cliffs, with a noted stratum of red chalk, are found at Hunstanton. The [[gravel]] pits (lagoons) found at [[Snettisham RSPB reserve]] are an important roost for waders at high tide. This Special Protection Area (SPA) borders onto the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area. To the north-west, the Wash extends to Gibraltar Point, another SPA.\n\nThe partly confined nature of the Wash habitats, combined with ample tidal flows, allows [[shellfish]] to breed, especially [[shrimp]], [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s and [[mussel]]s.

Another air-weapons training range located on The Wash \u2013 [[RAF Wainfleet]], operating since 1938 \u2013 was decommissioned in 2010.\n\n==Local traditions==\nSailing from out of the South Lincolnshire Fens into the Wash (especially for shell-fishing) is traditionally known locally as \"going down below\". The origin of the phrase is unknown.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.southhollandlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/AOS-D-0045-When-Barges-worked-river.pdf |title=When barges worked up the River Welland |newspaper=Lincolnshire Free Press |date=9 February 1993 |accessdate=8 January 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\nSt Botolph's, the parish church of Boston (nicknamed the [[Boston Stump]]) is a Lincolnshire landmark. It can be seen on clear days from the Norfolk side of the Wash. The [[Outer Trial Bank]], a remnant of a 1970s experiment, lies some {{convert|2|mi|km}} off the Lincolnshire coast near the River Nene.\n\n==Proposed racetrack==\nIn 1934 a proposal was made, supported by racing driver [[Malcolm Campbell]], to build a {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} race track on reclaimed land from Boston to [[Gibraltar Point]], near [[Skegness]]. It would have been used as a road to Skegness when there was no racing. There was also to be a long lake for boat racing inside the track loop. The financial straits in the 1930s prevented the project from proceeding.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*J. Cook and N.
