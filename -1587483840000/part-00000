{"title_page": "Pope Pius IX and Judaism", "text_new": "The relations between [[Pope Pius IX]] and Judaism were off to a good start at the beginning of his papacy, but relations later soured after anti-clerical revolutions removed most of the pontiff's temporal power and he stiffened into intolerance. While Pius rejected charges of [[antisemitism]], the rift created by the [[Mortara Affair]] undermined his moral authority in the eyes of some during the rest of his pontificate.    \n\n==Status in the Papal States== \nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had considerably more rights than members of other religions. Protestants and Jews were not admitted to the Papal government, or to the social circles of Rome, nor did they have the same standing as members of the Catholic faith. The precise legal difference is difficult to pin down, as there existed no bill of rights or even a clear collection of laws in the Papal States at the time of Pius IX.<ref>Schmidlin 44 ff</ref> Even ecclesiastical laws ([[canon law]]) were not formalized until 1917, some forty years after the death of Pope Pius IX.\n\nEarly in his pontificate, in 1847, Pius IX baptized four Roman Jews and welcomed them personally with warm words into the Catholic Church.<ref>Pougeois I, p. 184.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Pio9carriage.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The Papal carriage of Pius IX]]\n\n==Legislative discrimination and intolerance==\nAt Pius IX's accession in 1846, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Judaism]] were the only [[religion]]s allowed by law ([[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[worship]] was allowed to visiting foreigners, but forbidden to Italians; [[atheism]] was unthinkable). Jews in Rome were required to live [[Roman ghetto|in a ghetto]], a separated quarter of the city, and had very limited rights. His relations with them changed over time, from good to worse. He initially repealed laws that forbade Jews to practice certain professions and rescinded laws which forced them to listen four times per year to [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]]s aimed at their conversion.\n\nAfter the pope's 1849 overthrow, the short-lived [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued wide ranging religious freedom measures. After French troops brought him back to power in 1850,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures that eliminated even some his early openings, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III,258</ref>\n\n==Mortara affair==\nIn 1858 in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was seized from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill six years earlier, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the Papal States law forbid Christians being raised by Jews, even their own parents, and considered the informal baptism performed by the teen-age servant a valid religious conversion. Pius IX thereafter steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> \n\nWhen a delegation of prominent Jews saw the Pope, he brought Mortara with him to show that the boy was happy in his care. In 1865 he said: \"I had the right and the duty to do what I did for this boy, and if I had to, I would do it again.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = James | last = Carroll | title = ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews &mdash; A History'' | pages = 379&ndash;380 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Books | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-618-21908-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Kenneth | last = Stowe | title = ''Popes, Church, and Jews in the Middle Ages: Confrontation and Response'' | pages = 57&ndash;58 | publisher = Ashgate Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7546-5915-1}}</ref>\n\nCalls from ''[[The Times]]'' and from numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.

While Pius rejected charges of [[antisemitism]], the rift created by the [[Mortara Affair]] undermined his moral authority throughout most of his long pontificate.    \n\n==Status in the Papal States== \nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had considerably more rights than members of other religions. Protestants and Jews were not admitted to the Papal government, or to the social circles of Rome, nor did they have the same standing as members of the Catholic faith. The precise legal difference is difficult to pin down, as there existed no bill of rights or even a clear collection of laws in the Papal States at the time of Pius IX.<ref>Schmidlin 44 ff</ref> Even ecclesiastical laws ([[canon law]]) were not formalized until 1917, some forty years after the death of Pope Pius IX.\n\nEarly in his pontificate, in 1847, Pius IX baptized four Roman Jews and welcomed them personally with warm words into the Catholic Church.<ref>Pougeois I, p. 184.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Pio9carriage.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The Papal carriage of Pius IX]]\n\n==Legislative discrimination and intolerance==\nAt Pius IX's accession in 1846, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Judaism]] were the only [[religion]]s allowed by law ([[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[worship]] was allowed to visiting foreigners, but forbidden to Italians; [[atheism]] was unthinkable). Jews in Rome were required to live [[Roman ghetto|in a ghetto]], a separated quarter of the city, and had very limited rights. His relations with them changed over time, from good to worse. He initially repealed laws that forbade Jews to practice certain professions and rescinded laws which forced them to listen four times per year to [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]]s aimed at their conversion.\n\nAfter the pope's 1849 overthrow, the short-lived [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued wide ranging religious freedom measures. After French troops brought him back to power in 1850,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures that eliminated even some his early openings, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III,258</ref>\n\n==Mortara affair==\nIn 1858 in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was seized from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill six years earlier, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the Papal States law forbid Christians being raised by Jews, even their own parents, and considered the informal baptism performed by the teen-age servant a valid religious conversion. Pius IX thereafter steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> \n\nWhen a delegation of prominent Jews saw the Pope, he brought Mortara with him to show that the boy was happy in his care.

The film changed [[Hindi cinema's]] trend from [[romance films]] to [[action films]], and pioneered [[Bachchan's]] new image of a brooding but explosive person who fights back when cornered, known as \"The Angry Young Man.\"\n\nThe film started a new wave in [[Bollywood]]. At a time when [[India]] was suffering from corruption and low economic growth, and the common man was left with frustration and anger over the system, ''Zanjeer'' began shifting Hindi cinema in a violent and aggressive direction. Reflecting the anger of the masses, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] was seen as the new hero, who had the courage to fight against the wrongs while maintaining moral values at the same time. This film also ended the struggling period for [[Bachchan]], and turned him into a rising star. The film was a [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|blockbuster success]], [[domestically in India]] and [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|overseas in]] the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIt was the first of many collaborations between screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Ever since ''Zanjeer'', [[Salim-Javed]] wrote many of their subsequent scripts with [[Bachchan]] in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), establishing [[Bachchan]] as a superstar.<ref name=\"hindustantimes\" /> In addition to being a turning point for [[Bachchan's]] career and Hindi cinema, ''Zanjeer'' was also a turning point for [[South Indian cinema]], with [[Bachchan's]] acting inspiring future [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Superstar Rajinikanth]].<ref name=\"indianexpress\" /> ''Zanjeer'' remains an important film in the history of [[Indian cinema]] and is regarded as a classic today.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on [[Diwali]] with the murder of young Vijay Khanna's parents, committed by a man of unknown identity with a white horse on his charm bracelet, \"zanjeer\". Because of this traumatic event, Vijay has recurring [[nightmare]]s of a white [[stallion]]. Even as a child Vijay stays socially awkward and stays away from the other kids, showing the audience that he believes himself to be alone. Fast forward 20 years, and Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is now an inspector, an honest police officer in a town where few are just. He receives complaints about a local man, Sher Khan (Pathan) ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), who is running gambling dens. When he calls Khan in for questioning, Khan's superiority complex chafes against Khanna's police authority, as he scolds the officer, telling him he only orders him around due to the uniform he wears. Vijay takes him up on his challenge, and meets him in street clothes to fight him. At fight's end, Sher Khan not only closes his gambling dens, but has gained respect for Vijay. He becomes an [[auto mechanic]], and reforms his ways.\n\nVarious dealings of the underworld continue unabated throughout the town, all tracing back to [[gang]] leader Teja ([[Ajit Khan]]). A mysterious caller continually phones Inspector Khanna to inform him exactly when a crime is about to take place, but hangs up before Khanna can extract any more information out of him. When a traffic accident perpetrated by gang members leaves several children dead, a witness, a street performer named Mala ([[Jaya Bhaduri]]), is bribed by Teja's men to keep quiet. When she is questioned by Vijay, he becomes enraged at her denying she knows anything, and, to sway her differently, takes her into the [[morgue]] to view the mangled bodies of the children. She has a change of heart, and comes clean, asking that the bribe be donated to an [[orphanage]]. She identifies the man behind the traffic accident.\n\nOnce it is known that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men come after her. She is chased through the night, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and coming to Inspector Khanna's house, desperate for shelter. He lets her in, allows her to stay, and the two discover that they are both [[orphans]], and discuss the fears associated with living alone. Khanna kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep house, as well as English, and other refinements.\n\nEventually, Vijay is framed for bribery, stripped of his title and position as inspector, and jailed for 6 months on false charges, trapped by Teja. When he is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala, by this time, has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise when he meets, in a Christian cemetery, the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva ([[Om Prakash]]), appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He says that on Christmas several years before, his three sons drank poisoned [[moonshine]], and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him and called him crazy, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen.\n\nAfter hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala that he would not take any more revenge on the lowlifes of the town. Eventually, along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him, and says he must do what is right.\n\nThe trail of tainted [[moonshine]] leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on [[Diwali]], [[fireworks]] bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognisable by the zanjeer on his wrist. Sher Khan helps him to fight Teja and his men, and take justice into their own hands, until the police arrive. When the hapless police inspector is held at gunpoint by Teja, Vijay manages to drop to retrieve a pistol from the ground, and shoots him dead, his body falling into the swimming pool.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor/Actress !!Character/Role !!Notes\n|-\n|[[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n|Insp.

The film changed [[Hindi cinema's]] trend from [[romance films]] to [[action films]], and pioneered [[Bachchan's]] new image of a brooding but explosive person who fights back when cornered, known as \"The Angry Young Man.\"\n\nThe film started a new wave in [[Bollywood]]. At a time when [[India]] was suffering from corruption and low economic growth, and the common man was left with frustration and anger over the system, ''[[Zanjeer]]'' began shifting Hindi cinema in a violent and aggressive direction. Reflecting the anger of the masses, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] was seen as the new hero, who had the courage to fight against the wrongs while maintaining moral values at the same time. This film also ended the struggling period for [[Bachchan]], and turned him into a rising star. The film was a [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|blockbuster success]], [[domestically in India]] and [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|overseas in]] the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIt was the first of many collaborations between screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Ever since ''[[Zanjeer]]'', [[Salim-Javed]] wrote many of their subsequent scripts with [[Bachchan]] in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), establishing [[Bachchan]] as a superstar.<ref name=\"hindustantimes\" /> In addition to being a turning point for [[Bachchan's]] career and Hindi cinema, ''[[Zanjeer]]'' was also a turning point for [[South Indian cinema]], with [[Bachchan's]] acting inspiring future [[Tamil]] [[Superstar Rajinikanth]].<ref name=\"indianexpress\" /> ''[[Zanjeer]]'' remains an important film in the history of [[Indian cinema]] and is regarded as a classic today.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on [[Diwali]] with the murder of young Vijay Khanna's parents, committed by a man of unknown identity with a white horse on his charm bracelet, \"zanjeer\". Because of this traumatic event, Vijay has recurring [[nightmare]]s of a white [[stallion]]. Even as a child Vijay stays socially awkward and stays away from the other kids, showing the audience that he believes himself to be alone. Fast forward 20 years, and Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is now an inspector, an honest police officer in a town where few are just. He receives complaints about a local man, Sher Khan (Pathan) ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), who is running gambling dens. When he calls Khan in for questioning, Khan's superiority complex chafes against Khanna's police authority, as he scolds the officer, telling him he only orders him around due to the uniform he wears. Vijay takes him up on his challenge, and meets him in street clothes to fight him. At fight's end, Sher Khan not only closes his gambling dens, but has gained respect for Vijay. He becomes an [[auto mechanic]], and reforms his ways.\n\nVarious dealings of the underworld continue unabated throughout the town, all tracing back to [[gang]] leader Teja ([[Ajit Khan]]). A mysterious caller continually phones Inspector Khanna to inform him exactly when a crime is about to take place, but hangs up before Khanna can extract any more information out of him. When a traffic accident perpetrated by gang members leaves several children dead, a witness, a street performer named Mala ([[Jaya Bhaduri]]), is bribed by Teja's men to keep quiet. When she is questioned by Vijay, he becomes enraged at her denying she knows anything, and, to sway her differently, takes her into the [[morgue]] to view the mangled bodies of the children. She has a change of heart, and comes clean, asking that the bribe be donated to an [[orphanage]]. She identifies the man behind the traffic accident.\n\nOnce it is known that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men come after her. She is chased through the night, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and coming to Inspector Khanna's house, desperate for shelter. He lets her in, allows her to stay, and the two discover that they are both [[orphans]], and discuss the fears associated with living alone. Khanna kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep house, as well as English, and other refinements.\n\nEventually, Vijay is framed for bribery, stripped of his title and position as inspector, and jailed for 6 months on false charges, trapped by Teja. When he is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala, by this time, has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise when he meets, in a Christian cemetery, the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva ([[Om Prakash]]), appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He says that on Christmas several years before, his three sons drank poisoned [[moonshine]], and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him and called him crazy, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen.\n\nAfter hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala that he would not take any more revenge on the lowlifes of the town. Eventually, along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him, and says he must do what is right.\n\nThe trail of tainted [[moonshine]] leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on [[Diwali]], [[fireworks]] bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognisable by the zanjeer on his wrist. Sher Khan helps him to fight Teja and his men, and take justice into their own hands, until the police arrive. When the hapless police inspector is held at gunpoint by Teja, Vijay manages to drop to retrieve a pistol from the ground, and shoots him dead, his body falling into the swimming pool.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor/Actress !!Character/Role !!Notes\n|-\n|[[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n|Insp.

By taking a global approach to understanding chromatin function, Schreiber proposed a \u201csignaling network model\u201d of chromatin and compared it to an alternative view, the \u201chistone code hypothesis\u201d presented by Strahl and Allis.<ref name=ten>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schreiber SL, Bernstein BE |title=Signaling network model of chromatin |journal=Cell |volume=111 |issue=6 |pages=771\u20138 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12526804 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01196-0}}</ref> These studies shined a bright light on [[chromatin]] as a key gene expression regulatory element rather than simply a structural element used for DNA compaction.\n\n==Chemical biology==\nSchreiber applied small molecules to biology through the development of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS),<ref name=eleven>(a) {{cite journal |author=Schreiber SL |title=Target-oriented and diversity-oriented organic synthesis in drug discovery |journal=Science |volume=287 |issue=5460 |pages=1964\u20139 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10720315 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5460.1964|bibcode=2000Sci...287.1964S |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c743cced47081bead7feccd35aee462cd3f9f5b2 }} (b) {{cite journal |vauthors=Burke MD, Berger EM, Schreiber SL |title=Generating diverse skeletons of small molecules combinatorially |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5645 |pages=613\u20138 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14576427 |doi=10.1126/science.1089946|bibcode=2003Sci...302..613B |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ca1ec86d17a33273362ed32ebafdf70480c46977 }}  (c) {{cite journal |vauthors=Burke MD, Schreiber SL |title=A planning strategy for diversity-oriented synthesis |journal=Angewandte Chemie |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=46\u201358 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14694470 |doi=10.1002/anie.200300626}}</ref> chemical genetics,<ref name=twelve>\"The small-molecule approach to biology: Chemical genetics and diversity-oriented organic synthesis make possible the systematic exploration of biology\u201d, S L Schreiber, ''C&E News'', '''2003''', 81, 51-61.</ref> and ChemBank.<ref name=thirteen>{{cite journal |vauthors=Strausberg RL, Schreiber SL |title=From knowing to controlling: a path from genomics to drugs using small molecule probes |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5617 |pages=294\u20135 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12690189 |doi=10.1126/science.1083395|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230826 |bibcode=2003Sci...300..294S }}</ref> Schreiber has shown that DOS can produce small molecules distributed in defined ways in chemical space by virtue of their different skeletons and stereochemistry, and that it can provide chemical handles on products anticipating the need for follow-up chemistry using, for example, combinatorial synthesis and the so-called Build/Couple/Pair strategy of modular chemical synthesis.

This work led pharmaceutical company Merck, among others, to pursue anti-cancer drugs that target human kinesin-5. \n\nSchreiber has used small molecules to study three specific areas of biology, and then through the more general application of small molecules in biomedical research. Academic screening centers have been created that emulate the Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology and the Broad Institute; in the U.S., there has been a nationwide effort to expand this capability via the government-sponsored NIH Road Map. Chemistry departments have changed their names to include the term chemical biology and new journals have been introduced (Cell Chemical Biology, ChemBioChem, Nature Chemical Biology, ACS Chemical Biology]) to cover the field.  Schreiber has been involved in the founding of numerous biopharmaceutical companies whose research relies on chemical biology: Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX), Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARIA), Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc (INFI), Forma Therapeutics, H3 Biomedicine and Jnana Therapeutics.  These companies have produced new therapeutics in several disease areas, including [[cystic fibrosis]] and cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=Claire E.|last2=Elborn|first2=J.

It was released on January 25, 2000, by [[Virgin Records]]. \n\nD'Angelo recorded the album during 1998 and 1999 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, with an extensive line-up of musicians associated with the [[Soulquarians]] musical collective. Produced primarily by the singer, ''Voodoo'' features a loose, [[Groove (music)|groove]]-based [[funk]] sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album, ''[[Brown Sugar (D'Angelo album)|Brown Sugar]]'' (1995). Its lyrics explore themes of spirituality, love, sexuality, maturation, and fatherhood.\n\nFollowing heavy promotion and public anticipation, the album was met with commercial and critical success. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 320,000 copies in its first week, and spent 33 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with five singles, including the hit single \"[[Untitled (How Does It Feel)]]\", whose music video garnered D'Angelo mainstream attention and controversy. Upon its release, ''Voodoo'' received general acclaim from music critics and earned D'Angelo several accolades. It was named one of the year's best albums by numerous publications.\n\nD'Angelo promoted ''Voodoo'' with an international [[#The Voodoo Tour|supporting tour]] in late 2000. While successful early on, the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D'Angelo's personal frustrations.

It was released on January 25, 2000, by [[Virgin Records]]. \n\nD'Angelo recorded the album during 1998 and 1999 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, with an extensive line-up of musicians associated with the [[Soulquarians]] musical collective. Produced primarily by the singer, ''Voodoo'' features a loose, [[Groove (music)|groove]]-based [[funk]] sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album, ''[[Brown Sugar (D'Angelo album)|Brown Sugar]]'' (1995). Its lyrics explore themes of spirituality, love, sexuality, maturation, and fatherhood.\n\nFollowing heavy promotion and public anticipation, the album was met with commercial and critical success. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 320,000 copies in its first week, and spent 33 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with five singles, including the hit single \"[[Untitled (How Does It Feel)]]\", whose music video garnered D'Angelo mainstream attention and controversy. Upon its release, ''Voodoo'' received general acclaim from music critics and earned D'Angelo several accolades. It was named one of the year's best albums by numerous publications.\n\nD'Angelo promoted ''Voodoo'' with an international [[#The Voodoo Tour|supporting tour]] in late 2000. While successful early on, the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D'Angelo's personal frustrations. ''Voodoo'' has since been regarded by music writers as a creative milestone of the [[neo soul]] genre during its apex.<ref name=\"Dombal\"/><ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Jason|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/07/17/f-maxwell-neo-soul.html|title=Soul on Fire|publisher=[[CBC News]].

In 1430, an ancestor, also called Sir Robert Logan (d. 1439), and his wife Dame Katherine founded the monastery of St Anthony which was near [[South Leith Parish Church]] with an outlying chapel at [[Arthur's Seat]] in [[Holyrood Park]], which survives as a ruin.<ref>Roger, Charles, ''Historical Notices of St Anthony's Monastery, Leith and Reheasal of Events'' (Grampian Club, 1877), pp. 7, 28.</ref>\n\nRobert inherited [[Fast Castle]] and other lands near the border with England, as 'nephew' and heir of Elizabeth Martene, Lady Fastcastle, widow of Cuthbert Home who had fallen at [[Flodden Field]]. In the 1570s Robert was lord of half of the lands of Fastcastle, and Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus was lord of the other half.\n\nIn 1597 he surrendered a number of lands and rights connected to Fast Castle (but not the Castle itself), which he had inherited from George Ogilvy of Dunlugus, to the Hume of [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] family. The rights included the keeping of [[Berwick Castle]], which had not been in [[capture of Berwick (1482)|Scottish hands since 1482]].<ref>''HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn'' (London, 1902), p. 64.</ref> Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown.

On 29 July 1586, he wrote from Restalrig to [[Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas|Archibald Douglas]] in London, offering his service to [[Francis Walsingham]]. Logan conveyed letters secretly from England for the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]].<ref>''HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), nos. 312, 489.</ref>\n\nJames VI had hoped that Archibald Douglas, a Scotsman resident in London, but not an accredited ambassador, might be able to intervene and save his mother from execution after the revelation of the [[Babington plot]] in 1586. The Master of Gray and Logan corresponded with Douglas on this unofficial diplomacy. The Master of Gray's letters show that he was reluctant to become involved in a project with such doubtful outcomes, but he sent Logan to Douglas in December 1586. After he returned to Fast Castle, Logan wrote back to Douglas on 25 February 1587. By now Mary had been executed and James VI was angry with Gray's actions, and Logan told Douglas not to write to Gray anymore:<blockquote>\"he wryt to me, desirenge me to wryt to your Lordship that ye shuld wryt no moir to hem, for your letters doithe hem very muche harme, and he was no thenge the wisar of your intelligens.

It is possible that ''Nemegtosaurus'', also known from only skull material, is a very close relative of ''Quaesitosaurus'', if not indeed a variation of the same animal.\n|-\n|\n*\u2020''[[Rapetosaurus]]''\n:*\u2020''Rapetosaurus krausei''\n| 70\u201366 Ma\n| Maevarano Formation, Mahajanga Province, Madagascar\n| A nemegtosaurid that was fairly modest in size, for a titanosaur, being less than half the length of ''Argentinosaurus'' and ''[[Paralititan]]''.\n|-\n|\n*\u2020''[[Rocasaurus]]''\n:*\u2020''Rocasaurus muniozi''\n| 75-70\n| [[Allen Formation]], Rio Negro Province, Argentina\n|\n|-\n| \n*\u2020''[[Saltasaurus]]''\n:*\u2020''Saltasaurus loricatus''\n| 85-70 Ma\n| Lecho Formation, Salta Province, Argentina\nUruguay\n| A well-known saltasaurine saltasaurid. Relatively small among typically-sized sauropods, though still massive by the standards of modern terrestrial creatures, ''Saltasaurus'' is characterized by a diplodocid-like head (with blunt teeth, only in the front of the mouth). It was the first genus of sauropod known to possess armour of bony plates embedded in its skin. The small bony plates (osteoderms) have since been found on other titanosaurs. When the plates of a saltasaur were originally found, independently of skeletal remains, they were assumed to be from an ankylosaur, whose plates they resemble. A crest of scutes has also been discovered running down the back of diplodocid sauropods.\n|-\n| \n*\u2020''[[Titanosaurus]]''\n:*\u2020''Titanosaurus indicus''\n:*\u2020''Titanosaurus blandfordi''\n| 70 Ma\n| Lameta Formation, India\n| A dubious titanosaurid estimated to have grown up to {{convert|9|\u2013|12|m|abbr=on}} long and about 13 tons in weight. ''Titanosaurus'' has traditionally been treated as a \"[[Wastebasket taxon|wastebin taxon]]\" for poorly preserved sauropod remains that demonstrate a distinctive vertebrae anatomy. The original ''Titanosaurus'' remains consist only of limb bones and a few vertebrae that have these characteristics. However, discoveries of more and better-preserved titanosaur species have shown that these once distinctive features are in fact widespread across many genera. Therefore, ''Titanosaurus'' itself is considered a ''nomen dubium'' by most paleontologists, since the original ''Titanosaurus'' specimens cannot be distinguished from those of related genera.\n|-\n| \n*\u2020''[[Uberabatitan]]''\n:*\u2020''Uberabatitan ribeiroi''\n| 67 Ma\n| [[Marilia Formation]], [[Brazil]]\n| A little-known titanosaur known from specific bones including neck, back, and tail vertebrae, pelvic bones and limb bones.\n|-\n|\n*\u2020''[[Vahiny]]''\n:*\u2020''Vahiny depereti''\n| 70\u201366 Ma\n| Maevarano Formation, Mahajanga Province, Madagascar\n| A rare titanosaur coexisting with the more common ''Rapetosaurus''. It is distinguished from other titanosaurs by characteristics of its braincase, including the basal tubera, basipterygoid processes, parasphenoid, and cranial nerve foramina. Differences in the braincases of ''Vahiny'' and ''Rapetosaurus'' indicate that they are not closely related to one another. ''Vahiny'' is most similar to ''Jainosaurus'', and bears similarities to ''[[Muyelensaurus]]'' and ''[[Pitekunsaurus]]''.\n|}\n\n==[[Avialan]]s (avian theropods)==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n|- \n! colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |Birds of the Maastrichtian\n|-\n!

The skull fragments, left humerus, and other fossilized remains indicate it was among the largest pterosaurs, very similar (almost identical) to ''Quetzalcoatlus''. The authors estimated the size of ''Hatzegopteryx'' by comparing the humerus fragment, {{convert|236|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, with that of ''Quetzalcoatlus'', of which one specimen has a {{convert|544|mm|ftin|abbr=on}} long humerus. Observing that the ''Hatzegopteryx'' fragment presented less than half of the original bone, they established that it could possibly have been \"slightly longer\" than that of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. They noted that the wing span of the latter had in 1981 been estimated at {{convert|11|to|12|m|sp=us}}, while earlier estimates had strongly exceeded this at {{convert|15|to|20|m|sp=us}}. From this they concluded that an estimate of a {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} wingspan for ''Hatzegopteryx'' was conservative if its humerus was indeed somewhat longer than that of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. In 2003 they moderated the estimates to a close to {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} wing span and an over {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|abbr=off|sp=us}} skull length. In 2010 Mark Witton e.a. stated that any appearance that the ''Hatzegopteryx'' humerus was bigger than TMM 41450\u20133 had been caused by a distortion of the bone after deposition and that the species thus likely had no larger wingspan than ''Quetzalcoatlus'', today generally estimated at {{convert|10|to|11|m|sp=us}}.\n|-\n|\n*\u2020''[[Navajodactylus]]''\n#\u2020''Navajodactylus boerei''\n| 75.56\u201374.44 Ma, Campanian to Maastrichtian\n| Kirtland Formation, New Mexico, USA\n| A pterosaur of uncertain affinities with an estimated wingspan of {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}}.

Alongside ''Q. northropi'', a second species exists without an official specific name yet, currently called ''Quetzalcoatlus sp.''. One of the largest-known flying animals of all time, it had a stork-like lifestyle. When it was first discovered, scientists estimated that the largest ''Quetzalcoatlus'' fossils came from an individual with a wingspan as large as {{convert|15.9|m|abbr=on}}, choosing the middle of three extrapolations from the proportions of other pterosaurs that gave an estimate of 11, 15.5 and 21 meters, respectively (36 feet, 50.85 feet, 68.9 feet). In 1981, further study lowered these estimates to {{convert|11|\u2013|12|m|abbr=on}}. More recent estimates based on greater knowledge of azhdarchid proportions place its wingspan at {{convert|10|\u2013|11|m|sp=us}}.

Relatively small among typically-sized sauropods, though still massive by the standards of modern terrestrial creatures, ''Saltasaurus'' is characterized by a diplodocid-like head (with blunt teeth, only in the front of the mouth). It was the first genus of sauropod known to possess armour of bony plates embedded in its skin. The small bony plates (osteoderms) have since been found on other titanosaurs. When the plates of a saltasaur were originally found, independently of skeletal remains, they were assumed to be from an ankylosaur, whose plates they resemble.

''Titanosaurus'' has traditionally been treated as a \"[[Wastebasket taxon|wastebin taxon]]\" for poorly preserved sauropod remains that demonstrate a distinctive vertebrae anatomy. The original ''Titanosaurus'' remains consist only of limb bones and a few vertebrae that have these characteristics. However, discoveries of more and better-preserved titanosaur species have shown that these once distinctive features are in fact widespread across many genera. Therefore, ''Titanosaurus'' itself is considered a ''nomen dubium'' by most paleontologists, since the original ''Titanosaurus'' specimens cannot be distinguished from those of related genera.\n|-\n| \n*\u2020''[[Uberabatitan]]''\n:*\u2020''Uberabatitan ribeiroi''\n| 67 Ma\n| [[Marilia Formation]], [[Brazil]]\n| A little-known titanosaur known from specific bones including neck, back, and tail vertebrae, pelvic bones and limb bones.\n|-\n|\n*\u2020''[[Vahiny]]''\n:*\u2020''Vahiny depereti''\n| 70\u201366 Ma\n| Maevarano Formation, Mahajanga Province, Madagascar\n| A rare titanosaur coexisting with the more common ''Rapetosaurus''.

The skull fragments, left humerus, and other fossilized remains indicate it was among the largest pterosaurs, very similar (almost identical) to ''Quetzalcoatlus''. The authors estimated the size of ''Hatzegopteryx'' by comparing the humerus fragment, {{convert|236|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, with that of ''Quetzalcoatlus'', of which one specimen has a {{convert|544|mm|ftin|abbr=on}} long humerus. Observing that the ''Hatzegopteryx'' fragment presented less than half of the original bone, they established that it could possibly have been \"slightly longer\" than that of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. They noted that the wing span of the latter had in 1981 been estimated at {{convert|11|to|12|m|sp=us}}, while earlier estimates had strongly exceeded this at {{convert|15|to|20|m|sp=us}}. From this they concluded that an estimate of a {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} wingspan for ''Hatzegopteryx'' was conservative if its humerus was indeed somewhat longer than that of ''Quetzalcoatlus''. In 2003 they moderated the estimates to a close to {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} wing span and an over {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|abbr=off|sp=us}} skull length. In 2010 Mark Witton e.a. stated that any appearance that the ''Hatzegopteryx'' humerus was bigger than TMM 41450\u20133 had been caused by a distortion of the bone after deposition and that the species thus likely had no larger wingspan than ''Quetzalcoatlus'', today generally estimated at {{convert|10|to|11|m|sp=us}}.\n|-\n|\n*\u2020''[[Navajodactylus]]''\n#\u2020''Navajodactylus boerei''\n| 75.56\u201374.44 Ma, Campanian to Maastrichtian\n| Kirtland Formation, New Mexico, USA\n| A pterosaur of uncertain affinities with an estimated wingspan of {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}}.

The cervical vertebrae are thought to be a series from the fifth (the longest with a length of thirty centimeters) to the ninth.

Alongside ''Q. northropi'', a second species exists without an official specific name yet, currently called ''Quetzalcoatlus sp.''. One of the largest-known flying animals of all time, it had a stork-like lifestyle. When it was first discovered, scientists estimated that the largest ''Quetzalcoatlus'' fossils came from an individual with a wingspan as large as {{convert|15.9|m|abbr=on}}, choosing the middle of three extrapolations from the proportions of other pterosaurs that gave an estimate of 11, 15.5 and 21 meters, respectively (36 feet, 50.85 feet, 68.9 feet). In 1981, further study lowered these estimates to {{convert|11|\u2013|12|m|abbr=on}}. More recent estimates based on greater knowledge of azhdarchid proportions place its wingspan at {{convert|10|\u2013|11|m|sp=us}}.

In apparent contrast, Burke distinguished and deplored the process of the French revolution in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), as in this case property, customary and religious rights were being removed summarily by the revolutionaries and not by the crown.

He belonged to the [[Florentine painting|Florentine School]] under the patronage of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], a movement that [[Giorgio Vasari]] would characterize less than a hundred years later in his ''Vita'' of Botticelli as a \"[[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]]\". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th  century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.\n\nAs well as the small number of mythological subjects which are his best known works today, he painted a wide range of religious subjects and also some portraits. He and his workshop were especially known for their ''Madonna and Child''s, many in the round [[tondo (art)|tondo]] shape.  Botticelli's best-known works are ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', both in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence.  He lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence, with probably his only significant time elsewhere the months he spent painting in [[Pisa]] in 1474 and the [[Sistine Chapel]] in Rome in 1481\u201382.<ref>Ettlingers, 199; Lightbown, 53 on the Pisa work, which does not survive</ref> \n\nOnly one of his paintings is dated, though others can be dated from other records with varying degrees of certainty, and the development of his style traced with confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, growing in mastery and reputation, and the 1480s were his most successful decade, when all his large mythological paintings were done, and many of his best Madonnas.  By the 1490s his style became more personal and to some extent mannered, and he could be seen as moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and a new generation of painters creating the [[High Renaissance]] style as Botticelli returned in some ways to the Gothic style.\n\nHe has been described as \"an outsider in the mainstream of Italian painting\", who had a limited interest in many of the developments most associated with [[Quattrocento]] painting, such as the realistic depiction of human anatomy, perspective, and landscape, and the use of direct borrowings from classical art.  His training enabled him to represent all these aspects of painting, without adopting or contributing to their development.<ref>Ettlingers, 199\u2013204, 203 quoted</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Via borgo ognissanti.JPG|thumb|Via Borgo Ognissanti in 2008, with the eponymous church halfway down on the right. Like the street, it has had a Baroque makeover since Botticelli's time.]]\nBotticelli was born in the city of [[Florence]] in a house in the street still called Via Borgo Ognissanti.  He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] (\"All Saints\") parish church.  His father was Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi, and Sandro was the youngest of his four children to survive into adulthood, all boys.<ref>Lightbown, 17\u201319</ref> The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458 so, allowing for arguments as to what these statements really meant, dates between 1444 and 1446 are given.<ref name=\"auto8\">Ettlingers, 7</ref>  \n\nHis father was a tanner until 1460, before joining his son Antonio in a new business as a beater-out of [[gold leaf]], which would have brought them into contact with artists.<ref>Lightbown, 19</ref> [[Giorgio Vasari]] reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a [[goldsmith]].<ref>He was still in school in February 1458 (Lightbown, 19). According to Vasari, 147, he was an able pupil, but easily grew restless, and was initially apprenticed as a goldsmith.</ref> He perhaps became an apprentice when he was about fourteen years old, which may indicate that he received a fuller education than many other Renaissance artists.  \n\nThe Ognissanti neighbourhood was mostly \"a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen,\"<ref name=\"auto1\">Lightbown, 18</ref> but there were some rich families, notably the very rich Rucellai, bankers and wool-merchants, headed by [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai]], whose [[Palazzo Rucellai]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]], a landmark in [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], was being built between about 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years.  By 1458, Botticelli's family had moved to the same street as this, and were renting their house from another Rucellai, and there were other dealings involving the two families.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1464, his father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro returned to live in from 1470 (if not before) and where he remained for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"auto9\">Lightbown, 18\u201319</ref> He both lived and had his workshop in the house, by now a rather unusual practice, despite his brother Giovanni and his family also being in residence (and later another brother, Simone).<ref>Ettlingers, 12</ref> Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including [[Amerigo Vespucci]], born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named.  The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The name Botticelli, meaning \"little barrel\", came from his brother Giovanni's nickname of \"Botticello\", \"apparently from an unfortunate resemblance\".  By 1470 a document referred to the painter as \"Sandro Mariano Botticelli\", and it became his customary surname.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> \n[[File:Botticelli 04 Louvre.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist'', c. 1470\u20131475, [[Louvre]]]]\n\n==Career before Rome==\nFrom around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to [[Filippo Lippi|Fra Filippo Lippi]], one of the top Florentine painters of the day, and one often patronized by the Medicis.  He was rather conservative in many respects, but gave Botticelli a solid training in the Florentine style and technique of the day, in panel painting, [[fresco]], and drawing.  Botticelli's paintings avoided technical short-cuts throughout his life, and when well treated they have survived in good condition for their age.   Elements in style and compositions that are reminiscent of Lippi also continue to appear throughout his career.<ref>Lightbown, 20\u201326</ref> For this period Lippi was in fact based in [[Prato]], just outside Florence, painting what is now [[Prato Cathedral]], and it is there that Botticelli was trained.  He had probably left Lippi by April 1467, when the master went to work in [[Spoleto]].<ref>Lightbown, 22, 25</ref>  \n\nIn the past there was speculation that he had also had a period in a more progressive workshop, and both that of the [[Pollaiuolo brothers]] and [[Verrochio]] have been suggested, based on some undoubted influence these had on Botticelli's style.  Current thinking is that no actual period in a different workshop is needed to account for this.<ref>Lightbown, 26; but see Hartt, 324, saying \"Botticelli was active in the shop of Verrocchio\".</ref>  \n\nLippi died in 1469 and by 1470 at the latest, but probably a year or two earlier, Botticelli had his own workshop, which by 1472 included the young [[Filippino Lippi]], son of his master.<ref>Dempsey, Hartt, 324; Legouix, 8</ref> In June of that year he was commissioned by the judges of commercial cases to paint two panels from a set of the [[Seven Virtues]] for their court;<ref>Lightbown, 52; they were the ''Sei della Mercanzia'', a tribunal of six judges, chosen by the main [[Guilds of Florence]].</ref> for some reason, only one, ''Fortitude'' (now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]]) was finished.  Botticelli both matched his style and composition to the other panels by [[Piero del Pollaiuolo]], and tried to outshine him \"with fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention.\"<ref>Lightbown, 46 (quoted); Ettlingers, 19\u201322</ref> \n\nThere is often uncertainty in distinguishing between the contributions of Botticelli, the Lippis, and other pupils and imitators of Botticelli.  Especially in smaller works such as Madonnas, all the leading painters were copied or imitated by their own workshops and a host of unidentified lesser artists.<ref>Ettlingers, 17\u201318</ref> Influenced also by the monumentality of [[Masaccio]]'s painting, it was from Lippi that Botticelli learned a more intimate and detailed manner.  Even at this early date, his work was characterized by a conception of the figure as if seen in low relief, drawn with clear contours, and minimizing strong contrasts of light and shadow which would indicate fully modelled forms. Lippi's synthesis of the new control of three-dimensional forms, tender expressiveness in face and gesture, and decorative details inherited from the late Gothic style were the strongest influences on Botticelli. A different influence was the new sculptural monumentality of the Pollaiuolo brothers.<ref>Ettlingers, 18</ref>\n\n===Key early paintings===\nA large ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' altarpiece of about 1470\u201372 is in the Uffizi. It is not in good condition, but shows Botticelli had mastered the posing of a group of eight figures \"with a skillful semblance of easy naturalness in a closed architectural setting\".<ref>Lightbown, 50</ref> One work that can be firmly dated is the narrow  ''[[St. Sebastian (Botticelli)|Saint Sebastian]]'' made for a pier in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] and dedicated in January 1474; it is now in Berlin.<ref>Lightbown, 50\u201351</ref> This was painted at the same time as the Pollaiuolo brothers' much larger altarpiece of the same saint, a showpiece of anatomical poses, with the saint shown in great pain.<ref>[[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 003 cropframe.JPG|the Pollaiuolo brothers' painting, now National Gallery, London]]</ref> Though very similar in pose, no doubt after Botticelli had seen the other painting, Botticelli's Sebastian seems calm and poised, following the legend that the arrows did not kill Sebastian, whose wounds were miraculously healed.  The almost nude body is very carefully drawn; usually Botticelli was not greatly concerned with anatomical precision, and he painted relatively few nudes, though some are among his most famous works.  The delicate winter landscape, reflecting the traditional date of the saint's martyrdom and feast-day in January, is also one of Botticelli's more impressive efforts.<ref>Lightbown, 51\u201352; Ettlingers, 22\u201323</ref>     \n\nAt the start of 1474 Botticelli was asked by the authorities in Pisa to join the work frescoing the [[Camposanto]], a huge and prestigious project mostly being done by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], who spent nearly twenty years on it.  Various payments up to September are recorded, but no work survives, and it seems that whatever Botticelli started was not finished.  Whatever the outcome, that Botticelli was approached from outside Florence demonstrates a growing reputation.<ref>Lightbown, 52</ref>  \n[[File:Zanobi-Altar.jpg|thumb|''[[Adoration of the Magi (Botticelli, 1475)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', 1475, 111 cm \u00d7 134&nbsp;cm (44 in \u00d7 53 in)]]\n\nThe ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Botticelli, 1475)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for [[Santa Maria Novella]] (c. 1475\u201376, now in the [[Uffizi]], and the first of 8 ''Adorations''),<ref>Hartt, 324</ref> was singled out for praise by Vasari, and was in a much-visited church, so spreading his reputation.  It can be thought of as marking the climax of Botticelli's early style.  Despite being commissioned by a money-changer, or perhaps money-lender, not otherwise known as an ally of the Medici, it contains the portraits of [[Cosimo de Medici]], his sons [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]] and [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni]] (all these by now dead), and his grandsons [[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo]] and [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]].  There are also portraits of the donor and, in the view of most, Botticelli himself, standing at the front on the right.  The painting was celebrated for the variety of the angles from which the faces are painted, and of their expressions.<ref>Lightbown, 65\u201369; Vasari, 150\u2013152; Hartt, 324\u2013325</ref>\n\nA large [[fresco]] for the customs house of Florence, that is now lost, depicted the execution by [[hanging]] of the leaders of the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 against the Medici.  It was a Florentine custom to humiliate traitors in this way, by the so-called \"''[[pittura infamante]]''\".<ref>Ettlingers, 10</ref> This was Botticelli's first major fresco commission (apart from the abortive Pisa excursion), and may have led to his summons to Rome.  The figure of [[Francesco Salviati (bishop)|Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa]] was removed in 1479, after protests from the Pope, and the rest were destroyed after the expulsion of the Medici and return of the [[Pazzi family]] in 1494.<ref>Hartt, 325\u2013326; Ettlingers, 10; Dempsey</ref> Another lost work was a [[tondo (art)|tondo]] of the Madonna ordered by a Florentine banker in Rome to present to Cardinal [[Francesco Gonzaga (1444\u20131483)|Francesco Gonzaga]]; this perhaps spread awareness of his work to Rome.  A fresco in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], headquarters of the Florentine state, was lost in the next century when Vasari remodelled the building.<ref>Lightbown, 70</ref> \n\nIn 1480 the Vespucci family commissioned a fresco figure of ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine]]'' for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's.  Someone else, probably the order running the church,<ref>Lightbown, 77</ref> commissioned [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] to do a facing ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|Saint Jerome]]''; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects.  As in other cases, such direct competition \"was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers\", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lighbown.<ref>Lightbown, 73\u201378, 74 quoted</ref> The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known.  Most of the \"text\" is scribbles, but one line reads: \"Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato\", probably dialogue overheard from  the [[Humiliati|Uumiliati]], the order who ran the church.  Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought \"the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them\".<ref>Lightbown, 77 (different translation to same effect)</ref>\n  \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Sandro Botticelli Madonna and Child with Six Saints 01.jpg|''[[Sacra conversazione]]'' altarpiece, c. 1470-72, [[Uffizi]], called the ''Pala di Sant'Ambrogio''\nFile:Sandro Botticelli 054.jpg|''[[St. Sebastian (Botticelli)|St. Sebastian]]'', 1474\nFile:Sandro Botticelli - Mary with the Child and Singing Angels - Google Art Project.jpg|''Madonna with Lillies and Eight Angels'', c.&nbsp;1478\nFile:Sandro Botticelli 050.jpg|Fresco ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine]]'', Ognissanti, 1480\n</gallery>\n\n==Sistine Chapel==\n[[File:Eventos de la vida de Mois\u00e9s (Sandro Botticelli).jpg|thumb|380px|left|''[[Youth of Moses]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\nIn 1481, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of the newly completed [[Sistine Chapel]].  This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel; most of the frescos remain, but are now greatly overshadowed and disrupted by [[Michelangelo]]'s work of the next century, to make room for which some of them were destroyed.<ref>Shearman, 38\u201342, 47; Lightbown, 90\u201392; Hartt, 326</ref> The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy.  After Sixtus was implicated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] hostilities had escalated into [[excommunication]] for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small \"Pazzi War\".<ref>Shearman, 47; Hartt, 326; Martines, Chapter 10 for the hostilities.</ref>  \n\nThe iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] and the ''Life of [[Moses]]'', together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy.  Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the [[Temptations of Christ (Botticelli)|''Temptations of Christ'']], ''[[Youth of Moses]]'' and ''[[Punishment of the Sons of Corah]]'' (or various other titles),<ref>Shearman, 70\u201375; Hartt, 326\u2013327</ref> as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the [[lunette]]s above, where Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] now is.  He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed.<ref>Shearman, 47</ref> Each painter bought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.<ref>Hartt, 327; Shearman, 47</ref>\n[[File:Botticcelli, Sandro - The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron - 1481-82.jpg|thumb|''[[Punishment of the Sons of Corah]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\n\nVasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that [[Pietro Perugino]], the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was.<ref>Hartt, 326\u2013327; Lightbown, 92\u201394, thinks no one was, but that Botticelli set the style for the figures of the popes.</ref> The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities.  The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene.  Allowing for the painted [[pilaster]]s that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes.<ref>Lightbown, 90\u201392, 97\u201399, 105\u2013106; Hartt, 327; Shearman, 47, 50\u201375</ref>  \n\nBotticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent [[triptych]]-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents.<ref>Hartt, 327</ref> In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the ''Youth of Moses''.<ref>Lightbown, 99\u2013105</ref> The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored.<ref>Lightbown, 96\u201397</ref>    \n\nThe ''Punishment of the Sons of Corah'' contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work.  This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]''.<ref>Lightbown, 106\u2013108; Ettlingers, 202</ref> If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an ''Adoration of the Magi'', now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.<ref>Lightbown, 111\u2013113</ref> In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedalletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded.  He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482.<ref>Lightbown, 90, 94</ref>\n\n==Mythological subjects of the 1480s==\n[[File:Botticelli-primavera.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' (c. 1482), icon of the springtime renewal of the Florentine Renaissance.

[[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]\nThe masterpieces ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' (c. 1482) and ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the [[Uffizi]].  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.  Together with the smaller and less celebrated [[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|''Venus and Mars'']] and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', they have been endlessly analysed by [[art historian]]s, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]], and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures.<ref>Covered at length in: Lightbown, Ch. 7 & 8; Wind, Ch. V, VII and VIII; Ettlingers, Ch. 3; Dempsey; Hartt, 329\u2013334</ref> \n\nThough all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity.  All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary [[Renaissance humanist]]s. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying \"grace\" and by [[John Ruskin]] as possessing linear rhythm.  The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colors.<ref name=Lightbown/>\n\nThe ''Primavera'' and the ''Birth'' were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the [[Villa di Castello]], owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/5allegor/20pallas.html|title=Web Gallery of Art, searchable fine arts image database|website=www.wga.hu}}</ref> it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the ''Primavera'' was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and ''The Birth of Venus'' was commissioned by someone else for a different site.<ref>Lightbown, 122\u2013123; 152\u2013153; Smith, Webster, \"On the Original Location of the Primavera\", ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', vol. 57, no. 1, 1975, pp. 31\u201340.

A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'' in the National Gallery, London.  This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a ''[[spalliera]]'', a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wood panelling.  The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms.  Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant [[satyr]]s play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a [[conch shell]] in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber.<ref>Lightbown, 164\u2013168; Dempsey; Ettlingers, 138\u2013141, with a later date.</ref>\n\nThree of these four large mythologies feature [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], a central figure in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]], which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity.  The fourth, ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'' is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress. The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason.<ref>Lightbown, 148\u2013152; Legouix, 113</ref>\n\n==Religious paintings after Rome==\nBotticelli returned from Rome in 1482 with a reputation considerably enhanced by his work there.  As with his secular paintings, many religious commissions are larger and no doubt more expensive than before.<ref>Lightbown, 180</ref> Altogether more datable works by Botticelli come from the 1480s than any other decade,<ref name=\"auto3\">Dempsey</ref> and most of these are religious.  By the mid-1480s, many leading Florentine artists had left the city, some never to return.  The rising star [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who scoffed at Botticelli's landscapes,<ref>Hartt, 329. According to Leonardo, Botticelli anticipated the method of some 18th century [[watercolour]]ists by claiming that a landscape could be begun by throwing a sponge loaded with paint at the panel.</ref> left in 1481 for [[Milan]], the Pollaiolo brothers in 1484 for Rome, and [[Andrea Verrochio]] in 1485 for [[Venice]].<ref name=\"auto4\">Ettlingers, 11</ref>  \n\nThe remaining leaders of Florentine painting, Botticelli, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Filippino Lippi]], worked on a major fresco cycle with [[Perugino]], for [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]]'s villa at Spedalletto near [[Volterra]].<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Botticelli painted many Madonnas, covered in a section below, and [[altarpiece]]s and frescos in Florentine churches. In 1491 he served on a committee to decide upon a fa\u00e7ade for the [[Cathedral of Florence]], receiving the next year a small payment for a design for a scheme, eventually abortive, to put [[mosaic]]s on some interior roof vaults in the cathedral.<ref>Lightbown, 211\u2013213</ref>\n\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Madonna with Saints - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The ''Bardi Altarpiece'', 1484\u201385, 185 x 180 cm]]\n===''Bardi Altarpiece''===\nThe first major church commission after Rome was the '''''Bardi Altarpiece''''', finished and framed by February 1485,<ref>Lightbown, 182</ref> and now in Berlin. The frame was by no less a figure than [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], who was just becoming Lorenzo il Magnifico's favourite architect.  An enthroned Madonna and (rather large) Child sit on an elaborately-carved raised stone bench in a garden, with plants and flowers behind them closing off all but small patches of sky, to give a version of the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' or closed garden, a very traditional setting for the Virgin Mary. Saints [[John the Baptist]] and an unusually elderly [[John the Evangelist]] stand in the foreground. Small and inconspicuous [[banderole]]s or ribbons carrying biblical verses elucidate the rather complex theological meaning of the work, for which Botticelli must have had a clerical advisor, but do not intrude on a simpler appreciation of the painting and its lovingly detailed rendering, which Vasari praised.<ref>Lightbown, 180\u2013185; Ettlingers, 72\u201374</ref> It is somewhat typical of Botticelli's relaxed approach to strict perspective that the top ledge of the bench is seen from above, but the vases with lilies on it from below.<ref>Legouix, 38</ref>\n\nThe donor, from the leading [[Bardi family]], had returned to Florence from over twenty years as a banker and wool merchant in London, where he was known as \"John de Barde\",<ref>Lightbown, 180; Ettlingers, 73</ref> and aspects of the painting may reflect north European and even English art and popular devotional trends.<ref>Lightbown, 184</ref> There may have been other panels in the altarpiece, which are now missing.<ref>Ettlingers, 73</ref>\n\n[[File:Botticelli, pala di san barnaba 01.jpg|thumb|''San Barnaba Altarpiece'', c. 1487, Uffizi, 268 x 280 cm]]\n===''San Barnaba Altarpiece''===\nA larger and more crowded altarpiece is the '''''San Barnaba Altarpiece''''' of about 1487, now in the Uffizi, where elements of Botticelli's emotional late style begin to appear.  Here the setting is a palatial heavenly interior in the latest style, showing Botticelli taking a new degree of interest in architecture, possibly influenced by Sangallo. The Virgin and Child are raised high on a throne, at the same level as four angels carrying the [[Instruments of the Passion]].  Six saints stand in line below the throne.  Several figures have rather large heads, and the infant Jesus is again very large.  While the faces of the Virgin, child and angels have the linear beauty of his tondos, the saints are given varied and intense expressions.  Four small and rather simple ''[[predella]]'' panels survive; there were probably originally seven.<ref>Lightbown, 187\u2013190; Legouix, 31, 42</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nWith the phase of painting large secular works probably over by the late 1480s, Botticelli painted several altarpieces, and this appears to have been a peak period for his workshop's production of Madonnas. Botticelli's largest altarpiece, the ''San Marco Altarpiece'' (378 x 258 cm, Uffizi), is the only one to remain with its full ''predella'', of five panels.  In the air above four saints, the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' is taking place in a heavenly zone of gold and bright colours that recall his earlier works, with encircling angels dancing and throwing flowers.<ref>Lightbown, 198\u2013200; Legouix, 42\u201344</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the ''[[Cestello Annunciation]]'' (1489\u201390, Uffizi) forms a natural grouping with other late paintings, especially two of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] that share its sombre background colouring, and the rather exaggerated expressiveness of the bending poses of the figures.  It does have an unusually detailed landscape, still in dark colours, seen through the window, which seems to draw on north European models, perhaps from prints.<ref>Lightbown, 194\u2013198; Legouix, 103</ref>  \n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 016.jpg|thumb|''[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli)|Lamentation of Christ]]'', early 1490s, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.]]\n\nOf the two ''Lamentations'', [[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Milan)|one]] is in an unusual vertical format, because, like his 1474 ''Saint Sebastian'', it was painted for the side of a pillar in the Church of [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence]]; it is now in Milan.  [[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Munich)|The other, horizontal, one]] was painted for a chapel on the corner of Botticelli's street; it is now in Munich.  In both the crowded, intertwined figures around the dead Christ take up nearly all the picture space, with only bare rock behind.  The [[Swoon of the Virgin|Virgin has swooned]], and the other figures form a scrum to support her and Christ.<ref>Lightbown, 207\u2013209; Legouix, 107, 109</ref> The Munich painting has three less involved saints with attributes (somewhat oddly including [[Saint Peter]], usually regarded as in [[Jerusalem]] on the day, but not present at this scene), and gives the figures (except Christ) flat halos shown in perspective, which from now on Botticelli often uses.  Both probably date from 1490 to 1495.<ref>Lightbown dates the Munich picture to 1490\u201392, and the Milan one to c. 1495</ref>\n\nEarly records mentioned, without describing it, an altarpiece by Botticelli for the Convertite, an institution for ex-prostitutes, and various surviving unprovenanced works were proposed as candidates. It is now generally accepted that a painting in the [[Courtauld Gallery]] in London is the ''[[Pala delle Convertite]]'', dating to about 1491\u201393.  Its subject, unusual for an altarpiece, is the [[Holy Trinity]], with Christ on the cross, supported from behind by God the Father.  Angels surround the Trinity, which is flanked by two saints, with [[Book of Tobit|Tobias and the Angel]] on a far smaller scale right in the foreground.  This was probably a [[votive offering|votive]] addition, perhaps requested by the original donor.  The four predella scenes, showing the life of [[Mary Magdalen]], then taken as a reformed prostitute herself, are in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].<ref>Lightbown, 202\u2013207</ref> \n\nAfter about 1493 or 1495 Botticelli seems to have painted no more large religious paintings, though production of Madonnas probably continued. The smaller narrative religious scenes of the last years are covered below.\n  \n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Botticelli, incoronazione della vergine.jpg|''San Marco Altarpiece'', c. 1490-93, 378 x 258 cm, Uffizi\nFile:Botticelli, annunciazione di cestello 02.jpg|''[[Cestello Annunciation]]'', 1489-90, 150 x 156 cm, Uffizi\nFile:Sandro Botticelli 015.jpg|[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Milan)|''Lamentation over the Dead Christ'']], Milan\nFile:Botticelli Trinity.jpg|''[[Pala delle Convertite]]'', c. 1491-93, [[Courtauld Gallery]], London \n</gallery>\n\n==Madonnas, and tondos==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Madonna del Magnificat - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', c. 1483]]\nPaintings of the [[Madonna and Child]], that is, the [[Virgin Mary]] and infant [[Jesus]], were enormously popular in 15th-century Italy in a range of sizes and formats, from large altarpieces of the ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' type to small paintings for the home.  They also often hung in offices, public buildings, shops and clerical institutions. These smaller paintings were a steady source of income for painters at all levels of quality, and many were probably produced for stock, without a specific commission.<ref name=\"auto7\">Lightbown, 82</ref> \n\nBotticelli painted Madonnas from the start of his career until at least the 1490s. He was one of the first painters to use the round [[tondo (art)|tondo]] format, with the painted area typically some 115 to 145 cm across (about four to five feet).  This format was more associated with paintings for palaces than churches, though they were large enough to be hung in churches, and some were later donated to them.<ref>Lightbown, 47</ref> Several Madonnas use this format, usually with a seated Virgin shown down to the knees, and though rectangular pictures of the Madonna outnumber them, Madonnas in tondo form are especially associated with Botticelli.  He used the tondo format for other subjects, such as an early ''Adoration of the Magi'' in London,<ref>Lightbown, 47\u201350</ref> and was apparently more likely to paint a tondo Madonna himself, usually leaving rectangular ones to his workshop.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\nBotticelli's Virgins are always beautiful, in the same idealized way as his mythological figures, and often richly dressed in contemporary style.  Although [[Savonarola]]'s main strictures were against secular art, he also complained of the paintings in Florentine churches that \"You have made the Virgin appear dressed as a whore\",<ref name=\"auto3\"/> which may have had an effect on Botticelli's style.  They are often accompanied by equally beautiful angels, or an infant Saint [[John the Baptist]] (the patron saint of Florence).  Some feature flowers, and none the detailed landscape backgrounds that other artists were developing.  Many exist in several versions of varying quality, often with the elements other than the Virgin and Child different.  Many of these were produced by Botticelli or, especially, his workshop, and others apparently by unconnected artists.  When interest in Botticelli revived in the 19th century, it was initially largely in his Madonnas, which then began to be forged on a considerable scale.<ref>Ettlingers, 80; Lightbown, 82, 185\u2013186</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'' in the Uffizi (118 cm or 46.5 inches across, c. 1483), Mary is writing down the ''[[Magnificat]]'', a speech from the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleref2|Luke|1:46\u201355|4=1:46\u201355}}) where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] to her cousin [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], some months before the birth of Jesus.  She holds the baby Jesus, and is surrounded by wingless angels impossible to distinguish from fashionably-dressed Florentine youths.<ref>Ettlingers, 81\u201384</ref>\n\n==Portraits==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 074.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder]]'', 1474; the medal is an inserted [[gesso]] cast of a real medal.]] \nBotticelli painted a number of portraits, although not nearly as many as have been attributed to him.  There are a number of idealized portrait-like paintings of women which probably do not represent a specific person (several closely resemble the Venus in his ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'').<ref>Campbell, 6</ref> Traditional gossip links these to the famous beauty [[Simonetta Vespucci]], who died aged twenty-two in 1476, but this seems unlikely.<ref>Ettlingers, 164</ref> These figures represent a secular link to his ''Madonnas''.  \n\nWith one or two exceptions his small independent panel portraits show the sitter no further down the torso than about the bottom of the rib-cage.  Women are normally in profile, full or just a little turned, whereas men are normally a \"three-quarters\" pose, but never quite seen completely frontally.  Even when the head is facing more or less straight ahead, the lighting is used to create a difference between the sides of the face.  Backgrounds may be plain, or show an open window, usually with nothing but sky visible through it. A few have developed landscape backgrounds.  These characteristics were typical of Florentine portraits at the beginning of his career, but old-fashioned by his last years.<ref>Ettlingers, 171; Lightbown, 54\u201357</ref>  \n\nMany portraits exist in several versions, probably most mainly by the workshop; there is often uncertainty in their attribution.<ref>Ettlingers, 156</ref> Often the background changes between versions while the figure remains the same.  His male portraits have also often held dubious identifications, most often of various Medicis, for longer than the real evidence supports.<ref>Ettlingers, 156, 163\u2013164, 168\u2013172</ref> Lightbown attributes him only with about eight portraits of individuals, all but three from before about 1475.<ref>Lightbown, 54.  This appears to exclude the idealized females, and certainly the portraits included in larger works.</ref> \n\nBotticelli often slightly exaggerates aspects of the features to increase the likeness.<ref>Campbell, 12</ref> He also painted portraits in other works, as when he inserted a [[self-portrait]] and the Medici into his early ''Adoration of the Magi''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Adoration of the Magi by Botticelli |url=https://www.virtualuffizi.com/the-adoration-of-the-magi-by-botticelli%3A-an-artwork-full-of-innovation.html |website=Virtual Uffizi Gallery |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made.<ref>Ettlingers, 156\u2013164</ref> Large allegorical frescos from a villa show members of the [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni|Tornabuoni]] family together with gods and personifications; probably not all of these survive but ones with portraits of [[A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts|a young man with the Seven Liberal Arts]] and [[Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman|a young woman with Venus and the Three Graces]] are now in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Campbell, 56, 136\u2013136</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:YoungManBotticelli.jpg|Young Man, [[Pitti Palace]], perhaps 1470-73.\nFile:Alessandro_Botticelli_Portrait_of_a_Lady_(Smeralda_Brandini.jpg|''[[Portrait of a Lady Known as Smeralda Brandini]]'', 1470s, [[Pregnancy in art|shown as pregnant]].\nFile:Giuliano de' Medici by Sandro Botticelli.jpeg|''[[Giuliano de' Medici]]'', who was assassinated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]].

Botticelli's aquiline version influenced many later depictions.</ref> According to Vasari, he \"wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante\", which is also referred to dismissively in another story in the ''Life'',<ref>Vasari, 152, 154</ref> but no such text has survived.  \n\nBotticelli's attempt to design the illustrations for a printed book was unprecedented for a leading painter, and though it seems to have been something of a flop, this was a role for artists that had an important future.<ref>Landau, 35, 38</ref> Vasari wrote disapprovingly of the first printed Dante in 1481 with [[engraving]]s by the goldsmith [[Baccio Baldini]], engraved from drawings by Botticelli: \"being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and [[Divine Comedy illustrated by Botticelli|illustrated the Inferno]] which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstention from work led to serious disorders in his living.\"<ref>Vasari, 152, a different translation</ref> Vasari, who lived when [[printmaking]] had become far more important than in Botticelli's day, never takes it seriously, perhaps because his own paintings did not sell well in reproduction.  \n\n[[File:Botticelli Inferno XVIII.png|thumb|left|One of the few fully coloured pages of the [[Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli]], illustrating canto XVIII in the eighth circle of Hell.  Dante and Virgil descending through the ten chasms of the circle via a ridge.]]\nThe ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' consists of 100 cantos, and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three.  The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place.  This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book.  Unfortunately Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates.<ref>Lightbown, 89; Landau, 108; Dempsey</ref> Two religious engravings are also generally accepted to be after designs by Botticelli.<ref name=\"auto\">Lightbown, 302</ref>  \n\nBotticelli later began a luxury [[Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli|manuscript illustrated Dante]] on [[parchment]], most of which was taken only as far as the [[underdrawing]]s, and only a few pages are fully illuminated.  This manuscript has 93 surviving pages (32 x 47 cm), now divided between the [[Vatican Library]] (8 sheets) and Berlin (83), and represents the bulk of Botticelli's surviving drawings.<ref>Lightbown, 280; some are drawn on both sides of the sheet.</ref>  \n\nOnce again, the project was never completed, even at the drawing stage, but some of the early cantos appear to have been at least drawn but are now missing.  The pages that survive have always been greatly admired, and much discussed, as the project raises many questions.  The general consensus is that most of the drawings are late; the main scribe can be identified as Niccol\u00f2 Mangona, who worked in Florence between 1482 and 1503, whose work presumably preceded that of Dante.  Botticelli then appears to have worked on the drawings over a long period, as stylistic development can be seen, and matched to his paintings.  Although other patrons have been proposed (inevitably including Medicis, in particular the younger Lorenzo, or il Magnifico), some scholars think that Botticelli made the manuscript for himself.<ref>Dempsey; Lightbown, 280\u2013282, 290</ref>\n\nThere are hints that Botticelli may have worked on illustrations for printed [[pamphlet]]s by Savonarola, almost all destroyed after his fall.<ref>Landau, 95</ref>\n\n==The Medici==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Pallade e il centauro - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', c. 1482. [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]\nThe [[Medici family]] were effective rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled.  [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]] became the head of the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop.  He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting seems to come.  In general Lorenzo does not seem to have commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others,<ref>Hartt, 323</ref> although views on this differ.<ref>Lightbown, 11, 58; Dempsey</ref> A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo.<ref>Lightbown, 58</ref> \n\nAlthough the patrons of many works not for churches remain unclear, Botticelli seems to have been used more by Lorenzo il Magnifico's two young cousins, his younger brother [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]],<ref>Lightbown, 58\u201359</ref> and other families allied to the Medici.  Tommaso Soderini, a close ally of Lorenzo, obtained the commission for the figure of ''Fortitude'' of 1470 which is Botticelli's earliest securely dated painting, completing a series of the ''[[Seven Virtues]]'' left unfinished by [[Piero Pollaiuolo]].  Possibly they had been introduced by a Vespucci who had tutored Soderini's son.  Antonio Pucci, another Medici ally, probably commissioned the London ''Adoration of the Magi'', also around 1470.<ref>Lightbown, 42\u201350; Dempsey</ref>\n\nGiuliano de' Medici was assassinated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 (Lorenzo narrowly escaped, saved by his bank manager), and a portrait said to be Giuliano which survives in several versions may be posthumous, or with at least one version from not long before his death.<ref>Lightbown, 58\u201365, believes it is Giuliano, and the Washington version probably pre-dates his death; the Ettlingers, 168, are sceptical it is Giuliano at all.  The various museums with versions still support the identification.</ref> He is also a focus for theories that figures in the mythological paintings represent specific individuals from Florentine high society, usually paired with Simonetta Vespucci, who [[John Ruskin]] persuaded himself had posed nude for Botticelli.<ref>Ettlingers, 164; Clark, 372 note for p. 92 quote.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 021.jpg|thumb|''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|Calumny of Apelles]]'' (c. 1494\u201395). [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]\nAccording to Vasari, Botticelli became a follower of the deeply moralistic [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]], who preached in Florence from 1490 until his [[Burning at the stake|execution]] in 1498:<ref name=\"auto6\">Vasari, 152</ref>  \n\n<blockquote>Botticelli was a follower of Savonarola's, and this was why he gave up painting and then fell into considerable distress as he had no other source of income.  None the less, he remained an obstinate member of the sect, becoming one of the ''piagnoni'', the snivellers, as they were called then, and abandoning his work; so finally, as an old man, he found himself so poor that if Lorenzo de' Medici ... and then his friends and ... [others] had not come to his assistance, he would have almost died of hunger.<ref name=\"auto6\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe extent of Savonarola's influence on Botticelli remains uncertain; his brother Simone was more clearly a follower.<ref>Hartt, 335\u2013336; Davies, 105\u2013106; Ettlingers, 13\u201314</ref> The story, sometimes seen, that he had destroyed his own paintings on secular subjects in the notorious \"''[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]''\" is not told by Vasari.  Vasari's assertion that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola is not accepted by modern art historians.  [[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|''The Mystical Nativity'']], Botticelli's only painting to carry an actual date, if one cryptically expressed, comes from late 1500,<ref>Ettlingers, 14; Vasari, 152</ref> eighteen months after Savonarola died, and the development of his style can be traced through a number of late works, as discussed below.  \n[[File:Suicide lucretia.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'', c. 1500. [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]].]]\n\nIn late 1502, some four years after Savonarola's death, [[Isabella d'Este]] wanted a painting done in Florence.  Her agent Francesco Malatesta wrote to inform her that her first choice, Perugino, was away, Filippino Lippi had a full schedule for six months, but Botticelli was free to start at once, and ready to oblige.  She preferred to wait for Perugino's return.<ref name=\"auto\"/> This again casts serious doubt on Vasari's assertion, but equally he does not seem to have been in great demand.<ref>Ettlingers, 14; Legouix, 18</ref>  \n\nMany datings of works have a range up to 1505, though he did live a further five years.<ref>Legouix, 18; Dempsey</ref> But Botticelli apparently produced little work after 1501, or perhaps earlier, and his production had already reduced after about 1495.  This may be partly because of the time he devoted to the drawings for the manuscript Dante.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> In 1504 he was a member of the committee appointed to decide where [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' would be placed.<ref>Legouix, 18; Ettlingers, 203</ref>  \n\nBotticelli returned to subjects from antiquity in the 1490s, with a few smaller works on subjects from ancient history containing more figures and showing different scenes from each story, including moments of dramatic action. These are the ''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|Calumny of Apelles]]'' (c. 1494\u201395), a recreation of a lost [[allegory]] by the ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]], which he may have intended for his personal use,<ref>Lightbown, 230\u2013237; Legouix, 114;</ref> and the pair of ''[[The Story of Virginia (Botticelli)|The story of Virginia]]'' and ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'', which are probably from around 1500.<ref>Lightbown, 260\u2013269; Legouix, 82\u201383</ref>\n[[File:Boticelli - Mystische Geburt.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|[[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|''The Mystical Nativity'']] (c.&nbsp;1500\u201301) [[National Gallery, London]].]]\n\n''[[The Mystical Nativity]]'', a relatively small and very personal painting, perhaps for his own use, appears to be dated to the end of 1500.<ref>Davies, 103\u2013106</ref> It takes to an extreme the abandonment of consistent scale among the figures that had been a feature of Botticelli's religious paintings for some years, with the Holy Family much larger than the other figures, even those well in front of them in the picture space.<ref>Lightbown, 221\u2013223</ref> This may be seen as a partial reversion to Gothic conventions.  The [[iconography]] of the familiar [[Nativity of Jesus in art|subject of the Nativity]] is unique, with features including devils hiding in the rock below the scene, and must be highly personal.<ref>Lightbown, 248\u2013253; Dempsey; Ettlingers, 96\u2013103</ref>  \n\nAnother painting, known as the ''Mystic Crucifixion'' (now [[Fogg Art Museum]]), clearly relates to the state, and fate, of Florence, shown in the background behind Christ on the Cross, beside which an angel whips a [[marzocco]], the heraldic lion that is a symbol of the city. This can be connected more directly to the convulsions of the expulsion of the Medici, Savonarola's brief supremacy, and the French invasion.  Unfortunately it is very damaged, such that it may not be by Botticelli, while it is certainly in his style.<ref>Lightbown, 242\u2013247; Ettlingers, 103\u2013105.  Lightbown connects it more specifically to Savonarola than the Ettlingers.</ref>\n\nHis later work, especially as seen in the four panels with ''[[Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius]]'', witnessed a diminution of scale, expressively distorted figures, and a non-naturalistic use of colour reminiscent of the work of [[Fra Angelico]] nearly a century earlier.  Botticelli has been compared to the Venetian painter [[Carlo Crivelli]], some ten years older, whose later work also veers away from the imminent [[High Renaissance]] style, instead choosing to \"move into a distinctly Gothic idiom\".<ref>Legouix, 11\u201312; Dempsey</ref> Other scholars have seen premonitions of [[Mannerism]] in the simplified expressionist depiction of emotions in his works of the last years.<ref>Hartt, 334, 337</ref>  \n\nErnst Steinmann (d. 1934) detected in the later Madonna's a  \"deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's [[physiognomy]]\", which he attributed to Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating of some of these Madonnas.)<ref>Steinmann, Ernst, [https://archive.org/stream/botticelli00steiuoft#page/28/mode/2up ''Botticelli'', 26\u201328]</ref> More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though there is certainly a replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period.\n\nBotticelli continued to pay his dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a [[confraternity]] rather than the [[artist's guild]]) until at least October 1505;<ref>Lightbown, 303\u2013304</ref> the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this.  By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died \"ill and decrepit, at the age of seventy-eight\", after a period when he was \"unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Vasari, 154</ref> He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been something under seventy at the time.  He was buried with his family outside the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti Church]] in a spot the church has now built over.<ref>Lightbown, 305; Ettlingers, 15</ref> This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]''.<ref>Lightbown, 17</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nVasari mentions that Botticelli produced very fine drawings, which were sought out by artists after his death.<ref>Vasari, 155</ref> Apart from the Dante illustrations, only a small number of these survive, none of which can be connected with surviving paintings, or at least not their final compositions, although they appear to be preparatory drawings rather than independent works.  Some may be connected with the work in other media that we know Botticelli did.  Three [[vestment]]s survive with embroidered designs by him, and he developed a new technique for decorating banners for religious and secular processions, apparently in some kind of [[appliqu\u00e9]] technique.<ref>Lightbown, 296\u2013298: Ettlingers, 175\u2013178, who are more ready to connect studies to surviving paintings.</ref>\n\n==Workshop==\n[[File:Botticelli, madonna della melagrana 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna of the Pomegranate]]'' (''Madonna della Melagrana''), c.&nbsp;1487]]\nIn 1472 the records of the painter's guild record that Botticelli had only Filippino Lippi as an assistant, though another source records a twenty-eight-year old, who had trained with [[Neri di Bicci]].  By 1480 there were three, none of them subsequently of note.   Other names occur in the record, but only Lippi became a well-known master.<ref>Legouix, 8; Lightbown, 311, 314</ref> A considerable number of works, especially Madonnas, are attributed to Botticelli's workshop, or the master and his workshop, generally meaning that Botticelli did the underdrawing, while the assistants did the rest, or drawings by him were copied by the workshop.<ref>Lightbown, 314</ref>  \n\nBotticelli's linear style was relatively easy to imitate, making different contributions within one work hard to identify,<ref>Ettlingers, 79</ref> though the quality of the master's drawing makes works entirely by others mostly identifiable.  The attribution of many works remains debated, especially in terms of distinguishing the share of work between master and workshop.  Lightbown believed that \"the division between Botticelli's autograph works and the paintings from his workshop and circle is a fairly sharp one\", and that in only one major work on panel \"do we find important parts executed by assistants\";<ref>Lightbown, 312</ref> but others might disagree.\n\nThe National Gallery have an ''Adoration of the Kings'' of about 1470, which they describe as begun by Filippino Lippi but finished by Botticelli, noting how unusual it was for a master to take over a work begun by a pupil.<ref>[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-and-filippino-lippi-adoration-of-the-kings National Gallery page]; see Davies, 97 for a slightly different view, and Lightbown, 311 for a very different one.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Finances===\n\nAccording to Vasari's perhaps unreliable account, Botticelli \"earned a great deal of money, but wasted it all through carelessness and lack of management\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He continued to live in the family house all his life, also having his studio there.  On his father's death in 1482 it was inherited by his brother Giovanni, who had a large family. By the end of his life it was owned by his nephews.  From the 1490s he had a modest country villa and farm at Bellosguardo (now swallowed up by the city), which was leased with his brother Simone.<ref>Ettlingers, 12\u201314</ref>\n\n===Sexuality===\n\nBotticelli never married, and apparently expressed a strong dislike of the idea of marriage.  An anecdote records that his patron Tommaso Soderini, who died in 1485, suggested he marry, to which Botticelli replied that a few days before he had dreamed that he had married, woke up \"struck with grief\", and for the rest of the night walked the streets to avoid the dream resuming if he slept again.  The story concludes cryptically that Soderini understood \"that he was not fit ground for planting vines\".<ref>Lightbown, 44</ref>  \n\nThere has been over a century of speculation that Botticelli himself may actually have been homosexual. Many writers observed homo-eroticism in his portraits. The American art historian [[Bernard Berenson]], for example, detected what he believed to be latent homosexuality.<ref>Hudson</ref> In 1938, [[Jacques Mesnil]] discovered a summary of a charge in the Florentine Archives for November 16, 1502, which read simply \"Botticelli keeps a boy\", an accusation of [[sodomy]] (homosexuality). No prosecution was brought. The painter would then have been about fifty-eight. Mesnil dismissed it as a customary slander by which partisans and adversaries of [[Savonarola]] abused each other. Opinion remains divided on whether this is evidence of bisexuality or homosexuality.<ref>Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003</ref> Many have backed Mesnil.<ref>Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', Oxford University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|9780195069754}}; Lightbown, 302</ref> Art historian Scott Nethersole has suggested that a quarter of Florentine men were the subject of similar accusations, which \"seems to have been a standard way of getting at people\"<ref>Scott Nethersole ([[Courtauld Institute]]), quoted in Hudson</ref> but others have cautioned against hasty dismissal of the charge.<ref>Andre Chastel, ''Art et humanisme a Florence au temps de Laurent le Magnifique'', Presses Universitaires de France, 1959</ref> Mesnil nevertheless concluded \"woman was not the only object of his love\".<ref>Jacques Mesnil, ''Botticelli'', Paris, 1938</ref>\n\nThe Renaissance art historian, James Saslow, has noted that: \"His [Botticelli's] homo-erotic sensibility surfaces mainly in religious works where he imbued such nude young saints as Sebastian with the same androgynous grace and implicit physicality as Donatello's David\".<ref>James Saslow, ''Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in art and society, Yale University Pres, New Haven, 1986, p88</ref>\n\n==Later reputation==\n[[File:Vasari - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait, probably imagined, of Botticelli from Vasari's ''Life'']]\nAfter his death, Botticelli's reputation was eclipsed longer and more thoroughly than that of any other major European artist.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} His paintings remained in the churches and villas for which they had been created,<ref>''Primavera'' and ''The Birth of Venus'' remained in the Grand Ducal Medici villa of Castello until 1815.

Vasari's ''Life'' is relatively short and, especially in the first edition of 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers \"he is clearly ill at ease with Sandro and did not know how to fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from [[Cimabue]] to Michelangelo\".<ref>Ettlingers, 203</ref> Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with [[Francesco Botticini]], another Florentine painter of the day.  Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day.  Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation.  He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli.<ref>Lightbown, 16\u201317; Vasari, 147\u2013155</ref>  Vasari was born the year after Botticelli's death, but would have known many Florentines with memories of him. \n\nIn 1621 a picture-buying agent of [[Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] bought him a painting said to be a Botticelli out of historical interest \"as from the hand of an artist by whom Your Highness has nothing, and who was the master of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\".<ref>Lightbown, 14</ref> That mistake is perhaps understandable, as although Leonardo was only some six years younger than Botticelli, his style could seem to a Baroque judge to be a generation more advanced. \n\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna of the Book]]'', c.1480\u20133.]]\nThe ''Birth of Venus'' was displayed in the Uffizi from 1815, but is little mentioned in travellers' accounts of the gallery over the next two decades.  The [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin|Berlin gallery]] bought the ''[[#Bardi Altarpiece|Bardi Altarpiece]]'' in 1829, but the [[National Gallery, London]] only bought a Madonna (now regarded as by his workshop) in 1855.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> \n\nThe English collector [[William Young Ottley]] bought Botticelli's ''[[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|The Mystical Nativity]]'' in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799.

He belonged to the [[Florentine painting|Florentine School]] under the patronage of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], a movement that [[Giorgio Vasari]] would characterize less than a hundred years later in his ''Vita'' of Botticelli as a \"[[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]]\". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th  century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.\n\nAs well as the small number of mythological subjects which are his best known works today, he painted a wide range of religious subjects and also some portraits. He and his workshop were especially known for their ''Madonna and Child''s, many in the round [[tondo (art)|tondo]] shape.  Botticelli's best-known works are ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', both in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence.  He lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence, with probably his only significant time elsewhere the months he spent painting in [[Pisa]] in 1474 and the [[Sistine Chapel]] in Rome in 1481\u201382.<ref>Ettlingers, 199; Lightbown, 53 on the Pisa work, which does not survive</ref> \n\nOnly one of his paintings is dated, though others can be dated from other records with varying degrees of certainty, and the development of his style traced with confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, growing in mastery and reputation, and the 1480s were his most successful decade, when all his large mythological paintings were done, and many of his best Madonnas.  By the 1490s his style became more personal and to some extent mannered, and he could be seen as moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and a new generation of painters creating the [[High Renaissance]] style as Botticelli returned in some ways to the Gothic style.\n\nHe has been described as \"an outsider in the mainstream of Italian painting\", who had a limited interest in many of the developments most associated with [[Quattrocento]] painting, such as the realistic depiction of human anatomy, perspective, and landscape, and the use of direct borrowings from classical art.  His training enabled him to represent all these aspects of painting, without adopting or contributing to their development.<ref>Ettlingers, 199\u2013204, 203 quoted</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Via borgo ognissanti.JPG|thumb|Via Borgo Ognissanti in 2008, with the eponymous church halfway down on the right. Like the street, it has had a Baroque makeover since Botticelli's time.]]\nBotticelli was born in the city of [[Florence]] in a house in the street still called Via Borgo Ognissanti.  He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] (\"All Saints\") parish church.  His father was Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi, and Sandro was the youngest of his four children to survive into adulthood, all boys.<ref>Lightbown, 17\u201319</ref> The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458 so, allowing for arguments as to what these statements really meant, dates between 1444 and 1446 are given.<ref name=\"auto8\">Ettlingers, 7</ref>  \n\nHis father was a tanner until 1460, before joining his son Antonio in a new business as a beater-out of [[gold leaf]], which would have brought them into contact with artists.<ref>Lightbown, 19</ref> [[Giorgio Vasari]] reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a [[goldsmith]].<ref>He was still in school in February 1458 (Lightbown, 19). According to Vasari, 147, he was an able pupil, but easily grew restless, and was initially apprenticed as a goldsmith.</ref> He perhaps became an apprentice when he was about fourteen years old, which may indicate that he received a fuller education than many other Renaissance artists.  \n\nThe Ognissanti neighbourhood was mostly \"a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen,\"<ref name=\"auto1\">Lightbown, 18</ref> but there were some rich families, notably the very rich Rucellai, bankers and wool-merchants, headed by [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai]], whose [[Palazzo Rucellai]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]], a landmark in [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], was being built between about 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years.  By 1458, Botticelli's family had moved to the same street as this, and were renting their house from another Rucellai, and there were other dealings involving the two families.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1464, his father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro returned to live in from 1470 (if not before) and where he remained for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"auto9\">Lightbown, 18\u201319</ref> He both lived and had his workshop in the house, by now a rather unusual practice, despite his brother Giovanni and his family also being in residence (and later another brother, Simone).<ref>Ettlingers, 12</ref> Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including [[Amerigo Vespucci]], born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named.  The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The name Botticelli, meaning \"little barrel\", came from his brother Giovanni's nickname of \"Botticello\", \"apparently from an unfortunate resemblance\".  By 1470 a document referred to the painter as \"Sandro Mariano Botticelli\", and it became his customary surname.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> \n[[File:Botticelli 04 Louvre.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist'', c. 1470\u20131475, [[Louvre]]]]\n\n==Career before Rome==\nFrom around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to [[Filippo Lippi|Fra Filippo Lippi]], one of the top Florentine painters of the day, and one often patronized by the Medicis.  He was rather conservative in many respects, but gave Botticelli a solid training in the Florentine style and technique of the day, in panel painting, [[fresco]], and drawing.  Botticelli's paintings avoided technical short-cuts throughout his life, and when well treated they have survived in good condition for their age.   Elements in style and compositions that are reminiscent of Lippi also continue to appear throughout his career.<ref>Lightbown, 20\u201326</ref> For this period Lippi was in fact based in [[Prato]], just outside Florence, painting what is now [[Prato Cathedral]], and it is there that Botticelli was trained.  He had probably left Lippi by April 1467, when the master went to work in [[Spoleto]].<ref>Lightbown, 22, 25</ref>  \n\nIn the past there was speculation that he had also had a period in a more progressive workshop, and both that of the [[Pollaiuolo brothers]] and [[Verrochio]] have been suggested, based on some undoubted influence these had on Botticelli's style.  Current thinking is that no actual period in a different workshop is needed to account for this.<ref>Lightbown, 26; but see Hartt, 324, saying \"Botticelli was active in the shop of Verrocchio\".</ref>  \n\nLippi died in 1469 and by 1470 at the latest, but probably a year or two earlier, Botticelli had his own workshop, which by 1472 included the young [[Filippino Lippi]], son of his master.<ref>Dempsey, Hartt, 324; Legouix, 8</ref> In June of that year he was commissioned by the judges of commercial cases to paint two panels from a set of the [[Seven Virtues]] for their court;<ref>Lightbown, 52; they were the ''Sei della Mercanzia'', a tribunal of six judges, chosen by the main [[Guilds of Florence]].</ref> for some reason, only one, ''Fortitude'' (now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]]) was finished.  Botticelli both matched his style and composition to the other panels by [[Piero del Pollaiuolo]], and tried to outshine him \"with fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention.\"<ref>Lightbown, 46 (quoted); Ettlingers, 19\u201322</ref> \n\nThere is often uncertainty in distinguishing between the contributions of Botticelli, the Lippis, and other pupils and imitators of Botticelli.  Especially in smaller works such as Madonnas, all the leading painters were copied or imitated by their own workshops and a host of unidentified lesser artists.<ref>Ettlingers, 17\u201318</ref> Influenced also by the monumentality of [[Masaccio]]'s painting, it was from Lippi that Botticelli learned a more intimate and detailed manner.  Even at this early date, his work was characterized by a conception of the figure as if seen in low relief, drawn with clear contours, and minimizing strong contrasts of light and shadow which would indicate fully modelled forms. Lippi's synthesis of the new control of three-dimensional forms, tender expressiveness in face and gesture, and decorative details inherited from the late Gothic style were the strongest influences on Botticelli. A different influence was the new sculptural monumentality of the Pollaiuolo brothers.<ref>Ettlingers, 18</ref>\n\n===Key early paintings===\nA large ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' altarpiece of about 1470\u201372 is in the Uffizi. It is not in good condition, but shows Botticelli had mastered the posing of a group of eight figures \"with a skillful semblance of easy naturalness in a closed architectural setting\".<ref>Lightbown, 50</ref> One work that can be firmly dated is the narrow  ''[[St. Sebastian (Botticelli)|Saint Sebastian]]'' made for a pier in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] and dedicated in January 1474; it is now in Berlin.<ref>Lightbown, 50\u201351</ref> This was painted at the same time as the Pollaiuolo brothers' much larger altarpiece of the same saint, a showpiece of anatomical poses, with the saint shown in great pain.<ref>[[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 003 cropframe.JPG|the Pollaiuolo brothers' painting, now National Gallery, London]]</ref> Though very similar in pose, no doubt after Botticelli had seen the other painting, Botticelli's Sebastian seems calm and poised, following the legend that the arrows did not kill Sebastian, whose wounds were miraculously healed.  The almost nude body is very carefully drawn; usually Botticelli was not greatly concerned with anatomical precision, and he painted relatively few nudes, though some are among his most famous works.  The delicate winter landscape, reflecting the traditional date of the saint's martyrdom and feast-day in January, is also one of Botticelli's more impressive efforts.<ref>Lightbown, 51\u201352; Ettlingers, 22\u201323</ref>     \n\nAt the start of 1474 Botticelli was asked by the authorities in Pisa to join the work frescoing the [[Camposanto]], a huge and prestigious project mostly being done by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], who spent nearly twenty years on it.  Various payments up to September are recorded, but no work survives, and it seems that whatever Botticelli started was not finished.  Whatever the outcome, that Botticelli was approached from outside Florence demonstrates a growing reputation.<ref>Lightbown, 52</ref>  \n[[File:Zanobi-Altar.jpg|thumb|''[[Adoration of the Magi (Botticelli, 1475)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', 1475, 111 cm \u00d7 134&nbsp;cm (44 in \u00d7 53 in)]]\n\nThe ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Botticelli, 1475)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for [[Santa Maria Novella]] (c. 1475\u201376, now in the [[Uffizi]], and the first of 8 ''Adorations''),<ref>Hartt, 324</ref> was singled out for praise by Vasari, and was in a much-visited church, so spreading his reputation.  It can be thought of as marking the climax of Botticelli's early style.  Despite being commissioned by a money-changer, or perhaps money-lender, not otherwise known as an ally of the Medici, it contains the portraits of [[Cosimo de Medici]], his sons [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]] and [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni]] (all these by now dead), and his grandsons [[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo]] and [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]].  There are also portraits of the donor and, in the view of most, Botticelli himself, standing at the front on the right.  The painting was celebrated for the variety of the angles from which the faces are painted, and of their expressions.<ref>Lightbown, 65\u201369; Vasari, 150\u2013152; Hartt, 324\u2013325</ref>\n\nA large [[fresco]] for the customs house of Florence, that is now lost, depicted the execution by [[hanging]] of the leaders of the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 against the Medici.  It was a Florentine custom to humiliate traitors in this way, by the so-called \"''[[pittura infamante]]''\".<ref>Ettlingers, 10</ref> This was Botticelli's first major fresco commission (apart from the abortive Pisa excursion), and may have led to his summons to Rome.  The figure of [[Francesco Salviati (bishop)|Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa]] was removed in 1479, after protests from the Pope, and the rest were destroyed after the expulsion of the Medici and return of the [[Pazzi family]] in 1494.<ref>Hartt, 325\u2013326; Ettlingers, 10; Dempsey</ref> Another lost work was a [[tondo (art)|tondo]] of the Madonna ordered by a Florentine banker in Rome to present to Cardinal [[Francesco Gonzaga (1444\u20131483)|Francesco Gonzaga]]; this perhaps spread awareness of his work to Rome.  A fresco in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], headquarters of the Florentine state, was lost in the next century when Vasari remodelled the building.<ref>Lightbown, 70</ref> \n\nIn 1480 the Vespucci family commissioned a fresco figure of ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine]]'' for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's.  Someone else, probably the order running the church,<ref>Lightbown, 77</ref> commissioned [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] to do a facing ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|Saint Jerome]]''; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects.  As in other cases, such direct competition \"was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers\", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lighbown.<ref>Lightbown, 73\u201378, 74 quoted</ref> The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known.  Most of the \"text\" is scribbles, but one line reads: \"Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato\", probably dialogue overheard from  the [[Humiliati|Uumiliati]], the order who ran the church.

This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel; most of the frescos remain, but are now greatly overshadowed and disrupted by [[Michelangelo]]'s work of the next century, to make room for which some of them were destroyed.<ref>Shearman, 38\u201342, 47; Lightbown, 90\u201392; Hartt, 326</ref> The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy.  After Sixtus was implicated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] hostilities had escalated into [[excommunication]] for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small \"Pazzi War\".<ref>Shearman, 47; Hartt, 326; Martines, Chapter 10 for the hostilities.</ref>  \n\nThe iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] and the ''Life of [[Moses]]'', together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy.  Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the [[Temptations of Christ (Botticelli)|''Temptations of Christ'']], ''[[Youth of Moses]]'' and ''[[Punishment of the Sons of Corah]]'' (or various other titles),<ref>Shearman, 70\u201375; Hartt, 326\u2013327</ref> as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the [[lunette]]s above, where Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] now is.  He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed.<ref>Shearman, 47</ref> Each painter bought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.<ref>Hartt, 327; Shearman, 47</ref>\n[[File:Botticcelli, Sandro - The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron - 1481-82.jpg|thumb|''[[Punishment of the Sons of Corah]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\n\nVasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that [[Pietro Perugino]], the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was.<ref>Hartt, 326\u2013327; Lightbown, 92\u201394, thinks no one was, but that Botticelli set the style for the figures of the popes.</ref> The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities.  The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene.  Allowing for the painted [[pilaster]]s that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes.<ref>Lightbown, 90\u201392, 97\u201399, 105\u2013106; Hartt, 327; Shearman, 47, 50\u201375</ref>  \n\nBotticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent [[triptych]]-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents.<ref>Hartt, 327</ref> In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the ''Youth of Moses''.<ref>Lightbown, 99\u2013105</ref> The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored.<ref>Lightbown, 96\u201397</ref>    \n\nThe ''Punishment of the Sons of Corah'' contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work.  This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]''.<ref>Lightbown, 106\u2013108; Ettlingers, 202</ref> If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an ''Adoration of the Magi'', now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.<ref>Lightbown, 111\u2013113</ref> In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedalletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded.  He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482.<ref>Lightbown, 90, 94</ref>\n\n==Mythological subjects of the 1480s==\n[[File:Botticelli-primavera.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' (c. 1482), icon of the springtime renewal of the Florentine Renaissance.

[[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]\nThe masterpieces ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' (c. 1482) and ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the [[Uffizi]].  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.  Together with the smaller and less celebrated [[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|''Venus and Mars'']] and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', they have been endlessly analysed by [[art historian]]s, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]], and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures.<ref>Covered at length in: Lightbown, Ch. 7 & 8; Wind, Ch. V, VII and VIII; Ettlingers, Ch. 3; Dempsey; Hartt, 329\u2013334</ref> \n\nThough all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity.  All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary [[Renaissance humanist]]s. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying \"grace\" and by [[John Ruskin]] as possessing linear rhythm.  The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colors.<ref name=Lightbown/>\n\nThe ''Primavera'' and the ''Birth'' were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the [[Villa di Castello]], owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/5allegor/20pallas.html|title=Web Gallery of Art, searchable fine arts image database|website=www.wga.hu}}</ref> it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the ''Primavera'' was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and ''The Birth of Venus'' was commissioned by someone else for a different site.<ref>Lightbown, 122\u2013123; 152\u2013153; Smith, Webster, \"On the Original Location of the Primavera\", ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', vol. 57, no. 1, 1975, pp. 31\u201340.

A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'' in the National Gallery, London.  This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a ''[[spalliera]]'', a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wood panelling.  The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms.  Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant [[satyr]]s play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a [[conch shell]] in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber.<ref>Lightbown, 164\u2013168; Dempsey; Ettlingers, 138\u2013141, with a later date.</ref>\n\nThree of these four large mythologies feature [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], a central figure in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]], which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity.  The fourth, ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'' is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress. The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason.<ref>Lightbown, 148\u2013152; Legouix, 113</ref>\n\n==Religious paintings after Rome==\nBotticelli returned from Rome in 1482 with a reputation considerably enhanced by his work there.  As with his secular paintings, many religious commissions are larger and no doubt more expensive than before.<ref>Lightbown, 180</ref> Altogether more datable works by Botticelli come from the 1480s than any other decade,<ref name=\"auto3\">Dempsey</ref> and most of these are religious.  By the mid-1480s, many leading Florentine artists had left the city, some never to return.  The rising star [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who scoffed at Botticelli's landscapes,<ref>Hartt, 329. According to Leonardo, Botticelli anticipated the method of some 18th century [[watercolour]]ists by claiming that a landscape could be begun by throwing a sponge loaded with paint at the panel.</ref> left in 1481 for [[Milan]], the Pollaiolo brothers in 1484 for Rome, and [[Andrea Verrochio]] in 1485 for [[Venice]].<ref name=\"auto4\">Ettlingers, 11</ref>  \n\nThe remaining leaders of Florentine painting, Botticelli, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Filippino Lippi]], worked on a major fresco cycle with [[Perugino]], for [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]]'s villa at Spedalletto near [[Volterra]].<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Botticelli painted many Madonnas, covered in a section below, and [[altarpiece]]s and frescos in Florentine churches. In 1491 he served on a committee to decide upon a fa\u00e7ade for the [[Cathedral of Florence]], receiving the next year a small payment for a design for a scheme, eventually abortive, to put [[mosaic]]s on some interior roof vaults in the cathedral.<ref>Lightbown, 211\u2013213</ref>\n\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Madonna with Saints - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The ''Bardi Altarpiece'', 1484\u201385, 185 x 180 cm]]\n===''Bardi Altarpiece''===\nThe first major church commission after Rome was the '''''Bardi Altarpiece''''', finished and framed by February 1485,<ref>Lightbown, 182</ref> and now in Berlin. The frame was by no less a figure than [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], who was just becoming Lorenzo il Magnifico's favourite architect.  An enthroned Madonna and (rather large) Child sit on an elaborately-carved raised stone bench in a garden, with plants and flowers behind them closing off all but small patches of sky, to give a version of the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' or closed garden, a very traditional setting for the Virgin Mary. Saints [[John the Baptist]] and an unusually elderly [[John the Evangelist]] stand in the foreground. Small and inconspicuous [[banderole]]s or ribbons carrying biblical verses elucidate the rather complex theological meaning of the work, for which Botticelli must have had a clerical advisor, but do not intrude on a simpler appreciation of the painting and its lovingly detailed rendering, which Vasari praised.<ref>Lightbown, 180\u2013185; Ettlingers, 72\u201374</ref> It is somewhat typical of Botticelli's relaxed approach to strict perspective that the top ledge of the bench is seen from above, but the vases with lilies on it from below.<ref>Legouix, 38</ref>\n\nThe donor, from the leading [[Bardi family]], had returned to Florence from over twenty years as a banker and wool merchant in London, where he was known as \"John de Barde\",<ref>Lightbown, 180; Ettlingers, 73</ref> and aspects of the painting may reflect north European and even English art and popular devotional trends.<ref>Lightbown, 184</ref> There may have been other panels in the altarpiece, which are now missing.<ref>Ettlingers, 73</ref>\n\n[[File:Botticelli, pala di san barnaba 01.jpg|thumb|''San Barnaba Altarpiece'', c. 1487, Uffizi, 268 x 280 cm]]\n===''San Barnaba Altarpiece''===\nA larger and more crowded altarpiece is the '''''San Barnaba Altarpiece''''' of about 1487, now in the Uffizi, where elements of Botticelli's emotional late style begin to appear.  Here the setting is a palatial heavenly interior in the latest style, showing Botticelli taking a new degree of interest in architecture, possibly influenced by Sangallo. The Virgin and Child are raised high on a throne, at the same level as four angels carrying the [[Instruments of the Passion]].  Six saints stand in line below the throne.  Several figures have rather large heads, and the infant Jesus is again very large.  While the faces of the Virgin, child and angels have the linear beauty of his tondos, the saints are given varied and intense expressions.  Four small and rather simple ''[[predella]]'' panels survive; there were probably originally seven.<ref>Lightbown, 187\u2013190; Legouix, 31, 42</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nWith the phase of painting large secular works probably over by the late 1480s, Botticelli painted several altarpieces, and this appears to have been a peak period for his workshop's production of Madonnas. Botticelli's largest altarpiece, the ''San Marco Altarpiece'' (378 x 258 cm, Uffizi), is the only one to remain with its full ''predella'', of five panels.  In the air above four saints, the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' is taking place in a heavenly zone of gold and bright colours that recall his earlier works, with encircling angels dancing and throwing flowers.<ref>Lightbown, 198\u2013200; Legouix, 42\u201344</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the ''[[Cestello Annunciation]]'' (1489\u201390, Uffizi) forms a natural grouping with other late paintings, especially two of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] that share its sombre background colouring, and the rather exaggerated expressiveness of the bending poses of the figures.  It does have an unusually detailed landscape, still in dark colours, seen through the window, which seems to draw on north European models, perhaps from prints.<ref>Lightbown, 194\u2013198; Legouix, 103</ref>  \n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 016.jpg|thumb|''[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli)|Lamentation of Christ]]'', early 1490s, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.]]\n\nOf the two ''Lamentations'', [[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Milan)|one]] is in an unusual vertical format, because, like his 1474 ''Saint Sebastian'', it was painted for the side of a pillar in the Church of [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence]]; it is now in Milan.  [[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Munich)|The other, horizontal, one]] was painted for a chapel on the corner of Botticelli's street; it is now in Munich.  In both the crowded, intertwined figures around the dead Christ take up nearly all the picture space, with only bare rock behind.  The [[Swoon of the Virgin|Virgin has swooned]], and the other figures form a scrum to support her and Christ.<ref>Lightbown, 207\u2013209; Legouix, 107, 109</ref> The Munich painting has three less involved saints with attributes (somewhat oddly including [[Saint Peter]], usually regarded as in [[Jerusalem]] on the day, but not present at this scene), and gives the figures (except Christ) flat halos shown in perspective, which from now on Botticelli often uses.  Both probably date from 1490 to 1495.<ref>Lightbown dates the Munich picture to 1490\u201392, and the Milan one to c. 1495</ref>\n\nEarly records mentioned, without describing it, an altarpiece by Botticelli for the Convertite, an institution for ex-prostitutes, and various surviving unprovenanced works were proposed as candidates. It is now generally accepted that a painting in the [[Courtauld Gallery]] in London is the ''[[Pala delle Convertite]]'', dating to about 1491\u201393.  Its subject, unusual for an altarpiece, is the [[Holy Trinity]], with Christ on the cross, supported from behind by God the Father.  Angels surround the Trinity, which is flanked by two saints, with [[Book of Tobit|Tobias and the Angel]] on a far smaller scale right in the foreground.  This was probably a [[votive offering|votive]] addition, perhaps requested by the original donor.  The four predella scenes, showing the life of [[Mary Magdalen]], then taken as a reformed prostitute herself, are in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].<ref>Lightbown, 202\u2013207</ref> \n\nAfter about 1493 or 1495 Botticelli seems to have painted no more large religious paintings, though production of Madonnas probably continued. The smaller narrative religious scenes of the last years are covered below.\n  \n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Botticelli, incoronazione della vergine.jpg|''San Marco Altarpiece'', c. 1490-93, 378 x 258 cm, Uffizi\nFile:Botticelli, annunciazione di cestello 02.jpg|''[[Cestello Annunciation]]'', 1489-90, 150 x 156 cm, Uffizi\nFile:Sandro Botticelli 015.jpg|[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Milan)|''Lamentation over the Dead Christ'']], Milan\nFile:Botticelli Trinity.jpg|''[[Pala delle Convertite]]'', c. 1491-93, [[Courtauld Gallery]], London \n</gallery>\n\n==Madonnas, and tondos==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Madonna del Magnificat - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', c. 1483]]\nPaintings of the [[Madonna and Child]], that is, the [[Virgin Mary]] and infant [[Jesus]], were enormously popular in 15th-century Italy in a range of sizes and formats, from large altarpieces of the ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' type to small paintings for the home.  They also often hung in offices, public buildings, shops and clerical institutions. These smaller paintings were a steady source of income for painters at all levels of quality, and many were probably produced for stock, without a specific commission.<ref name=\"auto7\">Lightbown, 82</ref> \n\nBotticelli painted Madonnas from the start of his career until at least the 1490s. He was one of the first painters to use the round [[tondo (art)|tondo]] format, with the painted area typically some 115 to 145 cm across (about four to five feet).  This format was more associated with paintings for palaces than churches, though they were large enough to be hung in churches, and some were later donated to them.<ref>Lightbown, 47</ref> Several Madonnas use this format, usually with a seated Virgin shown down to the knees, and though rectangular pictures of the Madonna outnumber them, Madonnas in tondo form are especially associated with Botticelli.  He used the tondo format for other subjects, such as an early ''Adoration of the Magi'' in London,<ref>Lightbown, 47\u201350</ref> and was apparently more likely to paint a tondo Madonna himself, usually leaving rectangular ones to his workshop.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\nBotticelli's Virgins are always beautiful, in the same idealized way as his mythological figures, and often richly dressed in contemporary style.  Although [[Savonarola]]'s main strictures were against secular art, he also complained of the paintings in Florentine churches that \"You have made the Virgin appear dressed as a whore\",<ref name=\"auto3\"/> which may have had an effect on Botticelli's style.  They are often accompanied by equally beautiful angels, or an infant Saint [[John the Baptist]] (the patron saint of Florence).  Some feature flowers, and none the detailed landscape backgrounds that other artists were developing.  Many exist in several versions of varying quality, often with the elements other than the Virgin and Child different.  Many of these were produced by Botticelli or, especially, his workshop, and others apparently by unconnected artists.  When interest in Botticelli revived in the 19th century, it was initially largely in his Madonnas, which then began to be forged on a considerable scale.<ref>Ettlingers, 80; Lightbown, 82, 185\u2013186</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'' in the Uffizi (118 cm or 46.5 inches across, c. 1483), Mary is writing down the ''[[Magnificat]]'', a speech from the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleref2|Luke|1:46\u201355|4=1:46\u201355}}) where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] to her cousin [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], some months before the birth of Jesus.  She holds the baby Jesus, and is surrounded by wingless angels impossible to distinguish from fashionably-dressed Florentine youths.<ref>Ettlingers, 81\u201384</ref>\n\n==Portraits==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 074.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder]]'', 1474; the medal is an inserted [[gesso]] cast of a real medal.]] \nBotticelli painted a number of portraits, although not nearly as many as have been attributed to him.  There are a number of idealized portrait-like paintings of women which probably do not represent a specific person (several closely resemble the Venus in his ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'').<ref>Campbell, 6</ref> Traditional gossip links these to the famous beauty [[Simonetta Vespucci]], who died aged twenty-two in 1476, but this seems unlikely.<ref>Ettlingers, 164</ref> These figures represent a secular link to his ''Madonnas''.  \n\nWith one or two exceptions his small independent panel portraits show the sitter no further down the torso than about the bottom of the rib-cage.  Women are normally in profile, full or just a little turned, whereas men are normally a \"three-quarters\" pose, but never quite seen completely frontally.  Even when the head is facing more or less straight ahead, the lighting is used to create a difference between the sides of the face.  Backgrounds may be plain, or show an open window, usually with nothing but sky visible through it. A few have developed landscape backgrounds.  These characteristics were typical of Florentine portraits at the beginning of his career, but old-fashioned by his last years.<ref>Ettlingers, 171; Lightbown, 54\u201357</ref>  \n\nMany portraits exist in several versions, probably most mainly by the workshop; there is often uncertainty in their attribution.<ref>Ettlingers, 156</ref> Often the background changes between versions while the figure remains the same.  His male portraits have also often held dubious identifications, most often of various Medicis, for longer than the real evidence supports.<ref>Ettlingers, 156, 163\u2013164, 168\u2013172</ref> Lightbown attributes him only with about eight portraits of individuals, all but three from before about 1475.<ref>Lightbown, 54.  This appears to exclude the idealized females, and certainly the portraits included in larger works.</ref> \n\nBotticelli often slightly exaggerates aspects of the features to increase the likeness.<ref>Campbell, 12</ref> He also painted portraits in other works, as when he inserted a [[self-portrait]] and the Medici into his early ''Adoration of the Magi''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Adoration of the Magi by Botticelli |url=https://www.virtualuffizi.com/the-adoration-of-the-magi-by-botticelli%3A-an-artwork-full-of-innovation.html |website=Virtual Uffizi Gallery |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made.<ref>Ettlingers, 156\u2013164</ref> Large allegorical frescos from a villa show members of the [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni|Tornabuoni]] family together with gods and personifications; probably not all of these survive but ones with portraits of [[A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts|a young man with the Seven Liberal Arts]] and [[Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman|a young woman with Venus and the Three Graces]] are now in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Campbell, 56, 136\u2013136</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:YoungManBotticelli.jpg|Young Man, [[Pitti Palace]], perhaps 1470-73.\nFile:Alessandro_Botticelli_Portrait_of_a_Lady_(Smeralda_Brandini.jpg|''[[Portrait of a Lady Known as Smeralda Brandini]]'', 1470s, [[Pregnancy in art|shown as pregnant]].\nFile:Giuliano de' Medici by Sandro Botticelli.jpeg|''[[Giuliano de' Medici]]'', who was assassinated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]].

Dante and Virgil descending through the ten chasms of the circle via a ridge.]]\nThe ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' consists of 100 cantos, and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three.  The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place.  This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book.  Unfortunately Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates.<ref>Lightbown, 89; Landau, 108; Dempsey</ref> Two religious engravings are also generally accepted to be after designs by Botticelli.<ref name=\"auto\">Lightbown, 302</ref>  \n\nBotticelli later began a luxury [[Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli|manuscript illustrated Dante]] on [[parchment]], most of which was taken only as far as the [[underdrawing]]s, and only a few pages are fully illuminated.  This manuscript has 93 surviving pages (32 x 47 cm), now divided between the [[Vatican Library]] (8 sheets) and Berlin (83), and represents the bulk of Botticelli's surviving drawings.<ref>Lightbown, 280; some are drawn on both sides of the sheet.</ref>  \n\nOnce again, the project was never completed, even at the drawing stage, but some of the early cantos appear to have been at least drawn but are now missing.  The pages that survive have always been greatly admired, and much discussed, as the project raises many questions.  The general consensus is that most of the drawings are late; the main scribe can be identified as Niccol\u00f2 Mangona, who worked in Florence between 1482 and 1503, whose work presumably preceded that of Dante.  Botticelli then appears to have worked on the drawings over a long period, as stylistic development can be seen, and matched to his paintings.  Although other patrons have been proposed (inevitably including Medicis, in particular the younger Lorenzo, or il Magnifico), some scholars think that Botticelli made the manuscript for himself.<ref>Dempsey; Lightbown, 280\u2013282, 290</ref>\n\nThere are hints that Botticelli may have worked on illustrations for printed [[pamphlet]]s by Savonarola, almost all destroyed after his fall.<ref>Landau, 95</ref>\n\n==The Medici==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Pallade e il centauro - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', c. 1482. [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]\nThe [[Medici family]] were effective rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled.  [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]] became the head of the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop.  He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting seems to come.  In general Lorenzo does not seem to have commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others,<ref>Hartt, 323</ref> although views on this differ.<ref>Lightbown, 11, 58; Dempsey</ref> A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo.<ref>Lightbown, 58</ref> \n\nAlthough the patrons of many works not for churches remain unclear, Botticelli seems to have been used more by Lorenzo il Magnifico's two young cousins, his younger brother [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]],<ref>Lightbown, 58\u201359</ref> and other families allied to the Medici.  Tommaso Soderini, a close ally of Lorenzo, obtained the commission for the figure of ''Fortitude'' of 1470 which is Botticelli's earliest securely dated painting, completing a series of the ''[[Seven Virtues]]'' left unfinished by [[Piero Pollaiuolo]].  Possibly they had been introduced by a Vespucci who had tutored Soderini's son.  Antonio Pucci, another Medici ally, probably commissioned the London ''Adoration of the Magi'', also around 1470.<ref>Lightbown, 42\u201350; Dempsey</ref>\n\nGiuliano de' Medici was assassinated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 (Lorenzo narrowly escaped, saved by his bank manager), and a portrait said to be Giuliano which survives in several versions may be posthumous, or with at least one version from not long before his death.<ref>Lightbown, 58\u201365, believes it is Giuliano, and the Washington version probably pre-dates his death; the Ettlingers, 168, are sceptical it is Giuliano at all.  The various museums with versions still support the identification.</ref> He is also a focus for theories that figures in the mythological paintings represent specific individuals from Florentine high society, usually paired with Simonetta Vespucci, who [[John Ruskin]] persuaded himself had posed nude for Botticelli.<ref>Ettlingers, 164; Clark, 372 note for p. 92 quote.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 021.jpg|thumb|''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|Calumny of Apelles]]'' (c. 1494\u201395). [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]\nAccording to Vasari, Botticelli became a follower of the deeply moralistic [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]], who preached in Florence from 1490 until his [[Burning at the stake|execution]] in 1498:<ref name=\"auto6\">Vasari, 152</ref>  \n\n<blockquote>Botticelli was a follower of Savonarola's, and this was why he gave up painting and then fell into considerable distress as he had no other source of income.  None the less, he remained an obstinate member of the sect, becoming one of the ''piagnoni'', the snivellers, as they were called then, and abandoning his work; so finally, as an old man, he found himself so poor that if Lorenzo de' Medici ... and then his friends and ... [others] had not come to his assistance, he would have almost died of hunger.<ref name=\"auto6\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe extent of Savonarola's influence on Botticelli remains uncertain; his brother Simone was more clearly a follower.<ref>Hartt, 335\u2013336; Davies, 105\u2013106; Ettlingers, 13\u201314</ref> The story, sometimes seen, that he had destroyed his own paintings on secular subjects in the notorious \"''[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]''\" is not told by Vasari.  Vasari's assertion that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola is not accepted by modern art historians.  [[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|''The Mystical Nativity'']], Botticelli's only painting to carry an actual date, if one cryptically expressed, comes from late 1500,<ref>Ettlingers, 14; Vasari, 152</ref> eighteen months after Savonarola died, and the development of his style can be traced through a number of late works, as discussed below.  \n[[File:Suicide lucretia.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'', c. 1500. [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]].]]\n\nIn late 1502, some four years after Savonarola's death, [[Isabella d'Este]] wanted a painting done in Florence.  Her agent Francesco Malatesta wrote to inform her that her first choice, Perugino, was away, Filippino Lippi had a full schedule for six months, but Botticelli was free to start at once, and ready to oblige.  She preferred to wait for Perugino's return.<ref name=\"auto\"/> This again casts serious doubt on Vasari's assertion, but equally he does not seem to have been in great demand.<ref>Ettlingers, 14; Legouix, 18</ref>  \n\nMany datings of works have a range up to 1505, though he did live a further five years.<ref>Legouix, 18; Dempsey</ref> But Botticelli apparently produced little work after 1501, or perhaps earlier, and his production had already reduced after about 1495.  This may be partly because of the time he devoted to the drawings for the manuscript Dante.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> In 1504 he was a member of the committee appointed to decide where [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' would be placed.<ref>Legouix, 18; Ettlingers, 203</ref>  \n\nBotticelli returned to subjects from antiquity in the 1490s, with a few smaller works on subjects from ancient history containing more figures and showing different scenes from each story, including moments of dramatic action. These are the ''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|Calumny of Apelles]]'' (c. 1494\u201395), a recreation of a lost [[allegory]] by the ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]], which he may have intended for his personal use,<ref>Lightbown, 230\u2013237; Legouix, 114;</ref> and the pair of ''[[The Story of Virginia (Botticelli)|The story of Virginia]]'' and ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'', which are probably from around 1500.<ref>Lightbown, 260\u2013269; Legouix, 82\u201383</ref>\n[[File:Boticelli - Mystische Geburt.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|[[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|''The Mystical Nativity'']] (c.&nbsp;1500\u201301) [[National Gallery, London]].]]\n\n''[[The Mystical Nativity]]'', a relatively small and very personal painting, perhaps for his own use, appears to be dated to the end of 1500.<ref>Davies, 103\u2013106</ref> It takes to an extreme the abandonment of consistent scale among the figures that had been a feature of Botticelli's religious paintings for some years, with the Holy Family much larger than the other figures, even those well in front of them in the picture space.<ref>Lightbown, 221\u2013223</ref> This may be seen as a partial reversion to Gothic conventions.  The [[iconography]] of the familiar [[Nativity of Jesus in art|subject of the Nativity]] is unique, with features including devils hiding in the rock below the scene, and must be highly personal.<ref>Lightbown, 248\u2013253; Dempsey; Ettlingers, 96\u2013103</ref>  \n\nAnother painting, known as the ''Mystic Crucifixion'' (now [[Fogg Art Museum]]), clearly relates to the state, and fate, of Florence, shown in the background behind Christ on the Cross, beside which an angel whips a [[marzocco]], the heraldic lion that is a symbol of the city. This can be connected more directly to the convulsions of the expulsion of the Medici, Savonarola's brief supremacy, and the French invasion.  Unfortunately it is very damaged, such that it may not be by Botticelli, while it is certainly in his style.<ref>Lightbown, 242\u2013247; Ettlingers, 103\u2013105.  Lightbown connects it more specifically to Savonarola than the Ettlingers.</ref>\n\nHis later work, especially as seen in the four panels with ''[[Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius]]'', witnessed a diminution of scale, expressively distorted figures, and a non-naturalistic use of colour reminiscent of the work of [[Fra Angelico]] nearly a century earlier.  Botticelli has been compared to the Venetian painter [[Carlo Crivelli]], some ten years older, whose later work also veers away from the imminent [[High Renaissance]] style, instead choosing to \"move into a distinctly Gothic idiom\".<ref>Legouix, 11\u201312; Dempsey</ref> Other scholars have seen premonitions of [[Mannerism]] in the simplified expressionist depiction of emotions in his works of the last years.<ref>Hartt, 334, 337</ref>  \n\nErnst Steinmann (d. 1934) detected in the later Madonna's a  \"deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's [[physiognomy]]\", which he attributed to Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating of some of these Madonnas.)<ref>Steinmann, Ernst, [https://archive.org/stream/botticelli00steiuoft#page/28/mode/2up ''Botticelli'', 26\u201328]</ref> More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though there is certainly a replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period.\n\nBotticelli continued to pay his dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a [[confraternity]] rather than the [[artist's guild]]) until at least October 1505;<ref>Lightbown, 303\u2013304</ref> the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this.  By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died \"ill and decrepit, at the age of seventy-eight\", after a period when he was \"unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Vasari, 154</ref> He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been something under seventy at the time.  He was buried with his family outside the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti Church]] in a spot the church has now built over.<ref>Lightbown, 305; Ettlingers, 15</ref> This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]''.<ref>Lightbown, 17</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nVasari mentions that Botticelli produced very fine drawings, which were sought out by artists after his death.<ref>Vasari, 155</ref> Apart from the Dante illustrations, only a small number of these survive, none of which can be connected with surviving paintings, or at least not their final compositions, although they appear to be preparatory drawings rather than independent works.  Some may be connected with the work in other media that we know Botticelli did.  Three [[vestment]]s survive with embroidered designs by him, and he developed a new technique for decorating banners for religious and secular processions, apparently in some kind of [[appliqu\u00e9]] technique.<ref>Lightbown, 296\u2013298: Ettlingers, 175\u2013178, who are more ready to connect studies to surviving paintings.</ref>\n\n==Workshop==\n[[File:Botticelli, madonna della melagrana 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna of the Pomegranate]]'' (''Madonna della Melagrana''), c.&nbsp;1487]]\nIn 1472 the records of the painter's guild record that Botticelli had only Filippino Lippi as an assistant, though another source records a twenty-eight-year old, who had trained with [[Neri di Bicci]].  By 1480 there were three, none of them subsequently of note.   Other names occur in the record, but only Lippi became a well-known master.<ref>Legouix, 8; Lightbown, 311, 314</ref> A considerable number of works, especially Madonnas, are attributed to Botticelli's workshop, or the master and his workshop, generally meaning that Botticelli did the underdrawing, while the assistants did the rest, or drawings by him were copied by the workshop.<ref>Lightbown, 314</ref>  \n\nBotticelli's linear style was relatively easy to imitate, making different contributions within one work hard to identify,<ref>Ettlingers, 79</ref> though the quality of the master's drawing makes works entirely by others mostly identifiable.  The attribution of many works remains debated, especially in terms of distinguishing the share of work between master and workshop.  Lightbown believed that \"the division between Botticelli's autograph works and the paintings from his workshop and circle is a fairly sharp one\", and that in only one major work on panel \"do we find important parts executed by assistants\";<ref>Lightbown, 312</ref> but others might disagree.\n\nThe National Gallery have an ''Adoration of the Kings'' of about 1470, which they describe as begun by Filippino Lippi but finished by Botticelli, noting how unusual it was for a master to take over a work begun by a pupil.<ref>[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-and-filippino-lippi-adoration-of-the-kings National Gallery page]; see Davies, 97 for a slightly different view, and Lightbown, 311 for a very different one.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Finances===\n\nAccording to Vasari's perhaps unreliable account, Botticelli \"earned a great deal of money, but wasted it all through carelessness and lack of management\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He continued to live in the family house all his life, also having his studio there.  On his father's death in 1482 it was inherited by his brother Giovanni, who had a large family. By the end of his life it was owned by his nephews.  From the 1490s he had a modest country villa and farm at Bellosguardo (now swallowed up by the city), which was leased with his brother Simone.<ref>Ettlingers, 12\u201314</ref>\n\n===Sexuality===\n\nBotticelli never married, and apparently expressed a strong dislike of the idea of marriage.  An anecdote records that his patron Tommaso Soderini, who died in 1485, suggested he marry, to which Botticelli replied that a few days before he had dreamed that he had married, woke up \"struck with grief\", and for the rest of the night walked the streets to avoid the dream resuming if he slept again.  The story concludes cryptically that Soderini understood \"that he was not fit ground for planting vines\".<ref>Lightbown, 44</ref>  \n\nThere has been over a century of speculation that Botticelli himself may actually have been homosexual. Many writers observed homo-eroticism in his portraits. The American art historian [[Bernard Berenson]], for example, detected what he believed to be latent homosexuality.<ref>Hudson</ref> In 1938, [[Jacques Mesnil]] discovered a summary of a charge in the Florentine Archives for November 16, 1502, which read simply \"Botticelli keeps a boy\", an accusation of [[sodomy]] (homosexuality). No prosecution was brought. The painter would then have been about fifty-eight. Mesnil dismissed it as a customary slander by which partisans and adversaries of [[Savonarola]] abused each other. Opinion remains divided on whether this is evidence of bisexuality or homosexuality.<ref>Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003</ref> Many have backed Mesnil.<ref>Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', Oxford University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|9780195069754}}; Lightbown, 302</ref> Art historian Scott Nethersole has suggested that a quarter of Florentine men were the subject of similar accusations, which \"seems to have been a standard way of getting at people\"<ref>Scott Nethersole ([[Courtauld Institute]]), quoted in Hudson</ref> but others have cautioned against hasty dismissal of the charge.<ref>Andre Chastel, ''Art et humanisme a Florence au temps de Laurent le Magnifique'', Presses Universitaires de France, 1959</ref> Mesnil nevertheless concluded \"woman was not the only object of his love\".<ref>Jacques Mesnil, ''Botticelli'', Paris, 1938</ref>\n\nThe Renaissance art historian, James Saslow, has noted that: \"His [Botticelli's] homo-erotic sensibility surfaces mainly in religious works where he imbued such nude young saints as Sebastian with the same androgynous grace and implicit physicality as Donatello's David\".<ref>James Saslow, ''Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in art and society, Yale University Pres, New Haven, 1986, p88</ref>\n\n==Later reputation==\n[[File:Vasari - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait, probably imagined, of Botticelli from Vasari's ''Life'']]\nAfter his death, Botticelli's reputation was eclipsed longer and more thoroughly than that of any other major European artist.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} His paintings remained in the churches and villas for which they had been created,<ref>''Primavera'' and ''The Birth of Venus'' remained in the Grand Ducal Medici villa of Castello until 1815.

Vasari's ''Life'' is relatively short and, especially in the first edition of 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers \"he is clearly ill at ease with Sandro and did not know how to fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from [[Cimabue]] to Michelangelo\".<ref>Ettlingers, 203</ref> Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with [[Francesco Botticini]], another Florentine painter of the day.  Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day.  Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation.  He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli.<ref>Lightbown, 16\u201317; Vasari, 147\u2013155</ref>  Vasari was born the year after Botticelli's death, but would have known many Florentines with memories of him. \n\nIn 1621 a picture-buying agent of [[Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] bought him a painting said to be a Botticelli out of historical interest \"as from the hand of an artist by whom Your Highness has nothing, and who was the master of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\".<ref>Lightbown, 14</ref> That mistake is perhaps understandable, as although Leonardo was only some six years younger than Botticelli, his style could seem to a Baroque judge to be a generation more advanced. \n\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna of the Book]]'', c.1480\u20133.]]\nThe ''Birth of Venus'' was displayed in the Uffizi from 1815, but is little mentioned in travellers' accounts of the gallery over the next two decades.  The [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin|Berlin gallery]] bought the ''[[#Bardi Altarpiece|Bardi Altarpiece]]'' in 1829, but the [[National Gallery, London]] only bought a Madonna (now regarded as by his workshop) in 1855.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> \n\nThe English collector [[William Young Ottley]] bought Botticelli's ''[[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|The Mystical Nativity]]'' in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799.

His only large painting with a mythological subject ever to be sold on the open market is the ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'', bought at [[Christie's]] by the National Gallery for a rather modest \u00a31,050 in 1874.<ref>Reitlinger, 99, 127</ref>\n\nThe first nineteenth-century art historian to be enthusiastic about Botticelli's Sistine frescoes was [[Alexis-Fran\u00e7ois Rio]]; [[Anna Brownell Jameson]] and [[Charles Eastlake]] were alerted to Botticelli as well, and works by his hand began to appear in German collections.

republic]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] located in [[Soviet Central Asia]].\n\nDuring the [[Russian Empire]], the Turkestan ASSR's territory was governed as [[Turkestan Krai]], the [[Emirate of Bukhara]], and the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. From 1905, [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] ideologues like [[Ismail Gasprinski]] aimed to suppress differences among the peoples who spoke [[Turkic languages]], uniting them into one government.<ref name=\"Yalcin\">{{cite book |title=The Rebirth of Uzbekistan: Politics, Economy, and Society in the Post-Soviet Era |first=Resul |last=Yalcin |publisher=Garnet & Ithaca Press |year=2002 |pages=36\u201338, 163\u2013164 }}</ref> \n\nThis idea was supported by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s in [[Tashkent]] created the Turkestan ASSR. But in February 1918, the Islamic Council ({{lang-uz|Shuroi Islamia}}) and the Council of Intelligentsia (Uzb.
