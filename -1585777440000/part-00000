While [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden remained neutral during World War II and avoided direct warfare]], the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] in 1939 ordered all medieval stained glass windows on Gotland to be removed and brought to the mainland for safekeeping as a precautionary measure in case of war. A research team under the leadership of art historian [[Johnny Roosval]] took this opportunity to make a close study of the all the window panes, and published the results in a book in 1950.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=vii\u2013ix}} Roosval grouped the windows together and assigned [[notname]]s to the assumed artists or workshops on stylistic grounds. All in all, Roosval claimed to have identified 19 workshops, schools or artists producing stained glass for the churches of Gotland.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=154\u2013214}} In 1964, art historian Aron Andersson published a complete inventory of all known medieval stained glass windows in Sweden.{{sfn|Lindgren|1964|p=414}} Andersson acknowledges the notnames of Roosval but uses them only sparingly; he also highlights the difficulties in determining the artistic influences different workshops may have had on each other, whether some works came from different workshops or from different artists within the same workshop, problems concerning determining a chronology between them and even whether it is possible to determine if there ever were any artistically independent glass workshops established on Gotland at all during the Middle Ages, especially given the lack of written sources.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=45}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=57}} In the standard multi-volume art history of Sweden ''Signmus svenska konstistoria'' from 1996, Mereth Lindgren mentions only three of the notnames invented by Roosval.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415\u2013418}}\n\nIn total, 165 medieval stained glass panes with figurative depictions and a few purely ornamental panes survive to this day in Sweden, coming from in total 37 churches in the country. Of these, 31 are from [[List of churches on Gotland|churches on Gotland]]. Of the glass found on mainland Sweden, only a few are in their original location and none in their original framing.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=132}} The total area of medieval stained glass amounts to circa {{convert|60|m2|sqft}}, most of it from the time period between 1225 and 1350.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=414}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=11}} Among the [[Nordic countries]], Sweden has the largest amount of preserved medieval stained glass.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=11}} Compared with a country like France or the United Kingdom, it is however a very small amount; the remaining medieval stained glass in Sweden would not suffice to decorate a middle-sized Gothic cathedral.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=414}} A very small number of medieval stained glass has also found its way to Sweden in more recent times; e.g. the chapel at [[Ulriksdal Palace]] contains some medieval stained glass window panes of Swiss origin, bought by Charles XV of Sweden and subsequently installed in the chapel.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=148}}\n\n==Style and development==\n[[File:Gotland-Dalhem Kyrka Glasmalerei 11.jpg|thumb|right|Dalhem Church: one of the oldest stained glass windows in Sweden, showing Byzantine influences mixed with Western attributes]]\nAlthough stemming from a relatively short period of time, and despite the fact that a reduced number of window panes remain, certain stylistic characteristics and trends can be indetified among the stained glass from Sweden.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=46\u2013111}}{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=4\u201369}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415\u2013419}} Particular attention has been paid to the churches on Gotland, since the by far largest amount of medieval stained glass comes from there.

These early works are characterised by an influence from [[Byzantine art]]. Stylistically related works can be found in Western Germany, particularly [[Westphalia]], and notably in [[St. Elizabeth's Church, Marburg]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415}}{{sfn|Lindblom|1914|p=72}}{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=6}} Comparisons have also been made with windows in {{ill|Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche|de|Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche (Erfurt)}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=46}} in [[Erfurt]] and [[Neukloster]] monastery.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=7}} The Byzantine influence, as seen e.g. in the representation of [[Christ Pantocrator]], thus probably arrived with craftsmen from western Germany, who are also known to have been active as tradesmen on the island at this time. A clearly Western element in the aforementioned representation of Christ is thus e.g. the [[cross flag]] that Christ holds.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=47}} Roosval also notes that a particular way of depicting the hair of Christ can be seen in the window in Dalhem, in Marburg and in the Byzantine mosaics in [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]] on Sicily; his conclusion is that the stylistic influence from Sicily may have reached Germany perhaps via the court of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], and from Germany to Gotland.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=5\u20137}} Apart from Dalhem, window panes of broadly the same style and age are also known from [[Atlingbo Church|Atlingbo]], [[Barlingbo Church|Barlingbo]], [[Eksta Church|Eksta]], [[Endre Church|Endre]], [[Lojsta Church|Lojsta]], [[Rone Church|Rone]], [[Sjonhem Church|Sjonhem]] and [[V\u00e4skinde Church|V\u00e4skinde]] churches.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415\u2013417}}\n\n===Early Gothic===\n[[File:Klinte Church, Crucifixion.jpg|thumb|left|Early Gothic influences can be seen in the ''contrapposto'' of the figures in a window formerly in Klinte Church]]\nDuring the period c. 1270\u20131310 stained glass windows were made for i.a. the churches of [[Alskog Church|Alskog]], [[Ardre Church|Ardre]] and [[Klinte Church|Klinte]]. The windows in Alskog are lighter than the earlier windows in Dalhem, and the stylistic influences may according to Roosval have come via Norway from England, rather than as before from Germany.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=25\u201342}} Aron Andersson is critical of this assumption but notes that the composition has elements which would develop in many [[International Gothic]] works of art, and cites especially the ''[[contrapposto]]'' of the figures in the Crucifixion scene in Klinte. The windows in Alskog furthermore contain depictions of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic architectural elements]].{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=85}} Some Byzantine elements still linger, however, for example in the representation of the [[Last Supper]] in Alskog.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=85}}\n\n===High Gothic===\nDuring the first half of the 14th century, a number of stylistically differentiated but clearly Gothic works survive on Gotland.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=43}} Among the few well-preserved medieval stained glass windows on mainland Sweden, one from {{ill|Sk\u00e4rkind Church|sv|Sk\u00e4rkinds kyrka}} in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] and three from {{ill|Sk\u00f6llersta Church|sv|Sk\u00f6llersta kyrka}} in [[N\u00e4rke]] also date from this period.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=419}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=139}} The only preserved medieval stained glass from [[Norrland]] is also a high Gothic pane originally from {{ill|Bjur\u00e5ker Church|sv|Bjur\u00e5kers kyrka}}; it shows few similarities with other Swedish glass windows but is stylistically close to windows found in [[Wienhausen Abbey]], Germany.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=141}} The most well-preserved set of medieval stained glass windows however, is that of Lye Church; it is the most well-preserved set of medieval stained glass in the Nordic countries.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=418}}{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=46}}<ref name=lye>{{cite book |last=Lagerl\u00f6f|first=Erland|date= 1965|title= Lye kyrka (in: Kyrkor p\u00e5 Gotland : Garde ting : s\u00f6dra delen)|series= Sveriges kyrkor, konsthistoriskt inventarium|language= Swedish|volume= 105|pages=51\u201355|url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/handle/raa/6950|location= Stockholm|publisher= Esselte|issn=0284-1894}}</ref> The style of these windows may have been influenced by English or northern German (possibly [[L\u00fcbeck]]) contemporary art.<ref name=lye/>{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=105}} The Gothic character is expressed through elongated, ethereal figures, an airy composition, a delicate ornamentation, and a cooler scale of colours. In some panes the [[iconography]] is also decidedly Gothic (e.g. in the depiction of one of the figures in the [[mocking of Christ|mocking of Jesus]] scene), even though the representation of subject matter on Gotland remained conservative.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=98}} Other churches with high Gothic windows on Gotland are [[Bunge Church|Bunge]], [[Burs Church|Burs]], [[Eskelhem Church|Eskelhem]], [[Etelhem Church|Etelhem]] and [[Vall Church|Vall]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=418}}\n\n===Middle and second half of the 14th century===\n[[File:Birth of Christ, Hablingbo Church.jpg|thumb|right|Nativity scene, formerly in Hablingbo Church]]\nThis period is called \"counter-Gothic\" in Swedish literature, and indicates heavier lines and coarser figures. The colours are sharper and the depictions more clearly narrative than in earlier windows, with attempts at a more realistic depiction of subjects including attempts at rendering a correct [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The iconography was partially renewed, for example in the treatment of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity scene]] formerly in [[H\u00f6rsne Church]], or as in the relatively well-preserved suite of stained glass windows still in [[Hejde Church]]. The latter is also the last of the medieval church windows found on Gotland; no later examples are known. They date from the late 14th century. Other examples are known from [[Barlingbo Church|Barlingbo]] and [[M\u00e4sterby Church|M\u00e4sterby]] churches.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=419}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=124}}\n\n===Later stained glass===\nA fragmentary amount of stained glass paintings from the 15th and 16th century survive on mainland Sweden. These are of a significantly different style than the earlier works; rather than using several pieces of coloured glass to build a kind of mosaic, the technique used during this time is to paint on clear glass, creating a very different impression. An example is the glass pane depicting the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] originally in {{ill|Tors\u00e5ng Church|sv|Tors\u00e5ngs kyrka}}.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=419}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last= Andersson|first= Aron|date= 1964|title= Die Glasmalereien des Mittelalters in Skandinavien (Corpus vitrearum Medii Aevi Skandinavien)|url= |location= Stockholm|publisher= Kungl.

While [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden remained neutral during World War II and avoided direct warfare]], the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] in 1939 ordered all medieval stained glass windows on Gotland to be removed and brought to the mainland for safekeeping as a precautionary measure in case of war. A research team under the leadership of art historian [[Johnny Roosval]] took this opportunity to make a close study of the all the window panes, and published the results in a book in 1950.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=vii\u2013ix}} Roosval grouped the windows together and assigned [[notname]]s to the assumed artists or workshops on stylistic grounds. All in all, Roosval claimed to have identified 19 workshops, schools or artists producing stained glass for the churches of Gotland.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=154\u2013214}} In 1964, art historian Aron Andersson published a complete inventory of all known medieval stained glass windows in Sweden.{{sfn|Lindgren|1964|p=414}} Andersson acknowledges the notnames of Roosval but uses them only sparingly; he also highlights the difficulties in determining the artistic influences different workshops may have had on each other, whether some works came from different workshops or from different artists within the same workshop, problems concerning determining a chronology between them and even whether it is possible to determine if there ever were any artistically independent glass workshops established on Gotland at all during the Middle Ages, especially given the lack of written sources.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=45}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=57}} In the standard multi-volume art history of Sweden ''Signmus svenska konstistoria'' from 1996, Mereth Lindgren mentions only three of the notnames invented by Roosval.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415\u2013418}}\n\nIn total, 165 medieval stained glass panes with figurative depictions and a few purely ornamental panes survive to this day in Sweden, coming from in total 37 churches in the country. Of these, 31 are from [[List of churches on Gotland|churches on Gotland]]. Of the glass found on mainland Sweden, only a few are in their original location and none in their original framing.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=132}} The total area of medieval stained glass amounts to circa {{convert|60|m2|sqft}}, most of it from the time period between 1225 and 1350.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=414}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=11}} Among the [[Nordic countries]], Sweden has the largest amount of preserved medieval stained glass.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=11}} Compared with a country like France or the United Kingdom, it is however a very small amount; the remaining medieval stained glass in Sweden would not suffice to decorate a middle-sized Gothic cathedral.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=414}} A very small number of medieval stained glass has also found its way to Sweden in more recent times; e.g. the chapel at [[Ulriksdal Palace]] contains some medieval stained glass window panes of Swiss origin, bought by Charles XV of Sweden and subsequently installed in the chapel.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=148}}\n\n==Style and development==\n[[File:Gotland-Dalhem Kyrka Glasmalerei 11.jpg|thumb|right|Dalhem Church: one of the oldest stained glass windows in Sweden, showing Byzantine influences mixed with Western attributes]]\nAlthough stemming from a relatively short period of time, and despite the fact that a reduced number of window panes remain, certain stylistic characteristics and trends can be indetified among the stained glass from Sweden.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=46\u2013111}}{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=4\u201369}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415\u2013419}} Particular attention has been paid to the churches on Gotland, since the by far largest amount of medieval stained glass comes from there. It has been assumed that the windows surviving in these countryside churches were made by workshops operating in or mainly for [[Visby]]; however, [[List of church ruins on Gotland|all the medieval churches of Visby are today in ruins]], with the exception of [[Visby Cathedral]].{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=7}}\n\n===Early stained glass===\nThe oldest stained glass windows preserved ''in situ'' in Sweden are found in [[Dalhem Church]] on Gotland.<ref name=dalhem>{{cite book |last= Roosval|first= Johnny|date= 1952|title= Dalhems kyrka (in: Kyrkor i Halla ting, norra delen)|series= Sveriges kyrkor, konsthistoriskt inventarium|language= Swedish|volume= 66|url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/handle/raa/6911|location= Stockholm|publisher= Generalstabens Litografiska Anstalt|pages= 184|issn=0284-1894}}</ref> Five of the thirteen window panes in the eastern choir window are original; the rest date from a restoration done in a medieval revival style 1899\u20131914.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415}} Each window pane is approximately {{convert|50|cm|inch}} by {{convert|60|cm|inch}} large.{{sfn|Lindblom|1914|p=72}} These five windows probably date from c. 1230\u20131250; a somewhat later window in one of the northern choir wall (c. 1250\u20131280) show similar stylistic traits. These early works are characterised by an influence from [[Byzantine art]]. Stylistically related works can be found in Western Germany, particularly [[Westphalia]], and notably in [[St. Elizabeth's Church, Marburg]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415}}{{sfn|Lindblom|1914|p=72}}{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=6}} Comparisons have also been made with windows in {{ill|Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche|de|Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche (Erfurt)}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=46}} in [[Erfurt]] and [[Neukloster]] monastery.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=7}} The Byzantine influence, as seen e.g. in the representation of [[Christ Pantocrator]], thus probably arrived with craftsmen from western Germany, who are also known to have been active as tradesmen on the island at this time. A clearly Western element in the aforementioned representation of Christ is thus e.g. the [[cross flag]] that Christ holds.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=47}} Roosval also notes that a particular way of depicting the hair of Christ can be seen in the window in Dalhem, in Marburg and in the Byzantine mosaics in [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]] on Sicily; his conclusion is that the stylistic influence from Sicily may have reached Germany perhaps via the court of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], and from Germany to Gotland.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=5\u20137}} Apart from Dalhem, window panes of broadly the same style and age are also known from [[Atlingbo Church|Atlingbo]], [[Barlingbo Church|Barlingbo]], [[Eksta Church|Eksta]], [[Endre Church|Endre]], [[Lojsta Church|Lojsta]], [[Rone Church|Rone]], [[Sjonhem Church|Sjonhem]] and [[V\u00e4skinde Church|V\u00e4skinde]] churches.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=415\u2013417}}\n\n===Early Gothic===\n[[File:Klinte Church, Crucifixion.jpg|thumb|left|Early Gothic influences can be seen in the ''contrapposto'' of the figures in a window formerly in Klinte Church]]\nDuring the period c. 1270\u20131310 stained glass windows were made for i.a. the churches of [[Alskog Church|Alskog]], [[Ardre Church|Ardre]] and [[Klinte Church|Klinte]]. The windows in Alskog are lighter than the earlier windows in Dalhem, and the stylistic influences may according to Roosval have come via Norway from England, rather than as before from Germany.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=25\u201342}} Aron Andersson is critical of this assumption but notes that the composition has elements which would develop in many [[International Gothic]] works of art, and cites especially the ''[[contrapposto]]'' of the figures in the Crucifixion scene in Klinte. The windows in Alskog furthermore contain depictions of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic architectural elements]].{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=85}} Some Byzantine elements still linger, however, for example in the representation of the [[Last Supper]] in Alskog.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=85}}\n\n===High Gothic===\nDuring the first half of the 14th century, a number of stylistically differentiated but clearly Gothic works survive on Gotland.{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=43}} Among the few well-preserved medieval stained glass windows on mainland Sweden, one from {{ill|Sk\u00e4rkind Church|sv|Sk\u00e4rkinds kyrka}} in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] and three from {{ill|Sk\u00f6llersta Church|sv|Sk\u00f6llersta kyrka}} in [[N\u00e4rke]] also date from this period.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=419}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=139}} The only preserved medieval stained glass from [[Norrland]] is also a high Gothic pane originally from {{ill|Bjur\u00e5ker Church|sv|Bjur\u00e5kers kyrka}}; it shows few similarities with other Swedish glass windows but is stylistically close to windows found in [[Wienhausen Abbey]], Germany.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=141}} The most well-preserved set of medieval stained glass windows however, is that of Lye Church; it is the most well-preserved set of medieval stained glass in the Nordic countries.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=418}}{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=46}}<ref name=lye>{{cite book |last=Lagerl\u00f6f|first=Erland|date= 1965|title= Lye kyrka (in: Kyrkor p\u00e5 Gotland : Garde ting : s\u00f6dra delen)|series= Sveriges kyrkor, konsthistoriskt inventarium|language= Swedish|volume= 105|pages=51\u201355|url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/handle/raa/6950|location= Stockholm|publisher= Esselte|issn=0284-1894}}</ref> The style of these windows may have been influenced by English or northern German (possibly [[L\u00fcbeck]]) contemporary art.<ref name=lye/>{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=105}} The Gothic character is expressed through elongated, ethereal figures, an airy composition, a delicate ornamentation, and a cooler scale of colours. In some panes the [[iconography]] is also decidedly Gothic (e.g. in the depiction of one of the figures in the [[mocking of Christ|mocking of Jesus]] scene), even though the representation of subject matter on Gotland remained conservative.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=98}} Other churches with high Gothic windows on Gotland are [[Bunge Church|Bunge]], [[Burs Church|Burs]], [[Eskelhem Church|Eskelhem]], [[Etelhem Church|Etelhem]] and [[Vall Church|Vall]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=418}}\n\n===Middle and second half of the 14th century===\n[[File:Birth of Christ, Hablingbo Church.jpg|thumb|right|Nativity scene, formerly in Hablingbo Church]]\nThis period is called \"counter-Gothic\" in Swedish literature, and indicates heavier lines and coarser figures. The colours are sharper and the depictions more clearly narrative than in earlier windows, with attempts at a more realistic depiction of subjects including attempts at rendering a correct [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The iconography was partially renewed, for example in the treatment of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity scene]] formerly in [[H\u00f6rsne Church]], or as in the relatively well-preserved suite of stained glass windows still in [[Hejde Church]]. The latter is also the last of the medieval church windows found on Gotland; no later examples are known. They date from the late 14th century. Other examples are known from [[Barlingbo Church|Barlingbo]] and [[M\u00e4sterby Church|M\u00e4sterby]] churches.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=419}}{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=124}}\n\n===Later stained glass===\nA fragmentary amount of stained glass paintings from the 15th and 16th century survive on mainland Sweden. These are of a significantly different style than the earlier works; rather than using several pieces of coloured glass to build a kind of mosaic, the technique used during this time is to paint on clear glass, creating a very different impression. An example is the glass pane depicting the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] originally in {{ill|Tors\u00e5ng Church|sv|Tors\u00e5ngs kyrka}}.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=419}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last= Andersson|first= Aron|date= 1964|title= Die Glasmalereien des Mittelalters in Skandinavien (Corpus vitrearum Medii Aevi Skandinavien)|url= |location= Stockholm|publisher= Kungl.

Around 1879 John M. Balch and his family settled south of Mesquite in unincorporated Dallas County. Mr. Balch found several [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] on his land, one of which ran year-round. Local residents began referring to the springs on Mr. Balch's property as Balch Springs, and use of the name continued even after he moved away a few years after his arrival. Around 1885, a county school was named after the springs. A small church and a cemetery were near the school.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} During the early 1900s, the community was widely dispersed and consisted mostly of farms. Electricity, provided by Texas Power and Light, was introduced in 1939. Gas and telephone service arrived shortly after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\" />\n\nThe community began to grow rapidly along with the city of Dallas and other Dallas County towns. To avoid annexation by Dallas, Balch Springs incorporated as a city on June 13, 1953.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\" /> The new city encompassed the communities of Balch Springs, Zipp City, Five Points, Jonesville, and Triangle as well as portions of [[Rylie, Dallas, Texas|Rylie]] and [[Kleberg, Dallas|Kleberg]].<ref name=\"Early Days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.balchspringschamber.org/BalchSpringsTheEarlyDays.pdf  | title = Balch Springs: The Early Days | format = | work = | publisher = Balch Springs Chamber of Commerce | date = | accessdate = 2009-09-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070902061325/http://www.balchspringschamber.org/BalchSpringsTheEarlyDays.pdf |archivedate = 2007-09-02}}</ref> A mayor-council form of government was adopted after incorporation. By 1956, Balch Springs had a population of around 3,500. The city was home to 6,821 residents at the 1960 census. In September 1964, a post office opened in the city and in 1965, the first taxes were levied. A 1966 attempt to disincorporate the community was unsuccessful. By 1970, the population had risen to 10,464 as the construction of new roads made commuting to surrounding cities easier. In 1988, residents voted to become part of the neighboring city of Mesquite, but the election was declared invalid.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\" /> Two years later, the 1990 census reported a total of 17,406 people living in the city. The 2000 population was 19,375.\n\nThe [[murder of Jordan Edwards]] occurred in Balch Springs in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hoyt, Joseph|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/high-school-sports/football/2019/11/07/jordan-edwards-was-murdered-31-months-ago-the-mesquite-football-team-can-finally-honor-their-fallen-brother-on-their-own-terms/|title=Jordan Edwards was murdered 31 months ago.

Around 1879 John M. Balch and his family settled south of Mesquite in unincorporated Dallas County. Mr. Balch found several [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] on his land, one of which ran year-round. Local residents began referring to the springs on Mr. Balch's property as Balch Springs, and use of the name continued even after he moved away a few years after his arrival. Around 1885, a county school was named after the springs. A small church and a cemetery were near the school.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} During the early 1900s, the community was widely dispersed and consisted mostly of farms. Electricity, provided by Texas Power and Light, was introduced in 1939. Gas and telephone service arrived shortly after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\" />\n\nThe community began to grow rapidly along with the city of Dallas and other Dallas County towns. To avoid annexation by Dallas, Balch Springs incorporated as a city on June 13, 1953.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\" /> The new city encompassed the communities of Balch Springs, Zipp City, Five Points, Jonesville, and Triangle as well as portions of [[Rylie, Dallas, Texas|Rylie]] and [[Kleberg, Dallas|Kleberg]].<ref name=\"Early Days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.balchspringschamber.org/BalchSpringsTheEarlyDays.pdf  | title = Balch Springs: The Early Days | format = | work = | publisher = Balch Springs Chamber of Commerce | date = | accessdate = 2009-09-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070902061325/http://www.balchspringschamber.org/BalchSpringsTheEarlyDays.pdf |archivedate = 2007-09-02}}</ref> A mayor-council form of government was adopted after incorporation. By 1956, Balch Springs had a population of around 3,500. The city was home to 6,821 residents at the 1960 census. In September 1964, a post office opened in the city and in 1965, the first taxes were levied. A 1966 attempt to disincorporate the community was unsuccessful. By 1970, the population had risen to 10,464 as the construction of new roads made commuting to surrounding cities easier. In 1988, residents voted to become part of the neighboring city of Mesquite, but the election was declared invalid.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\" /> Two years later, the 1990 census reported a total of 17,406 people living in the city.

Near Balapur he founded a new city named [[Shahapur, Buldhana|Shahpur]] and constructed a beautiful palace for himself which is now in ruins. As his relationship was deteriorating with [[Abdul Raheem Khan-I-Khanan|Abdur Raheem Khan-i-Khanan]], the commander of the army, Akbar recalled the Khan-i-Khanan and sent his trusted friend [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]] to help him. After the fall of Ahmadnagar, Balapur was still the principal garrison town of Berar, but the next prince sent to administer the Deccan after the death of Murad, [[Prince Daniyal|Daniyal Mirza]] preferred [[Burhanpur]], as his viceregal capital. Daniyal died of drink in 1605. The death of his third son was a severe shock to the Emperor Akbar, who survived Daniyal Mirza only for a few months, and died in October 1605, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Salim (Jehangir). The climate of Balapur had an unfortunate effect on the Mughal officers. Akbar's son Murad had already died there from the effects of drink, and in 1617 Raja Maan Singh, a distinguished and valued officer of Jahangir's, died there from the same cause. Shahnawaz Khan succumbed to the same fate a few years later. Balapur was one of the richest Pargana in [[Berar Subah]].\n\nMuhammad Azam Shah, Son of [[Aurangzeb]] resided and build a Mud fort here.

Near Balapur he founded a new city named [[Shahapur, Buldhana|Shahpur]] and constructed a beautiful palace for himself which is now in ruins. As his relationship was deteriorating with [[Abdul Raheem Khan-I-Khanan|Abdur Raheem Khan-i-Khanan]], the commander of the army, Akbar recalled the Khan-i-Khanan and sent his trusted friend [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]] to help him. After the fall of Ahmadnagar, Balapur was still the principal garrison town of Berar, but the next prince sent to administer the Deccan after the death of Murad, [[Prince Daniyal|Daniyal Mirza]] preferred [[Burhanpur]], as his viceregal capital. Daniyal died of drink in 1605. The death of his third son was a severe shock to the Emperor Akbar, who survived Daniyal Mirza only for a few months, and died in October 1605, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Salim (Jehangir). The climate of Balapur had an unfortunate effect on the Mughal officers. Akbar's son Murad had already died there from the effects of drink, and in 1617 Raja Maan Singh, a distinguished and valued officer of Jahangir's, died there from the same cause. Shahnawaz Khan succumbed to the same fate a few years later. Balapur was one of the richest Pargana in [[Berar Subah]].\n\nMuhammad Azam Shah, Son of [[Aurangzeb]] resided and build a Mud fort here.

Settlements have existed in the valley since [[Late Antiquity]]. \nThe founding of Bakhchysaray was preceded by the Q\u0131rq Yer fortress (modern [[Chufut-Kale|\u00c7ufut Qale]]), Sala\u00e7\u0131q, and [[Eski Yurt]] \u2014 these have become incorporated into the urban area of modern Bakhchisaray.\n\nBakhchysarai first appears in historical documents in 1502. In 1532 [[Sahib I Giray]], the [[List of Crimean khans|Khan of Crimea]] from 1532 to 1551, established  his residence there. From that time it served as the capital of the [[Crimean Khanate]] and the center of political and cultural life of the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] people. After several wars with Russia from 1737 (when General [[Burkhard Christoph von M\u00fcnnich]] burnt down the capital of the Khanate) and following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|annexation of the Crimean Khanate]] by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1783, Bakhchysarai became an ordinary town, having lost administrative significance. However, it remained the cultural center of the Crimean Tatars for several decades afterward, fostered by [[Ismail Gaspirali]] (1851-1914) who founded the local newspaper [[Terc\u00fcman (Russian Empire)|''Terc\u00fcman'']].\n\nDuring the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u201356, Bakhchysarai essentially became a hospital town as wounded Russian soldiers from the battlefield were brought in to be treated. The [[Battle of the Alma]], one of the earliest battles of the war, was waged not far from the city. But although the city was close to the front line, it was never taken by the Turks and their European allies, as the port city of [[Sevastopol]] was their primary [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|wartime objective]].\n\nWith the collapse of the Russian Empire and the unification of several socialist republics that had been part of the Russian Empire, Bakhchysarai became part of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922.\n\nThe ''[[S\u00fcrg\u00fcn]]'', the deportation of the Crimean Tatars by the Soviets during the [[Second World War]], took place on 18 May 1944 in Bakhchysarai. The expulsion was prompted by accusations that the Tatars had collaborated with the Axis occupiers. Although deportation of some Tatars in Crimea had begun as early as 1860, during the era of the Russian Empire, this served to be the final blow, as the city was rendered empty of Crimean Tatars. They were not to return to the city until 1989, when Soviet policies relaxed.\n\nBakhchysarai became a part of newly independent [[Ukraine]] in 1991.

Settlements have existed in the valley since [[Late Antiquity]]. \nThe founding of Bakhchysaray was preceded by the Q\u0131rq Yer fortress (modern [[Chufut-Kale|\u00c7ufut Qale]]), Sala\u00e7\u0131q, and [[Eski Yurt]] \u2014 these have become incorporated into the urban area of modern Bakhchisaray.\n\nBakhchysarai first appears in historical documents in 1502. In 1532 [[Sahib I Giray]], the [[List of Crimean khans|Khan of Crimea]] from 1532 to 1551, established  his residence there. From that time it served as the capital of the [[Crimean Khanate]] and the center of political and cultural life of the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] people. After several wars with Russia from 1737 (when General [[Burkhard Christoph von M\u00fcnnich]] burnt down the capital of the Khanate) and following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|annexation of the Crimean Khanate]] by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1783, Bakhchysarai became an ordinary town, having lost administrative significance. However, it remained the cultural center of the Crimean Tatars for several decades afterward, fostered by [[Ismail Gaspirali]] (1851-1914) who founded the local newspaper [[Terc\u00fcman (Russian Empire)|''Terc\u00fcman'']].\n\nDuring the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-56, Bakhchysarai essentially became a hospital town as wounded Russian soldiers from the battlefield were brought in to be treated. The [[Battle of the Alma]], one of the earliest battles of the war, was waged not far from the city. But although the city was close to the front line, it was never taken by the Turks and their European allies, as the port city of [[Sevastopol]] was their primary [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|wartime objective]].\n\nWith the collapse of the Russian Empire and the unification of several socialist republics that had been part of the Russian Empire, Bakhchysarai became part of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922.\n\nThe ''[[S\u00fcrg\u00fcn]]'', the deportation of the Crimean Tatars by the Soviets during the [[Second World War]], took place on 18 May 1944 in Bakhchysarai. The expulsion was prompted by accusations that the Tatars had collaborated with the Axis occupiers. Although deportation of some Tatars in Crimea had begun as early as 1860, during the era of the Russian Empire, this served to be the final blow, as the city was rendered empty of Crimean Tatars. They were not to return to the city until 1989, when Soviet policies relaxed.\n\nBakhchysarai became a part of newly independent [[Ukraine]] in 1991. However, it became a ''de facto'' part of the [[Russian Federation]] when [[Russian Armed Forces]] [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|invaded and annexed]] the city and the whole of Crimea in 2014.\n\n==Name and associations==\nSpellings of the town's name in different languages include:\n\n* original [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]: Ba\u011f\u00e7asaray\n* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Bah\u00e7esaray\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0411\u0430\u0445\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0439 - Bakhchisaray\n* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: \u0411\u0430\u0445\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0439 - Bakhchysaray\n\nThe name comes from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0686\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u06cc}} ''b\u0101ghche-sar\u0101y'', which means ''the Garden Palace''.

{"title_page": "HBCU band", "text_new": "[[File:JSUDM.png|thumb|300px|Drum majors of the Jackson State University marching band pictured in 2018.]]\nAn '''Historically Black College and University marching band''' (also known as an '''HBCU band''') is the [[marching band]] sponsored by an [[Historically Black College and University]]. A distinctive \"HBCU-style\" of marching band originated in the American South in the 1940s through the blending of earlier traditions of military music and minstrel shows with a performance repertoire based on popular song.\n\nThe spectator popularity of HBCU bands within the campus communities of their institutions has historically eclipsed that of traditional athletics. One 2009 survey of students and alumni of HBCUs found that more than 83-percent felt that most people attended HBCU [[American football|football]] games only to see the marching band perform. \n\nDifferent studies have linked HBCU membership with both higher and lower rates of academic achievement versus the at-large student population. Among the predominantly male, African-American membership of the ensembles, they have been theorized to support positive identity formation. Instances of death and serious injury have occurred among HBCU band members due to patterns of endemic and often violent [[hazing]]. \n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Patrick_Henry_Rothermel.jpg|thumb|A 1738 statute enacted by the House of Burgesses ordered conscription of \"free mulattos\" and blacks.

The tendency to recruit African-Americans into military bands continued after independence; following the War of 1812, a large number of civilian, all-black brass bands formed among veteran military musicians across the United States, but particularly in [[New Orleans]] where they often adopted the theatrical styles of [[minstrel show]]s.<ref name=\"gasman\"/>\n\n===Early history===\nDrawing on these traditions, the first HBCU band was established in 1890 at [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Normal School]] (later Tuskegee University) under student direction.

A distinctive \"HBCU-style\" of marching band originated in the American South in the 1940s through the blending of earlier traditions of military music and minstrel shows with a performance repertoire based on popular song.\n\nThe spectator popularity of HBCU bands within the campus communities of their institutions has historically eclipsed that of traditional athletics. One 2009 survey of students and alumni of HBCUs found that more than 83-percent felt that most people attended HBCU [[American football|football]] games only to see the marching band perform. \n\nDifferent studies have linked HBCU membership with both higher and lower rates of academic achievement versus the at-large student population. Among the predominantly male, African-American membership of the ensembles, they have been theorized to support positive identity formation. Instances of death and serious injury have occurred among HBCU band members due to patterns of endemic and often violent [[hazing]]. \n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Patrick_Henry_Rothermel.jpg|thumb|A 1738 statute enacted by the House of Burgesses ordered conscription of \"free mulattos\" and blacks.
