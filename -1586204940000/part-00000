The current monarch and [[head of state]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who ascended the throne in 1952.\n\nThe monarch and [[British royal family|their immediate family]] undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and  [[kissing hands|appointing]] the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|commander-in-chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the monarch's [[royal prerogative]], these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and [[precedent]]. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is known as Her (His) Majesty's Government.\n\nThe British monarchy traces its origins from the [[petty kingdom]]s of [[early medieval Scotland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], which consolidated into the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by the 10th century. England was [[Norman conquest of England|conquered by the Normans]] in 1066, after which [[Wales]] too gradually came under control of [[Anglo-Normans]]. The process was completed in the 13th century when the [[Principality of Wales]] became a [[client state]] of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' began a process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a [[Union of the crowns|single sovereign]]. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican [[Commonwealth of England]], which followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] excluded [[Roman Catholics]] and their spouses from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and in 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] joined to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The British monarch was the nominal head of the vast [[British Empire]], which covered a quarter of the world's land area at its greatest extent in 1921.\n\nIn the early 1920s the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] recognised the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the years after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. [[George VI]] and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fifteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The prime minister takes office by attending the monarch in private audience, and after \"[[kissing hands]]\" that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument.<ref>Brazier, p. 312.</ref>\n\nIn a [[hung parliament]] where no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be the leader of the largest party.<ref>Waldron, pp.59\u201360</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|title=Queen and Prime Minister|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref> Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] when [[Harold Wilson]] was appointed Prime Minister after [[Edward Heath]] resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 general election]], in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] (the largest party) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017]], when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.\n\n===Dissolution of Parliament===\nIn 1950 the King's [[Private Secretary]] [[Sir Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan \"Tommy\" Lascelles]], writing pseudonymously to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, asserted a constitutional convention: according to the [[Lascelles Principles]], if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|resulting general election]] gave Wilson a small majority.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/results.htm|title=Results and analysis: General election, 10 October 1974|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Political Science Resources}}</ref> The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss the prime minister, but in practice the prime minister's term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation.

The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx | title=The Queen's working day > Evening | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of prime minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot's words: \"the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy&nbsp;... three rights \u2013 the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\"<ref>Bagehot, p.75</ref>\n\nAlthough the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, \"The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers\", and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.<ref name=PASC>{{citation|title=PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |year=2002 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104135404/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 January 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|Head of the Armed Forces]] (the [[Royal Navy]], the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]]), and accredits British [[High Commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s, and receives [[Head of mission|heads of missions]] from foreign states.<ref name=PASC/>\n\nIt is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which the sovereign reads the [[Speech from the throne]] in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |title=About Parliament: State Opening of Parliament |accessdate=27 April 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=UK Parliament |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119091636/http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=19 November 2002 }}</ref> Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6110930.stm|title=A Guide to Prorogation|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=7 November 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons.

For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign \"can do no wrong\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The sovereign exercises the \"prerogative of mercy\", which is used to [[pardon]] convicted offenders or reduce sentences.<ref name=parl/><ref name=PASC/>\n\nThe monarch is the \"[[fount of honour]]\", the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom.

[[Alfred the Great]] secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western [[Mercia]], and assumed the title \"King of the English\".<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.12\u201313 and 31</ref> His grandson [[\u00c6thelstan]] was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.13\u201317</ref> The [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in 1066 by [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the [[Feudalism|Feudal System]] continued to develop.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.102\u2013127</ref>\n\nWilliam was succeeded by two of his sons: [[William II of England|William II]], then [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]], laid claim to the throne and took power with the support of most of the [[Baron#Barons in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|barons]]. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as [[the Anarchy]]. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda's son [[Henry II of England|Henry]] would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin king of England]] and the first monarch of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]] as Henry II in 1154.<ref>Fraser, pp.30\u201346</ref>\n\nThe reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs [[Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the [[Angevin Empire]]. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the [[Crusades]]. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.\n\nJohn's reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215, the barons coerced the king into issuing [[Magna Carta]] ([[Latin]] for \"Great Charter\") to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the [[First Barons' War]]. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Fraser, pp.54\u201374</ref> Later in Henry's reign, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the [[Second Barons' War]]. The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265.<ref>Fraser, pp.77\u201378</ref>\n\nThe next monarch, [[Edward Longshanks]], was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]]. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, [[Edward II]], who also faced conflict with the nobility.<ref>Fraser, pp.79\u201393</ref> In 1311, Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of [[Ordinances of 1311|baronial \"ordainers\"]]; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322.<ref>Ashley, pp.595\u2013597</ref> Nevertheless, in 1327, Edward was deposed by his wife [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. His 14-year-old son became [[Edward III]]. Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.\n\nHis campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all the gains had been lost. Edward's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson [[Richard II]]. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]] seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.<ref>Fraser, pp.96\u2013115</ref>\n\nHenry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]]; hence, his dynasty was known as the [[House of Lancaster]]. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.<ref>Fraser, pp.118\u2013130</ref>\n\nThe unpopularity of Henry VI's counsellors and his belligerent consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, [[Edward IV]], led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The [[Wars of the Roses]], nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son [[Edward V]] and brother [[Richard III]]. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].<ref>Fraser, pp.133\u2013165</ref>\n\nNow King Henry VII, he neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.295; Fraser, pp.168\u2013176</ref> The reign of the second Tudor king, [[Henry VIII]], was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the [[Pope]] led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the [[Church of England]] (the Anglican Church).<ref>Fraser, pp.179\u2013189</ref>\n\nWales \u2013 which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion \u2013 was annexed to England under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]].<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.194, 265, 309</ref> Henry VIII's son and successor, the young [[Edward VI]], continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating [[Lady Jane Grey]] as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was declared king and co-ruler. He pursued disastrous wars in France and she attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism (burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process). Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister [[Elizabeth I]]. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.<ref>Ashley, pp.636\u2013647 and Fraser, pp.190\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Scottish monarchy===\n{{See also|List of Scottish monarchs}}\nIn Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the [[Picts]] in the north east, the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in the south, including the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], and the [[Gaels]] or [[Scoti|Scotti]] (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the west. [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or [[kingdom of Alba|Alba]] to the Scots).<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.1\u201312, 35</ref> The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.\n\nEarly Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of [[tanistry]] was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the [[House of Alpin]]. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle.<ref>Weir, pp.164\u2013177</ref> In 1005, [[Malcolm II]] ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, [[Duncan I]], instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]], who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]]. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson [[Lulach]], Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.<ref>Ashley, pp.390\u2013395</ref>\n\nWith a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm's sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. David was succeeded by his grandsons [[Malcolm IV]], and then by [[William the Lion]], the longest-reigning King of Scots before the [[Union of the Crowns]].<ref>Ashley, pp.400\u2013407 and Weir, pp.185\u2013198</ref> William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.170</ref> William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]]. Alexander II, as well as his successor [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], attempted to take over the [[Western Isles]], which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing [[Treaty of Perth]] recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.<ref>Ashley, pp.407\u2013409 and Cannon and Griffiths, pp.187, 196</ref>\n\nAlexander III's unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]]. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|13 rival claimants to the throne]]. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced [[John Balliol]] to be king. Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Scotland had no monarch, until [[Robert the Bruce]] declared himself king in 1306.<ref>Ashley, pp.409\u2013412</ref>\n\nRobert's efforts to control Scotland culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, [[David II of Scotland|David II]]. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol's rightful heir, [[Edward Balliol]], the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years.<ref>Ashley, pp.549\u2013552</ref>\n\nDavid II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] of the [[House of Stuart]]. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, [[regent]]s had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III's son [[James I of Scotland|James I]], had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. [[James II of Scotland|James II]] continued his father's policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: [[James IV]].<ref>Ashley, pp.552\u2013565</ref>\n\nIn 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden Field]]; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, [[James V]], was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]]. Once again, a regency was established.\n\nMary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as [[John Knox]], a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son [[James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Ashley, pp.567\u2013575</ref>\n\n===Personal union and republican phase===\n[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|right|In 1603 James VI and I became the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together.]]\nElizabeth I's death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch [[James VI]], who was the great-grandson of [[Henry VIII]]'s older sister and hence Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\". Although England and Scotland were in [[personal union]] under one monarch \u2013 James I became the first monarch to style himself \"King of Great Britain\" in 1604<ref>Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Westminster, 20 October 1604</ref> \u2013 they remained two separate kingdoms. James I's successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and the English [[Puritans]]). His attempt to enforce [[Anglicanism]] led to organised rebellion in Scotland (the \"[[Bishops' Wars]]\") and ignited the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In 1642, the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the [[English Civil War]] began.<ref>Fraser, pp.214\u2013231</ref>\n\nThe Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Charles I's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the [[Battle of Worcester]]. In 1653, [[Oliver Cromwell]], the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself [[Lord Protector]] (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon resigned.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.393\u2013400</ref> The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the [[Restoration (England)|monarchy was restored]] and Charles II returned to Britain.<ref>Fraser, p.232</ref>\n\nCharles II's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] arose; the \"Petitioners\", who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the \"Abhorrers\", who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James's decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison [[Seven Bishops|Church of England clerics who challenged his policies]]. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the [[Immortal Seven]] invited James II's daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of Orange]] to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James II's Catholic son]]) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.242\u2013245</ref>\n\nJames's overthrow, known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne's children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William's nearest Protestant relations, the family of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.439\u2013440</ref> Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne.\n\n===After the 1707 Acts of Union===\n[[File:Anniex.jpg|thumb|right|England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne in 1707.]]\n{{See also|List of British monarchs}}\nAfter Anne's accession, the problem of the succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the [[Act of Security 1704]], threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the [[Alien Act 1705]], threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the [[Acts of Union 1707]], under which England and Scotland were united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.447\u2013448</ref>\n\nIn 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia's son, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[Elector of Hanover]], who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.460\u2013469</ref> Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who is often considered the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], although the title was not then in use.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/walpole_robert.shtml|title=Sir Robert Walpole|accessdate=14 October 2008|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The next monarch, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, [[George III]], Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the [[United States|United States of America]], but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]].<ref>Ashley, pp.677\u2013680</ref>\n\n[[File:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|right|thumb|The union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom occurred in 1801 during the reign of King George III.]]\nFrom 1811 to 1820, George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be [[porphyria]], an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], ruled in his stead as [[Regent of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. During [[Regency era|the Regency]] and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]], and appointed a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]]. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV's reign, the [[Reform Act 1832]], which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.530\u2013550</ref>\n\nThe final transition to a [[constitutional monarchy]] was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]. As a woman, Victoria could not rule [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], which only permitted succession in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The [[Victorian era]] was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world's foremost powers. In recognition of [[British Raj|British rule over India]], Victoria was declared [[Empress of India]] in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican movement]], due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|her husband]] in 1861.<ref>Fraser, pp.305\u2013306</ref>\n\nVictoria's son, [[Edward VII]], became the first monarch of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, [[George V]], changed \"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\" to \"[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]\" in response to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the [[World War I|First World War]]. George V's reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, in 1922.<ref>Fraser, pp.314\u2013333</ref>\n\n===Shared monarchy===\n[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|Map of the British Empire in 1921]]\n[[File:Commonwealth realm map.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#000080|Commonwealth realms}}{{Legend|#5961e6|Overseas territories of Commonwealth realms}}]]\nDuring the twentieth century, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] evolved from the [[British Empire]]. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively; the [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown Colonies]] were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/westmins.htm|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|accessdate=20 April 2008|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Government of Nova Scotia}}</ref> which has been likened to \"a treaty among the Commonwealth countries\".<ref>Justice Rouleau in [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O'Donohue v.

The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom, [[monarch of Canada]], [[monarch of Australia]], and so forth. The independent states within the Commonwealth would share the same monarch in a relationship likened to a [[personal union]].<ref>Zines, Leslie (2008).

The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630\u20131714), a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James I]].\n\nUpon the death of a sovereign, their heir immediately and automatically succeeds (hence the phrase \"[[The king is dead, long live the king!]]\"), and the accession of the new sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an [[Accession Council]] that meets at [[St James's Palace]].<ref name=accessioncouncil>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |title=Accession |accessdate=14 May 2009 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531055207/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |archivedate=31 May 2015 }}</ref> Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths: the [[Accession Declaration]] as first required by the Bill of Rights, and an oath that they will \"maintain and preserve\" the Church of Scotland settlement as required by the Act of Union. The monarch is usually [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Coronation/Coronation.aspx|title=Coronation|accessdate=14 May 2009|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref>\n\nWhen an individual ascends to the throne, it is expected they will reign until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of [[Edward VIII]], had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was [[James VII and II]], who fled into exile in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\n===Restrictions by gender and religion===\n{{See also|Succession to the Crown Act 2013}}\nSuccession was largely governed by [[primogeniture|male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder children inherit before younger ones of the same gender. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[David Cameron]], announced at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011]] that all 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the gender-preference rule for anyone born after the date of the meeting, 28 October 2011.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607|title=Girls Equal in British throne succession|accessdate=28 October 2011|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic \u2013 a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701.

When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.<ref name=regact53>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1121879|title=Regency Act 1953|accessdate=9 October 2008|publisher=Ministry of Justice}}</ref> Since reaching adulthood (in November 1966), [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], has been first in line for the regency.\n\nDuring a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from the kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her functions to [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]], the monarch's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession.

[[King George III]] agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the [[Civil list#United Kingdom|Civil List]], and this arrangement persisted until 2012. An annual Property Services [[grant-in-aid]] paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment.

The current monarch and [[head of state]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who ascended the throne in 1952.\n\nThe monarch and [[British royal family|their immediate family]] undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and  [[kissing hands|appointing]] the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|commander-in-chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the monarch's [[royal prerogative]], these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and [[precedent]]. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is known as Her (His) Majesty's Government.\n\nThe British monarchy traces its origins from the [[petty kingdom]]s of [[early medieval Scotland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], which consolidated into the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by the 10th century. England was [[Norman conquest of England|conquered by the Normans]] in 1066, after which [[Wales]] too gradually came under control of [[Anglo-Normans]]. The process was completed in the 13th century when the [[Principality of Wales]] became a [[client state]] of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' began a process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a [[Union of the crowns|single sovereign]]. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican [[Commonwealth of England]], which followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] excluded [[Roman Catholics]] and their spouses from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and in 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] joined to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The British monarch was the nominal head of the vast [[British Empire]], which covered a quarter of the world's land area at its greatest extent in 1921.\n\nIn the early 1920s the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] recognised the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the years after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. [[George VI]] and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fifteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Although the monarch is shared, each country is sovereign and independent of the others, and the monarch has a different, specific, and official national [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|title and style]] for each realm.\n\n==Constitutional role==\nIn the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], the monarch (otherwise referred to as the [[sovereign]] or \"His/Her [[Majesty]]\", abbreviated H.M.) is the [[head of state]].

The decisions to exercise sovereign powers are delegated from the monarch, either by [[statute]] or by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], to [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]] or officers of [[the Crown]], or other [[public body|public bodies]], exclusive of the monarch personally. Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown, such as Crown Appointments,<ref>Crown Appointments Act 1661 c.6</ref> even if personally performed by the monarch, such as the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]], depend upon decisions made elsewhere:\n* Legislative power is exercised by the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], by and with the advice and consent of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n* Executive power is exercised by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]], which comprises [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]], primarily the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], which is technically a committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

This role has been recognised since the 19th century. The constitutional writer [[Walter Bagehot]] identified the monarchy in 1867 as the \"dignified part\" rather than the \"efficient part\" of government.<ref>Bagehot, p. 9.</ref>\n\n[[File:English Bill of Rights of 1689.jpg|left|thumb|The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]] curtailed the monarch's governmental power.]]\n\n===Appointment of the prime minister===\nWhenever necessary, the monarch is responsible for appointing a new prime minister (who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other [[Minister of the Crown]], and thereby constitutes and controls the government). In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The prime minister takes office by attending the monarch in private audience, and after \"[[kissing hands]]\" that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument.<ref>Brazier, p. 312.</ref>\n\nIn a [[hung parliament]] where no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be the leader of the largest party.<ref>Waldron, pp.59\u201360</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|title=Queen and Prime Minister|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref> Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] when [[Harold Wilson]] was appointed Prime Minister after [[Edward Heath]] resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 general election]], in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] (the largest party) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017]], when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.\n\n===Dissolution of Parliament===\nIn 1950 the King's [[Private Secretary]] [[Sir Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan \"Tommy\" Lascelles]], writing pseudonymously to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, asserted a constitutional convention: according to the [[Lascelles Principles]], if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|resulting general election]] gave Wilson a small majority.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/results.htm|title=Results and analysis: General election, 10 October 1974|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Political Science Resources}}</ref> The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss the prime minister, but in practice the prime minister's term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation. The last monarch to remove the prime minister was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who dismissed [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] in 1834.<ref>Brock, Michael (September 2004; online edition, January 2008). \"William IV (1765\u20131837)\".

The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, exercising prerogative only on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament, often through the prime minister or [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref name=parl>{{citation|author1=Durkin, Mary |author2=Gay, Oonagh |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf|title=The Royal Prerogative|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=21 December 2005|publisher=House of Commons Library |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625170825/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}</ref> In practice, prerogative powers are exercised only on the prime minister's advice \u2013 the prime minister, and not the sovereign, has control. The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx | title=The Queen's working day > Evening | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of prime minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot's words: \"the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy&nbsp;... three rights \u2013 the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\"<ref>Bagehot, p.75</ref>\n\nAlthough the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, \"The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers\", and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.<ref name=PASC>{{citation|title=PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |year=2002 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104135404/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 January 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|Head of the Armed Forces]] (the [[Royal Navy]], the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]]), and accredits British [[High Commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s, and receives [[Head of mission|heads of missions]] from foreign states.<ref name=PASC/>\n\nIt is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which the sovereign reads the [[Speech from the throne]] in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |title=About Parliament: State Opening of Parliament |accessdate=27 April 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=UK Parliament |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119091636/http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=19 November 2002 }}</ref> Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6110930.stm|title=A Guide to Prorogation|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=7 November 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], but can be held sooner if the prime minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons vote to hold an early election.\n\nBefore a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law, the [[royal assent]] (the monarch's approval) is required.<ref>Crabbe, p.17</ref> In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82104.stm|title=Royal Assent|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=24 January 2006|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe monarch has a similar relationship with the [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]].

For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign \"can do no wrong\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The sovereign exercises the \"prerogative of mercy\", which is used to [[pardon]] convicted offenders or reduce sentences.<ref name=parl/><ref name=PASC/>\n\nThe monarch is the \"[[fount of honour]]\", the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom.

[[Alfred the Great]] secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western [[Mercia]], and assumed the title \"King of the English\".<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.12\u201313 and 31</ref> His grandson [[\u00c6thelstan]] was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.13\u201317</ref> The [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in 1066 by [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the [[Feudalism|Feudal System]] continued to develop.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.102\u2013127</ref>\n\nWilliam was succeeded by two of his sons: [[William II of England|William II]], then [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]], laid claim to the throne and took power with the support of most of the [[Baron#Barons in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|barons]]. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result, England descended into a period of disorder known as [[the Anarchy]]. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda's son [[Henry II of England|Henry]] would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin king of England]] and the first monarch of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]] as Henry II in 1154.<ref>Fraser, pp.30\u201346</ref>\n\nThe reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs [[Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the [[Angevin Empire]]. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the [[Crusades]]. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.\n\nJohn's reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215, the barons coerced the king into issuing [[Magna Carta]] ([[Latin]] for \"Great Charter\") to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the [[First Barons' War]]. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Fraser, pp.54\u201374</ref> Later in Henry's reign, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the [[Second Barons' War]]. The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265.<ref>Fraser, pp.77\u201378</ref>\n\nThe next monarch, [[Edward Longshanks]], was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]]. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, [[Edward II]], who also faced conflict with the nobility.<ref>Fraser, pp.79\u201393</ref> In 1311, Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of [[Ordinances of 1311|baronial \"ordainers\"]]; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322.<ref>Ashley, pp.595\u2013597</ref> Nevertheless, in 1327, Edward was deposed by his wife [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. His 14-year-old son became [[Edward III]]. Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.\n\nHis campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all the gains had been lost. Edward's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson [[Richard II]]. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]] seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.<ref>Fraser, pp.96\u2013115</ref>\n\nHenry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]]; hence, his dynasty was known as the [[House of Lancaster]]. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.<ref>Fraser, pp.118\u2013130</ref>\n\nThe unpopularity of Henry VI's counsellors and his belligerent consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]]. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, [[Edward IV]], led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The [[Wars of the Roses]], nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son [[Edward V]] and brother [[Richard III]]. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].<ref>Fraser, pp.133\u2013165</ref>\n\nNow King Henry VII, he neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.295; Fraser, pp.168\u2013176</ref> The reign of the second Tudor king, [[Henry VIII]], was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the [[Pope]] led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the [[Church of England]] (the Anglican Church).<ref>Fraser, pp.179\u2013189</ref>\n\nWales \u2013 which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion \u2013 was annexed to England under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]].<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.194, 265, 309</ref> Henry VIII's son and successor, the young [[Edward VI]], continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating [[Lady Jane Grey]] as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was declared king and co-ruler. He pursued disastrous wars in France and she attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism (burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process). Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister [[Elizabeth I]]. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.<ref>Ashley, pp.636\u2013647 and Fraser, pp.190\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Scottish monarchy===\n{{See also|List of Scottish monarchs}}\nIn Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the [[Picts]] in the north east, the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in the south, including the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], and the [[Gaels]] or [[Scoti|Scotti]] (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the west. [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or [[kingdom of Alba|Alba]] to the Scots).<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.1\u201312, 35</ref> The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed.\n\nEarly Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of [[tanistry]] was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the [[House of Alpin]]. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle.<ref>Weir, pp.164\u2013177</ref> In 1005, [[Malcolm II]] ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, [[Duncan I]], instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]], who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]]. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson [[Lulach]], Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.<ref>Ashley, pp.390\u2013395</ref>\n\nWith a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm's sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. David was succeeded by his grandsons [[Malcolm IV]], and then by [[William the Lion]], the longest-reigning King of Scots before the [[Union of the Crowns]].<ref>Ashley, pp.400\u2013407 and Weir, pp.185\u2013198</ref> William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, p.170</ref> William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]]. Alexander II, as well as his successor [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], attempted to take over the [[Western Isles]], which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing [[Treaty of Perth]] recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.<ref>Ashley, pp.407\u2013409 and Cannon and Griffiths, pp.187, 196</ref>\n\nAlexander III's unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]]. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|13 rival claimants to the throne]]. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced [[John Balliol]] to be king. Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Scotland had no monarch, until [[Robert the Bruce]] declared himself king in 1306.<ref>Ashley, pp.409\u2013412</ref>\n\nRobert's efforts to control Scotland culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, [[David II of Scotland|David II]]. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol's rightful heir, [[Edward Balliol]], the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years.<ref>Ashley, pp.549\u2013552</ref>\n\nDavid II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] of the [[House of Stuart]]. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, [[regent]]s had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III's son [[James I of Scotland|James I]], had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. [[James II of Scotland|James II]] continued his father's policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: [[James IV]].<ref>Ashley, pp.552\u2013565</ref>\n\nIn 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden Field]]; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, [[James V]], was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]]. Once again, a regency was established.\n\nMary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as [[John Knox]], a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son [[James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Ashley, pp.567\u2013575</ref>\n\n===Personal union and republican phase===\n[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|right|In 1603 James VI and I became the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together.]]\nElizabeth I's death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch [[James VI]], who was the great-grandson of [[Henry VIII]]'s older sister and hence Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\". Although England and Scotland were in [[personal union]] under one monarch \u2013 James I became the first monarch to style himself \"King of Great Britain\" in 1604<ref>Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Westminster, 20 October 1604</ref> \u2013 they remained two separate kingdoms. James I's successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish [[Presbyterians]] and the English [[Puritans]]). His attempt to enforce [[Anglicanism]] led to organised rebellion in Scotland (the \"[[Bishops' Wars]]\") and ignited the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In 1642, the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the [[English Civil War]] began.<ref>Fraser, pp.214\u2013231</ref>\n\nThe Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Charles I's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the [[Battle of Worcester]]. In 1653, [[Oliver Cromwell]], the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself [[Lord Protector]] (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon resigned.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.393\u2013400</ref> The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the [[Restoration (England)|monarchy was restored]] and Charles II returned to Britain.<ref>Fraser, p.232</ref>\n\nCharles II's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] arose; the \"Petitioners\", who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the \"Abhorrers\", who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James's decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison [[Seven Bishops|Church of England clerics who challenged his policies]]. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the [[Immortal Seven]] invited James II's daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of Orange]] to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James II's Catholic son]]) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.242\u2013245</ref>\n\nJames's overthrow, known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne's children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William's nearest Protestant relations, the family of [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.439\u2013440</ref> Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne.\n\n===After the 1707 Acts of Union===\n[[File:Anniex.jpg|thumb|right|England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne in 1707.]]\n{{See also|List of British monarchs}}\nAfter Anne's accession, the problem of the succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the [[Act of Security 1704]], threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the [[Alien Act 1705]], threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the [[Acts of Union 1707]], under which England and Scotland were united into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.447\u2013448</ref>\n\nIn 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia's son, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[Elector of Hanover]], who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.460\u2013469</ref> Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who is often considered the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], although the title was not then in use.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/walpole_robert.shtml|title=Sir Robert Walpole|accessdate=14 October 2008|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The next monarch, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, [[George III]], Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the [[United States|United States of America]], but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]].<ref>Ashley, pp.677\u2013680</ref>\n\n[[File:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|right|thumb|The union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom occurred in 1801 during the reign of King George III.]]\nFrom 1811 to 1820, George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be [[porphyria]], an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], ruled in his stead as [[Regent of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. During [[Regency era|the Regency]] and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]], and appointed a Tory, Sir [[Robert Peel]]. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV's reign, the [[Reform Act 1832]], which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.<ref>Cannon and Griffiths, pp.530\u2013550</ref>\n\nThe final transition to a [[constitutional monarchy]] was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]. As a woman, Victoria could not rule [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], which only permitted succession in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The [[Victorian era]] was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world's foremost powers. In recognition of [[British Raj|British rule over India]], Victoria was declared [[Empress of India]] in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican movement]], due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|her husband]] in 1861.<ref>Fraser, pp.305\u2013306</ref>\n\nVictoria's son, [[Edward VII]], became the first monarch of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, [[George V]], changed \"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\" to \"[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]\" in response to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the [[World War I|First World War]]. George V's reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, in 1922.<ref>Fraser, pp.314\u2013333</ref>\n\n===Shared monarchy===\n[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|Map of the British Empire in 1921]]\n[[File:Commonwealth realm map.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#000080|Commonwealth realms}}{{Legend|#5961e6|Overseas territories of Commonwealth realms}}]]\nDuring the twentieth century, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] evolved from the [[British Empire]]. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively; the [[Dominion]]s and [[Crown Colonies]] were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/westmins.htm|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|accessdate=20 April 2008|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Government of Nova Scotia}}</ref> which has been likened to \"a treaty among the Commonwealth countries\".<ref>Justice Rouleau in [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O'Donohue v.

The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom, [[monarch of Canada]], [[monarch of Australia]], and so forth. The independent states within the Commonwealth would share the same monarch in a relationship likened to a [[personal union]].<ref>Zines, Leslie (2008).

Nevertheless, Ireland retained its own parliament, becoming an independent state in 1642-1649 ([[Confederate Ireland]]), and again in 1688-91. Only warfare such as the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] and subsequent occupation enabled the English crown from 1692, and successive British states from 1707, to retain the country.\n\nIn 1800, as a result of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], the Act of Union merged the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

Succession is governed by statutes such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. The rules of succession may only be changed by an [[Act of Parliament]]; it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630\u20131714), a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James I]].\n\nUpon the death of a sovereign, their heir immediately and automatically succeeds (hence the phrase \"[[The king is dead, long live the king!]]\"), and the accession of the new sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an [[Accession Council]] that meets at [[St James's Palace]].<ref name=accessioncouncil>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |title=Accession |accessdate=14 May 2009 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531055207/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx |archivedate=31 May 2015 }}</ref> Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths: the [[Accession Declaration]] as first required by the Bill of Rights, and an oath that they will \"maintain and preserve\" the Church of Scotland settlement as required by the Act of Union. The monarch is usually [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Coronation/Coronation.aspx|title=Coronation|accessdate=14 May 2009|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref>\n\nWhen an individual ascends to the throne, it is expected they will reign until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of [[Edward VIII]], had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was [[James VII and II]], who fled into exile in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\n===Restrictions by gender and religion===\n{{See also|Succession to the Crown Act 2013}}\nSuccession was largely governed by [[primogeniture|male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder children inherit before younger ones of the same gender. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[David Cameron]], announced at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011]] that all 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the gender-preference rule for anyone born after the date of the meeting, 28 October 2011.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607|title=Girls Equal in British throne succession|accessdate=28 October 2011|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic \u2013 a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701.

When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.<ref name=regact53>{{citation|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1121879|title=Regency Act 1953|accessdate=9 October 2008|publisher=Ministry of Justice}}</ref> Since reaching adulthood (in November 1966), [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], has been first in line for the regency.\n\nDuring a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from the kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her functions to [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]], the monarch's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession.

An annual Property Services [[grant-in-aid]] paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment.

The cruise ship, which had left Buenos Aires on 5 March,<ref name=\"chronicleherald17march\" /> had been adrift in the open sea for a day while carrying out routine maintenance on the starboard main engine before reaching her next destination, [[Willemstad]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]]. After having questioned her intentions over radio, the Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel ordered ''RCGS Resolute'' to follow her to  [[Puerto Moreno]] on the eastern side of [[Margarita Island]]. While the master was in contact with the company's head office and [[designated person ashore]] (DPA), warning shots were fired from ''Naiguat\u00e1'' and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow. During an apparent attempt of changing the heading of ''RCGS Resolute'' towards Venezuelan territorial waters, ''Naiguat\u00e1'' came in contact with the cruise ship's [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]], started to take water, and eventually sank.

Her debut album, ''[[This Is the Life (Amy Macdonald album)|This Is the Life]],'' was released on 30 July 2007 and has sold more than 3 million copies, mainly in [[Europe]]. The album charted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] as well as various other European countries like Switzerland. Her second album ''[[A Curious Thing]]'' was released in March 2010.\n\nHer first single, \"[[Poison Prince]]\", was released on 7 May 2007. Other singles released from ''This is the Life,'' \"[[Mr Rock & Roll]]\" and [[This Is the Life (Amy Macdonald song)|the album's title track]], were also successful, reaching the top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and enjoying success elsewhere in [[Europe]], particularly [[Germany]]. \"[[L.A. (Amy Macdonald song)|L.A.]]\" and \"[[Run (Amy Macdonald song)|Run]]\" did not chart on the UK Top 40 but were hits elsewhere in Europe.\n\nMacdonald's second studio album, ''[[A Curious Thing]]'', was released in March 2010. The album's lead single, \"[[Don't Tell Me That It's Over]]\", was a modest hit in the [[United Kingdom]], charting at forty-eight on the UK Singles Chart, but did better in Continental Europe, charting as high as six in [[Germany]] and two in [[Belgium]]. The second single, \"[[Spark (Amy Macdonald song)|Spark]]\", failed to chart in the UK, but charted elsewhere in Europe. Further singles were released from the album which saw success in Europe.\n\nMacdonald's third studio album, ''[[Life in a Beautiful Light]]'' was released in June 2012. The album's lead single, \"[[Slow It Down (Amy Macdonald song)|Slow It Down]]\" was a modest hit in the [[United Kingdom]], charting at forty-five on the UK Singles Chart; it also charted in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].\n\nMacdonald's fourth studio album, ''[[Under Stars]]'' was released on 17 February 2017. \"[[Dream On (Amy Macdonald song)|Dream On]]\" was released as the lead single from the album on 6 January 2017.\n\nIn early 2020 Macdonald has been publishing updates on Instagram that she is currently recording her fifth studio album. The release date has yet to be decided.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]<br><small>([[List of music recording sales certifications|sales thresholds]])</small>\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sales\n|- \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the United Kingdom:\n* For all except where noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2895/amy-macdonald/|title=Amy MacDonald|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|work=Officialcharts.com/}}\n* For \"Poison Prince\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/080531cluk.txt|title=New Chart Entries > 31 May 2008|publisher=Zobbel.de|date=2008-05-31}}\n* For \"This Pretty Face\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/100731cluk.txt|title=New Chart Entries > 31 July 2010|publisher=Zobbel.de|date=2010-07-31}}\n* For \"Love Love\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/101016cluk.txt|title=New Chart Entries > 16 October 2010|publisher=Zobbel.de|date=2010-10-16}}\n* For \"Pride\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/120825cluk.txt|title=New Chart Entries > 25 August 2012|publisher=Zobbel.de|date=2012-08-25}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[\u00d63 Austria Top 40|AUT]]<br/><ref name=\"AUT\">{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Amy+Macdonald|title=Discographie Amy Macdonald|publisher=Austrian Charts Portal.

In the 1930s and 1940s, it stressed national planning, using nationalization of industry as a tool, in line with [[Clause IV]] of the original constitution of the Labour Party which called for the \"common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service\" (this clause was eventually revised in 1994).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clause-iv-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-so-divisive-10447639.html|title=What is Clause IV and why is it so divisive?|work=The Independent|date=9 August 2015|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nLabour has had several spells in government, first as minority governments under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924 and 1929\u20131931. MacDonald and half his cabinet split with the mainstream of the party and were denounced as traitors. Labour was a junior partner in the wartime coalition from 1940\u20131945. After the famous [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] landslide under [[Clement Attlee]] (1945\u20131951) it set up the [[welfare state]] with the [[National Health Service]], nationalised a fifth of the economy, joined [[NATO]] and opposed the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. Under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964\u20131970 it promoted economic modernisation. Labour was in government again in 1974\u20131979 under Wilson and then [[James Callaghan]]. Escalating economic crises (the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\") and a split with [[David Owen]] and others forming the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], resulted in opposition status during the Thatcher years from 1979\u20131990.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nLabour returned with a 179-seat majority in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]]. The party's large majority in the House of Commons was slightly reduced to 167 in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] and more substantially reduced to 66 in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. Under [[Gordon Brown]], it was defeated in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], becoming the opposition to a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition]]. After further losses in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], party leader [[Ed Miliband]] resigned with the party in opposition to a [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative majority government]] under [[David Cameron]].\n\n==Founding of the party==\n===Background===\nThe Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century numeric increase of the urban proletariat and the extension of the [[suffrage|franchise]] to [[working-class]] males, when it became apparent that there was a need for a political party to represent the interests and needs of those groups.<ref>See, for instance, the 1899 [[Lyons vs. Wilkins]] judgement, which limited certain types of picketing</ref> Some members of the trade union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely [[middle-class]] [[Fabian Society]], the [[Social Democratic Federation]] and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888\u20131893)|Scottish Labour Party]].\n\nIt was during this period that British socialism began to make headway in local government. In 1889, [[Progressive Party (London)|a \"Progressive\" party]] composed of [[Fabians]] and [[British Liberals]] took control of [[London County Council]] at the first elections held there. This was the first council to have substantial socialist influence, and carried out a programme of municipalisation, while constructing some of the first social housing in England and increasing public spending on services such as the Fire Brigade.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The Labour Party: A Centenary History edited by Brian Brivati and Richard Hefferman</ref>  In addition, the number of parks and public baths were increased, London's sewerage system was improved, roads were widened and paved, and the [[Blackwall Tunnel]], linking the Isle of Dogs with Greenwich, was opened in 1897.<ref name=\"Yeowell Bates 2008\">{{cite book |last1=Yeowell |first1=Nathan |last2=Bates |first2=Dennis |title=Leading the Way: Labour Local Government's Response to the Credit Crunch |date=2008 |publisher=[[Local Government Association]] |isbn=978-0-9560346-1-8 |url=https://www.leadershipcentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Leading-the-way1.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2019 }}</ref> The [[Women's Labour League]], which was active in the field of social policy, set up a child welfare clinic in Kensington before the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Harmer\">The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900\u20131998 by Harry Harmer</ref>\n\nIn 1892, [[Fred Jowett]] (a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]]) became the first socialist to be elected to [[Bradford City Council]]. A few months later, Jowett founded a branch of the Independent Labour Party in that city. As a member of Bradford City Council, Jowett was responsible for the passage of several important reforms that were eventually adopted by other local authorities. In 1904, for instance, [[Bradford]] became the first local authority in Britain to provide [[free school meal]]s, while a successful campaign led to the clearing of a slum area and its replacement with new houses. Jowett was also a supporter of reforming the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]], and attempted to improve the quality of the food given to the children in the [[Little Horton#Little Horton in the industrial age|Bradford Workhouse]] after being elected as a [[Poor Law Guardians|Poor Law Guardian]].\n\nIn 1898, West Ham borough became the first ever Labour council.<ref>Currents of Radicalism: Popular Radicalism, Organised Labour and Party Politics in Britain, 1850\u20131914 by Eugenio F.

Steels, proposed in his union branch that the [[Trades Union Congress]] call a special conference to bring together all left-wing organisations and form them into a single body that would sponsor Parliamentary candidates. The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the [[Congregational Memorial Hall]] on Farringdon Street on 26 and 27 February 1900. The meeting was attended by a broad spectrum of working-class and left-wing organisations&nbsp;\u2014 trades unions represented about one third of the membership of the TUC delegates.<ref>[http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM \u2018The formation of the Labour Party \u2013 Lessons for today\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622225821/http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM |date=22 June 2008 }} Jim Mortimer, 2000; Jim Mortimer was a General Secretary of the Labour Party in the 1980s</ref>\n\nAfter a debate, the 129 delegates passed Hardie's motion to establish \"a distinct Labour group in Parliament, who shall have their own whips, and agree upon their policy, which must embrace a readiness to cooperate with any party which for the time being may be engaged in promoting legislation in the direct interests of labour\". This created an association called the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), meant to coordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trades unions and represent the working-class population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/history_of_the_labour_party |title=History of the Labour Party |publisher=Labour Party |date=27 February 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414220901/http://www2.labour.org.uk/history_of_the_labour_party |archivedate=14 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|October 1900]] \"Khaki election\" came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to \u00a333.<ref>Wright T. & Carter M, (1997) ''\"The People's Party\"'' Thames & Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-27956-X}}</ref> Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful; [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nSupport for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay \u00a323,000 damages for a strike. The judgment effectively made strikes illegal since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the Liberal Party in opposition to the Conservative's landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.<ref>Norman McCord, \"Taff Vale Revisited,\" ''History'' 78#253 (1993), pp. 243\u2013260 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24421680 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]\n\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats\u2014helped by a [[Lib-Lab pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and Liberal [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.<ref>Frank Bealey, \"The Electoral Arrangement between the Labour Representation Committee and the Liberal Party,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 28#4 (1956), pp. 353\u2013373 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871799 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nIn their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name \"The Labour Party\" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the Leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> while Labour parliamentarians encouraged and supported progressive measures such as the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]], the [[Mines Act 1908]],<ref>British Economic and Social History 1700\u20131964 by C.P. Hill</ref> the [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908]], and compulsory medical inspections in state schools.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/> In 1906, the Labour Party scored its first ever legislative success in the new Parliament with the passage of a bill put forward by the Labour MP Fred Jowett in the form of the [[Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLabour's influence in the passage of the [[Liberal welfare reforms]] was the result of an informal Labour-Liberal alliance that was established in the run up to the general election of 1906. The Labour and Liberal parties reached agreement to accommodate each other's candidates. The Liberals, who were eager to cut deadweight electoral losses to the Conservatives, arrived at a list of 30 constituencies in which they would \"stand down\", thereby giving the LRC free run against Conservatives in exchange for some sway over LRC campaign planks. Winning 25 out of the 30 seats in question, Labour helped [[H. H. Asquith]]\u2019s government pass Britain\u2019s first national pension law in 1908 and, after extended collaboration in the election of 1910, the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] providing both health and unemployment insurance.<ref>Social Democracy and Welfare Capitalism: A Century of Income Security Politics by Alexander Hicks</ref>\n\n==Early years and the rise of the Labour Party==\nThe Labour Party was emerging from the rapidly growing union movement after 1890. It formed an alliance with the Liberal Party that allowed for cross support in elections, and permitted the emergence of a small labour contingent in Parliament. It was a temporary arrangement until the 1920s, when the Labour Party was strong enough to act on its own, and the Liberals were in an irreversible decline. The causes were subtle social changes in the working class that produced the younger generation that wanted to act independently. Michael Childs argues that the younger generation had reason to prefer Labour over Liberal political styles. Social factors included secularized elementary education (with a lesser role for Dissenting Protestantism); the \"New Unionism\" after 1890 brought unskilled workers into a movement previously dominated by the skilled workers;<ref>G.R. Searle, ''A new England?: peace and war, 1886\u20131918'' (2004), pp 185\u201387.</ref> and new leisure-time activities, especially the music hall and sports, enthralled youth while repelling the older generation of Liberal voters. Childs notes that the 1918 electoral reforms added many young working-class voters, and the passing of older Liberal-oriented age cohorts during the 1920s enabled Labour to supplant the Liberals.<ref>Michael Childs,  \"Labour Grows Up: The Electoral System, Political Generations, and British Politics 1890\u20131929.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 6#2 (1995): 123\u2013144.</ref>\n\nThe [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that Trades Unions in the United Kingdom could no longer donate money to fund the election campaigns and wages of Labour MPs. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the Trade Unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest Trades Unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow Trade Unions to fund Labour MPs once more.\n\nBy 1914, there were about 420 Labour representatives sitting on municipal Councils of various kinds, not including a few County councilors in the mining areas, or a much larger number on Boards of Guardians, Parish Councils, and District Councils. Aside from education, and the feeding and medical inspection and treatment of schoolchildren, the issues which the Labour Party pressed most urgently in local government were the local provision of work for the unemployed, the eight-hour workday, the adoption and enforcement of the Fair Wages Clause in public contracts, and fair wages and conditions for local authority employees. In some areas (particularly Birmingham and Glasgow) there was active pressure in support of municipal housing and [[slum clearance]] schemes, while there was also continued agitation (in relation to the Board of guardians) for improved treatment both of the unemployed and other classes of paupers, particularly the disabled and the aged. House-building, midway between a public health service and a trading enterprise, became one of the main planks in the Labour municipal platform.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===World War I===\nWorld War I marked the break through for the party, as the Liberals declined sharply and Labour moved into second place behind the Conservatives.  Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that \"Labour's ability to make so much of the opportunities offered by the war was due, mainly, the parties basic underlying unity during the conflict.\"  <ref>Andrew Thorpe, ''A History of the British Labour Party'' (3rd ed. 2008)) pp 36\u201359</ref> Before the war the party was officially committed to the antiwar argument that capitalism caused warfare. However, the invasion of Belgium and the surge of pro-war attitudes among the membership of the party led increasingly to support of the war.  [[Ramsay MacDonald]] continued to oppose the war, but he quickly resigned as party leader and was replaced by [[Arthur Henderson]], who was strongly committed to defeating Germany.  In 1915, the Labour Party gained ministerial office for the first time when Henderson was invited to join Asquith's wartime government. Asquith wanted the co-operation of the trade union movement to greatly expand munitions production. Henderson became President of the Board of Education and served as adviser to Asquith on labour issues. Minor positions were given to G. H. Roberts and William Bruce. In December 1916, when Asquith was replaced by [[David Lloyd George]], more Labour leaders were included in more important positions.<ref>Chris Wrigley, ''David Lloyd George and the British labour movement: peace and war'' (1976) ch 1.</ref>  Henderson was promoted to the inner war cabinet, while [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]] of the engineers became Minister of Pensions and [[John Hodge (politician)|John Hodge]] of the steel workers became Minister of Labour. William Bruce, G. H. Roberts, and James Parker (another Labour MP) took minor posts.<ref>Eric Hopkins, ''A Social History of the English Working Classes 1815\u20131945''</ref>\n\nDespite mainstream Labour Party's support for the war effort, the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the Non-Conscription Fellowship while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes. Arthur Henderson resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. Overall, however, the majority of the movement continued to support the war for the duration of the conflict, and the British Labour Party, unlike most of its equivalents on the Continent, did not split over the war.<ref>David Swift, ''For Class and Country: the Patriotic Left and the First World War'' (2017)</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the First World War, while serving both inside and outside of government, the Labour Party was able to influence a number of progressive developments in social policy. At a time when 90% of housing was privately rented, landlords sought to increase rents in the face of rising wartime prices (and in some cases as a means of profiteering). This resulted in a range of largely spontaneous protests in 1915 which were then often co-ordinated by local Labour movements, such as that in Glasgow, where the ILP played a leading role. This forced the government to pass legislation which fixed wartime rents at pre-war levels. This was significant in that it showed labour to be the party that would defend working-class interests in housing, more than its rivals, while also helping Labour to move away from trade union related issues towards areas which had some direct appeal to women, in particular. In addition, as argued by Andrew Thorpe, it also \"added credibility to the idea of state action to control market forces which disadvantaged the working class.\"<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nThe Labour Party also campaigned for \"fair shares,\" attacking profiteering and unrestricted market forces, and secured some advances by applying pressure on the government. The Labour Party pushed hard for high taxation of war profits, rationing, and other controls, and in 1917 with J.R. Clynes at the Food Commission and in 1918 as Controller, price controls were introduced which stabilised food prices, while rationing, which came into operation at the beginning of 1918, ensuring a real degree of \"fair play.\" An excess profits duty was also introduced in 1915 which stood at 80% by 1917, and Labour's credentials were further established by the WEC's \"Conscription of Riches\" campaign, launched in 1916.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tony Judge|title=J.R.

So with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became Prime Minister in January 1924 and formed the first ever Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).\n\nBecause the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals, it was unable to get any arguably socialist legislation passed by the House of Commons. The most significant measure was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]] which began a building programme of 500,000 homes for rent to working-class families.\n\nThe government collapsed after only nine months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the hoaxed [[Zinoviev letter]], which implicated Labour in a plot for a Communist revolution in Britain, and the Conservatives were returned to power, although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% of the popular vote to a third of the popular vote\u2014most of the Conservative gains were at the expense of the Liberals.

However, MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald's government included the first ever woman cabinet minister [[Margaret Bondfield]] who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>A.J.P.

Under the Coal Mines Act 1930, for instance, marketing schemes for output and price regulation were set up, while a commission was appointed to promote schemes of unification. Minimum wages and subsistence allowances were fixed for one year, while measures for miner's safety were increased and improved. The Pensions Act of 1929 granted pensions to over 500,000 children, old people, and widows who had previously been excluded from the pensions system.<ref>The Record of the Second Labour Government, The Labour Publications Dept., Transport House, Smith Square, London, S.W.1., October 1935</ref>\n\n====Great Depression and the split under MacDonald====\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and eventual [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] occurred soon after the government came to power, and the crisis hit Britain hard. By the end of 1930 the unemployment rate had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">A. J. Davies, ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'' (1996)</ref>\n\nThe Labour government struggled to cope with the crisis and found itself attempting to reconcile two contradictory aims; achieving a balanced budget in order to maintain the [[pound sterling|pound]] on the [[Gold Standard]], whilst also trying to maintain assistance to the poor and unemployed. All of this whilst tax revenues were falling. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Philip Snowden]] refused to permit [[deficit spending]].<ref>Taylor, ''English History 1914\u20131945'' (1965) pp 284\u201397.</ref>\n\nOne junior minister, [[Oswald Mosley]], put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the public control of imports and banking as well as an increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and went on to form the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], and later the [[British Union of Fascists]] after he converted to [[Fascism]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mandle | first1 = W.

Under pressure from its Liberal allies as well as the Conservative opposition who feared that the budget was unbalanced, the Labour government appointed a committee headed by Sir [[George May, 1st Baron May|George May]] to review the state of public finances. The [[May Report]] of July 1931 urged public-sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending (notably in payments to the unemployed) in order to avoid a budget deficit.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McKibbin | first1 = Ross | year = 1975 | title = The Economic Policy of the Second Labour Government 1929\u20131931 | journal = Past & Present | volume = 68 | issue = 68| pages = 95\u2013123 | jstor=650274 | doi=10.1093/past/68.1.95}}</ref>\n\nThis proposal proved deeply unpopular within the Labour Party grass roots and the [[trade union]]s, which along with several government ministers, refused to support any such measures. Several senior ministers such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[J. R. Clynes]] threatened to resign rather than agree to the cuts.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> MacDonald, and Philip Snowden however, insisted that the Report's recommendations must be adopted to avoid incurring a budget deficit.\n\nThe dispute over spending and wage cuts split the Labour government; as it turned out, fatally. The cabinet repeatedly failed to agree to make cuts to spending or introduce tariffs. The resulting political deadlock caused investors to take fright, and a flight of capital and gold further de-stabilised the economy. In response, MacDonald, on the urging of the king agreed to form a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], with the Conservatives and the small group of Liberals. On 24 August 1931 MacDonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led a small number of his senior colleagues, most notably Snowden and Dominions Secretary [[James Henry Thomas|J. H. Thomas]], in forming the National Government with the other parties. MacDonald and his supporters were then expelled from the Labour Party and formed [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]].

The ILP embarked on a long drawn out decline. The role of the ILP within the Labour Party was taken up for a time by the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], which operated inside the Labour Party and was led by [[Stafford Cripps]], which attracted several thousand teachers and intellectuals. In 1937 when the Socialist League proposed a [[Popular Front (UK)|Popular Front]] coalition with Communists, the Labour Party closed it down.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pimlott | first1 = Ben | year = 1971 | title = The Socialist League: Intellectuals and the Labour Left in the 1930s | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 12\u201338 | jstor=259876 | doi=10.1177/002200947100600302}}</ref>\n\n===Economics===\nThe Labour Party moved to the [[left-wing politics|left]] during the early 1930s.

Party leader Attlee avoided economics. By contrast, the small surviving Liberal party had elaborate analyses and proposals thanks to its experts such as  [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[William Beveridge]]. When Labour came to power in 1945, it discovered there were no plans on how to conduct nationalisation. No preparation had been made for the shortages in coal that experts had warned was coming.  Attlee and his fellow leaders based their postwar policies on wartime experiences.<ref>Alan Booth, \"How Long are Light Years in British Politics?

Nevertheless, they remained a small weak party in Parliament.\n\n==Local Labour reforms in the inter-war period==\nAlthough Labour remained out of office for most of the inter-war period, it was able to control many local authorities and put its socialist principles into practice on a small scale.\n\n{{quote\n| text = The Labour-controlled local authorities, and also those in which Labour was the strongest single party, had in practice to concentrate mainly on making the most of the opportunities offered to them by national legislation \u2013 especially in the fields of housing, education, public health services, and, after 1929, the services transferred to them from the Boards of Guardians. In all these fields, Labour had a notably good local government record.\n| sign = [[G. D. H. Cole]], ''A History of the Labour Party from 1914''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n}}\nDuring the inter-war period, Labour in local government sought to use the power of municipal authority to improve the working and living environments of its primarily working-class constituents. The functions of local government provided Labour Party members with experience in office, and provided them with the opportunity to improve the living standards of its constituents through measures such as improvements in housing and health care, the provision of maternity clinics, and free milk and meals for schoolchildren.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/> Following the end of [[World War I]], Labour councillors returned in 1919 adopted a policy of municipal socialism (particularly in boroughs of London) to tackle social problems such as poor health, inadequate housing, and general insecurity. Labour in local government sought to establish a \"proto-welfare state\" through, for instance, the elected Boards of Guardians, paying more generous levels of poor relief to the jobless and encouraging the construction of clinics, houses, and municipal baths which, apart from providing necessary services, also provided employment opportunities.<ref name=\"Harmer\"/> Also, although Labour groups often remained in the minority on their respective councils, they and their supporters mounted campaigns to safeguard and extend people's standard of living. For example, minority Labour groups could block council initiatives that they saw as going against the interests of their constituents.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\nDuring the 1920s, Labour councillors forced the pace in local administration, whether in councils or (until their abolition in 1929) on boards of guardians. As noted by [[John Wheatley]], \"One of the brightest results of the growth of the Labour movement is that the control of the poor has been passed on into the hands of popular boards of guardians.\" In general, Labour councillors showed more willingness than others in pressing their legal powers to the limit and less concerned about the cost to the rates, and before the end of the 1930s, 60 local authorities were under the control of the Labour Party.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">The Coming of the Welfare State by Maurice Bruce</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Labour councils made great efforts to protect unemployed people from the worst effects of the slump,<ref>Welfare State and Welfare Change by Martin Powell and Martin Hewitt</ref> and sought to ensure that the public assistance system for the needy was made as generous as possible. In Durham and Glamorgan, the Labour administrations paid more than the minimum, while operating the means test more humanely than they were supposed to.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In Hackney, the London Labour Party secretary Herbert Morrison resorted to charitable methods to counteract the effects of unemployment.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/> In Nelson, the Labour council of the 1930s invested in essential services like education and child welfare.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pendlelabour.com/PDF/TheGazetteMay7_1935.pdf|title=Why we did not Celebrate: A Reasoned Case for Reasonable People.|last=|first=|date=7 May 1935|work=The Gazette|access-date=|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402104816/http://www.pendlelabour.com/PDF/TheGazetteMay7_1935.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Glasgow, Patrick Dollan's Glasgow corporation carried out a slum-clearance programme that resulted in the construction of some 200,000 homes between 1934 and 1939. In Barnsley, the school-leaving age was raised by six months in order to promote education and keep some 500 teenagers off the unemployment figure. In addition, priority was given to housing construction and slum clearances.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\nLabour authorities also sought to humanise the services provided by local authorities, to reduce the harshness of the way in which welfare services operated and to enable working-class people to enjoy the benefits of open space and culture. In Norwich, Labour ensured that school architecture was made bright and modern, while the Labour administration in Glasgow put an end to a controversial system in which elderly couples claiming poor relief could be split up into separate hostel units. In many Labour authorities such as Norwich and West Ham, assistance was given to poor mothers as well as the disabled.\n\nLabour representatives on the Boards of Guardians in the 1920s and on the Public Assistance Committees of the early 1930s sought to offset the effects of unemployment and poverty as best as they could within existing structures. This often led to interventionist measures such as the provision of free school meals or ensuring that benefit claimants received the relief that was owed to them. Labour councils sought to administer the means test in the most favourable terms possible, which involved accepting a higher percentage of applications for transitional benefit than in non-Labour localities and providing the maximum rate of relief available. In Poplar, Bethnal Green, and Stepney, for instance, Labour took positive steps on behalf of its working-class supporters, providing protection, jobs, and relief at a time of economic uncertainty.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\nFemale Labour members played an active role in the policy-making of local labour councils, and the extension of accepted (or expected) municipal responsibility brought politics into areas to which women were the acknowledged experts. As recalled by Hannah Mitchell, when she sat on relief committees she \"knew just how much food could be bought out of the allowance, knew the cost of children\u2019s clothes and footwear, could tell at a glance if an applicant was in ill health.\" Through first-hand knowledge of such issues, women contributed to the implementation of reforms which benefited their constituents, such as the building of wash houses, maternity centres, health clinics, playgrounds, and parks. These reforms not only extended Labour's appeal, but also provided women with \"a distinctive place within Labour and municipal politics.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\n===Wales===\nThe Labour Party also enjoyed a strong following in Wales, where in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] it won 8 out of 35 seats. In regards to social legislation (including health, housing, and education), the Labour-controlled authorities were both progressive in outlook and generous in spending. This meant that, despite extreme poverty, South Wales (where Labour was strong), had better outcomes in health, housing, and education than other parts of Wales, and this despite the poverty of the councils themselves. For instance, Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, and parts of Monmouthshire provided free school meals, while provision of this kind was exceptional in most of North Wales, Wrexham being an exception. A move towards expanding secondary school places to be filled on merit was also far more evident in authorities controlled by the Labour Party. In the most industrialised parts of Wales, Labour-dominated councils successfully tried not only to increase the number of secondary-school places (even during the years of the Great depression), but also worked towards providing these places free, and therefore on merit, instead of on ability to pay. By 1932, over 60% of places were free, a far higher figure than in England.<ref>Modern Wales: a concise history by Gareth Elwyn Jones</ref> In Rhondda, the dominant Labour council introduced progressive measures such as free milk for children from poor households which helped to counteract some of the worst effects of the Great Depression, while in Swansea, a government grant was obtained to finance a number of civic building projects, the means test was exercised relatively humanely and a nursery school was opened.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\">Labour Inside the Gate: A History of the British Labour Party between the Wars by Matthew Worley</ref>\n\n===London county council===\nThe biggest breakthrough for Labour in local government [[1934 London County Council election|came in 1934]], with the capture of the most powerful local authority in Britain, the LCC.

An offensive was carried out against London's slums, with new homes built, repairs carried out, and rents reduced for those moving to new municipal accommodation from slum areas. Spending on welfare services, education and health care was increased from 1934 onwards, with more staff employed in hospitals and enjoying better pay and conditions. More free places in secondary education were offered, improvements made in patient care; new schools were constructed, and more amenities were provided, with the initiation of more milk, playing fields, and health visits. The LCC also made efforts to ensure that reforms were carried out to reduce the harshness of public assistance. Morrison's plans for a \"[[green belt]]\" surrounding London also came to fruition, which provided the relevant local authorities with funds to purchase and maintain land.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\" />\n\nServices were expanded under Morrison, with the initiation of new main drainage schemes, more major highways and bridge improvements, and new headquarters and appliances for the fire brigade. The LCC parks were also developed, with Victoria Park in the East End \"transformed with a wide range of facilities\" and other parks got more baths, bowling greens, athletic grounds, paddling pools, playgrounds, refreshment places, gymnasia, and sun-bathing sections. Amenities were provided for children such as entertainment during school holidays in the form of story-tellers, conjurers, and comedians, specially designed saucer-shaped paddling pools were installed to help parents in spotting their children, and special children's lavatories were built to reduce the chance of indecent assault.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' by Bernard Donoghue and G.W. Jones</ref>\n\nIn housing, more clearance areas and compulsory purchase orders were introduced, and new sites were found for building. Also, as noted by a biography on Morrison, the opposition attacked Morrison \"for the deliberate injection of LCC housing into previous Tory strongholds\". The standard of the houses was improved, with more facilities and bigger sizes, and Morrison's administration also scrapped the Municipal Reform tenement where one bathroom was shared by three families. More capital expenditure was allocated towards the LCC housing programme, new flats and houses were built more quickly, and rents were reduced for tenants coming from the slums, \"who often found the increased rents difficult to bear when they were rehoused\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nMore money was allocated towards public health and welfare services by Morrison's administration. [[Somerville Hastings]] had a great influence over health policy in London and was for many years Chairman of the Public Health Committee, which was dominated by members of the [[Socialist Medical Association]].<ref name=\"Pemberton Books\" /> Hospitals were modernised and re-equipped, and more staff were employed, with improved conditions and pay. Patients also benefited from the installation of wirelesses, improved diets, and the ending of patient contributions for the residential treatment of TB. Mental patients were allowed a fortnight long holiday by the sea, and visitors to hospital inmates could have their fares paid. Services for the blind were also improved, and midwifery services were extended.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> In addition, LCC ambulances were made free for maternity cases.<ref>{{cite journal|title=THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL UNDER A LABOUR ADMINISTRATION, 1934\u20131936. \u2013 2007 \u2013 Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics&nbsp;\u2014 Wiley Online Library|volume=13|pages=122\u2013148|date=2007-03-31|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8292.1937.tb00524.x|issue=1|journal=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics}}</ref>\n\nIn education, new schools were built and old schools rebuilt, and more money was channelled towards their books, furniture, and apparatus. More attention was given to playing fields, and more staff were employed (at improved conditions) to reduce class sizes. More nursery schools were established, and special schools were improved, with more aids for the handicapped. More health inspections and more milk were provided for schoolchildren, and technical and commercial education establishments were further developments. Some \"Tory Shylockisms\", brought about by economy cuts, were abolished: more country scholarships were introduced and prizes were restored, while children in residential schools benefited from an increase in educational visits, in pocket money, and a camp holiday each year. Cadet corps for military training were banned from LCC schools, in conjunction with Morrison's belief, as put by a biography on Morrison, that it was wrong \"to inculcate militaristic values into the young\", and school visits to military displays like the Aldershot tattoo and the Hendon pageant were stopped.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nVarious reforms to public assistance were also carried out under Morrison. As noted by a biography on Morrison, the \"barrack-liked\" mixed workhouses were broken up, and children, the blind, the sick, the old, and expectant mothers were treated separately, \"instead of all together in institutions for paupers.\" Conditions for the receipt of relief were relaxed, and a coal allowance was restored. The administration of public assistance was also reformed, with the investigating committees of councillors and co-opted members (which applicants for relief had to appear before under the Municipal reformers) abolished, and in their place full-time adjudicating officers were to interview applicants and take the decisions. As noted by a biography on Morison, Herbert Morrison, \"wanted to streamline the administration of relief and to help the applicant by having his case dealt with by a professional in privacy.\" During his time in office, Morrison was also responsible for the new Waterloo Bridge, the development of the south bank, and comprehensive town planning.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n===Poplar council===\nOne Labour council that acquired great notoriety during the inter-war period was that of Poplar, where the Labour councillors introduced a wide range of reforms including [[equal pay for women]], the introduction of a minimum wage for municipal workers, and improved municipal services and welfare programmes.<ref name=\"Rose 1990\">{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Gillian |authorlink=Gillian Rose (geographer) |title=Imagining Poplar in the 1920s: Contested concepts of community |journal=[[Journal of Historical Geography]] |date=October 1990 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=425\u2013437 |doi=10.1016/0305-7488(90)90144-Z}}</ref> Dedicated to improving the lives of poor working-class people, the Labour Poor Law Guardians paid generous scales of relief to the poor that led them to fall into debt.

In 1921, for instance, Poplar had a rateable value of \u00a34m and 86,500 unemployed persons to support, while other, richer councils could call on a rateable value of \u00a315 to support only 4,800 unemployed. George Lansbury, the new mayor of Poplar, proposed that the Council stop collecting the rates for outside, cross-London bodies. This was agreed and on 31 March 1921, Poplar Council set a rate of 4s 4d instead of 6s 10d.\n\nDespite their imprisonment, the Labour Guardians refused to give way, and were released six weeks after they were imprisoned.<ref name=\"Wood\"/> In addition, the actions of the Poplar councillors in demanding that the burden of the rates be shared more equitably between poorer and richer boroughs led to the passage of legislation which provided for the greater equality between boroughs that they had demanded.<ref name=\"Harmer\"/> Poplar no longer had to carry an unduly heavy burden as all London areas now shared the costs of poor relief in the future. Poplar continued to provide relatively generous scales of relief, paying \u00a32 19s 6d to a family of seven instead of the agreed London rate of \u00a32 14s.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Labour councils not only brought relief to the poorest sections of the community, they provided opportunities for employment and, through the funding of education and library facilities, self-improvement.\n |source = {{dash}}''Labour Inside the Gate: A History of the British Labour Party between the Wars'' by Matthew Worley\n |width  = 50%\n |align  = right\n}}\nLabour councils also endeavoured to present themselves as model employers. By the Thirties, for instance, most Labour councils had set up municipal works departments, carrying out repair work and construction without having to use a private contractor. Labour council employees also tended to be paid at (or above) trade union wage rates and were subject to union-recognised conditions. In Poplar, the Labour council that was elected in 1919 immediately agreed to, and increased, a minimum wage for all employees. Labour councils sought to employ direct labour to embark on their municipal building schemes, such as in Wigan, where people who were employed to build the town's municipal houses were subject to trade union pay, conditions, and holidays.\n\n==Wartime coalition==\n[[File:Labour Party membership graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A graph showing Labour Party individual membership which showcase a large increase in membership after the war]]\nThe party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Coalition Government|wartime coalition]]. When [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned in the spring of 1940, incoming-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] decided to bring the other main parties into a coalition similar to that of the First World War. Clement Attlee was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]] and a member of the war cabinet, eventually becoming the United Kingdom's first [[Deputy Prime Minister]].\n\nThe aggressive trade union leader Ernest Bevin, as [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], directed Britain's allocation of manpower, [[Herbert Morrison]] became [[Home Secretary]], [[Hugh Dalton]] was [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] and later [[President of the Board of Trade]], while [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A. V. Alexander]] resumed the role he had held in the previous Labour Government as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Labour also filled eight junior posts, a number which rose to seventeen by 1945.<ref name=\"Pugh\" /> According to [[G. D. H. Cole]], the basis of the Wartime Coalition was that the labour ministers would look after the [[Home Front]] (including the maintenance of important social services and the mobilisation of manpower). Although the Exchequer remained in the hands of the Conservatives, a firm understanding was made with Labour regarding the equitable distribution of tax burdens.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWhile serving in coalition with the Conservatives, the Labour members of Churchill's cabinet were able to put their ideals into practice, implementing a wide range of progressive social and economic reforms which did much to improve the living standards and working conditions of working-class Britons. According to [[Maurice Bruce]], \"for their influence on the shaping of events this might almost be called the third, as it was certainly the most constructive to date, of Britain's labour governments.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAs observed by [[Kenneth O.

Labour also pressed hard for better provisions for the victims of air warfare, for more and better civic and industrial restaurants and canteens, and for war-time nurseries for the children of female workers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''A History of the Labour Party from 1914'' by G. D. H. Cole</ref>\n\nIn a manifesto on \"The Peace\", adopted by the 1941 Labour Party Annual Conference, it was claimed that Labour's participation in the Wartime coalition Government had been effective in that, a year after Labour had joined the government,  the war was now being fought not only with much greater efficiency, but with a higher regard for social equity as well:\n\n{{quote|The area of the social services has been increased.  Largely through the care and determination of the Trade unions, the standard of life has been well safeguarded. The health of the workers has been protected by the maintenance of the factory codes, and by the institution of factory doctors, canteens, and nurseries. Labour, national and local, has taken its share in civil defence; and in every sphere its activities have done much to improve the provision for the safety and comfort of citizens. The social protection of our people has been facilitated by the alert and continuous watch which has been kept over financial policy. Interest rates have been kept down. The Treasury has assumed powers over the Banks which assure their full co-operation in the policy upon which Parliament decides. The dangers of inflation, ever present in war-time, have been kept to a minimum.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />}}\n\nAccording to the historian [[G. D. H. Cole]], Labour's claims were arguably justified: profiteering was kept down, and there was greater equity both in the allocation of supplies and in taxation. In addition, social services were not merely kept up, but also expanded to meet wartime needs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Tom Johnston (British politician)|Tom Johnston]] used his position as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] to push through a range of important developmental initiatives, such as the development of hydroelectricity in the Highlands, while Hugh Dalton's regional policies directly assisted some of the Labour Party's strongest cores of support.<ref>A History of the Labour Party by Andrew Thorpe</ref> The Distribution of Industry Act 1945, pushed through by Hugh Dalton before the end of the wartime coalition, launched a vigorous policy of regenerating \"depressed areas\" such as industrial Scotland, the North-East of England, Cumbria, and South Wales, while diversifying the economic base of these regions. This foundation of this vigorous regional policy were actually laid during the Second World War, with the extension of the role of the trading estates and the linking of the industrial base of areas like the Welsh mining areas with the operations of government ordinance and armaments plants.<ref name=\"Morgan\" /> [[James Chuter Ede]], a Labour politician who served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, worked together with the conservative politician [[Rab Butler]] in drafting the [[1944 Education Act]],<ref>A Century of Change: 1837-Today by R.J. Unstead</ref> while also playing a major role in its passage.<ref>The making of the 1944 Education Act by Michael Barber</ref>\n\nLabour's influence on wartime policy was also evident in the first general statement of peace aims, the Atlantic Charter of August 1941. This included a reference to \"improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security\" which had been inserted by the War Cabinet into a draft prepared by Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill and had actually been insisted on by Bevin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAt the end of 1940, Arthur Greenwood was given the task of planning, in Churchill's words, \"a number of practical steps which it is indispensable to take if our society is to move forward.\" In June 1941, in response to arguments by the Trades Union Congress that there existed inadequacies with the country's system of social insurance, Greenwood set up an Interdepartmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services to look into the state of Britain's social welfare programmes, and see where improvements may be made. Greenwood appointed a Liberal, William Beveridge, chairman of the committee.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nCo-operators, in common with the trade unions and labour, pressed hard from the outset of the war for the extension of the food rationing system to cover all essential supplies, arguing that the existence of an unrationed sector would create class injustices and result in time wasted on seeking supplies from shop to shop. Labour responded to Co-operative demands on these issues in March 1941 by establishing a Food Deputation Committee to work for more effective control and rationing of food supplies, together with the creation of an effective Consumers\u2019 Council.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nIn the field of workmen's compensation, Labour succeeded in getting what Labour saw as an unsatisfactory bill withdrawn, and a new Bill introduced \"to include single persons and to give improved allowances.\" The new Workmen's Compensation (Supplementary Allowances) Act, which came into effect in August 1940), provided a supplementary allowance not exceeding 5s a week to all disabled workers, together with a supplementary allowance of 4s a week each for the first and second child, and 3s for each other child younger than 15. For a man with 3 children, the improvement represented 16s a week. For agricultural workers, a bill increasing the maximum unemployment benefit for agricultural workers by 3s a week was amended by Ernest Bevin, with a more generous increase of 6s a week introduced.<ref>\"Labour in the Government: A Record of Social Legislation in War Time Published\" by the Labour Party, Transport House, Smith Square, S.W.1, May 1941</ref>\n\nA number of reforms were also carried out under the auspices of cabinet member Herbert Morrison. In the area of Civil Defence, rescue services were provided with new methods and new tackle, schools were established to teach rescue men new and safer ways of performing their jobs, and great emphasis was placed on increased training. As noted by a pamphlet documenting Morrison's war work, \"From the local week-end school to the NN.F.S. College and the Civil Defence Staff College he insisted on the necessity of adequate training of both officers and men.\" Morrison is also noted to have worked hard for increases in pay and allowances for Civil Defence and War Reserve police, and in the end flat gratuities were authorised for whole-timers \"who had done such a fine job in the blitz.\" A National Fire Service was also set up under Morrison,<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\">Herbert Morrison\u2019s work in the War Government 1940\u20131945 Published by The Labour Party</ref> which led to improved working conditions such as a reduced working week and higher rates of pay.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F2eGsZBa14UC&pg=PA128&dq=herbert+morrison+wages+conditions+fire+service#v=onepage&q=herbert%20morrison%20wages%20conditions%20fire%20service&f=false|title=Bath Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service, 1891 to 1974: An Illustrated History&nbsp;\u2014 Dennis Hill&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=128|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=978-0-948975-69-1|author1=Hill|first1=Dennis|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of penal administration, Morrison discontinued hard labour, while various measures designed to tackle child problems (such as juvenile wrongdoing) were carried out. The re-war accommodation in Remand Homes was doubled by the addition of 1,000 places, while 3,000 additional places were provided in Approved Schools. In Approved Schools, appointed Welfare Officers were introduced to maintain contact with the boys and girls as they left the schools, while the \"classifying schools\" reform was carried out to ensure that the Approved Schools to which boys and girls were sent to ones which were suited to their needs. A committee was also established by Morrison (in consultation with the Ministers and Education and Health) to inquire into the question of provision made for the care of children deprived of normal home life, while the inspectorate was increased in order that additional attention could be given to Remand Homes and voluntary homes. In addition, a Departmental Committee was established to review \"the question of the salaries and conditions of employment of staff employed both in Approved Schools and in Remand Homes.\" In addition, under a decision announced by the Home Office and the Scottish Office in March 1943, the provision of the Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act of 1939 (which had been postponed due to the outbreak of the war) was brought into operation, forbidding \"any body of persons, other than a local authority or registered adoption society, to make arrangements for the adoption of a child.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nIn terms of the police and probation services, efforts were undertaken to continue the expansion (in spite of an acute shortage of experienced workers) of the Probation Service during the years of the war. Improvements were made in the salaries and conditions of service (with an aim of drawing suitable men and women on their release from the Forces and Civil Defence and industry, while the Probation Training Board was reconstituted to provide better facilities for selection, training, and experience. The Police and Firemen (War Service) Act preserved the rights of constables in the armed forces, while a Defence Regulation was introduced to preserve the constables who had left the service to go into war work. The Police (Appeals) Act of 1943 made it possible(for the first time) for policemen who had suffered reductions in pay or rank to appeal to the Home Secretary, while whole-time auxiliary police were provided with the same rights of appeal against reduction in rank or dismissal. The Auxiliary Police Association was set up to enable the Police War Reserve \"to bring to the notice of the Home Secretary matters relating to welfare and efficiency,\" while the employment of women (both as constables and as auxiliaries) was significantly extended to tackle war-time problems.<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nIn regards to workmen's compensation, various measures were introduced by Morrison to improve provisions for injured workers, meeting the requests of the miners for the inclusion of pneumoconiosis and the cotton trade unions for the inclusion of byssinosis within the scope of the Compensation Acts. A long-standing issue was the case of long-standing injury in which a man was compensated under the old Acts, and at a very different standard of wages than had ruled in his industry since. Morrison tackled this problem by carrying an Act through Parliament in 1943 that helped such cases \"by providing that pre-accident earnings were to be reviewed, if and when a change occurs, after the date of the accident, in the rate of remuneration in the class of employment in which the injured man had been employed.\" This applied dating as far back as 1924, and many long standing cases had thus derived \"substantial benefits resulting from war-time increases the rates of pay of their trade.\" By this means, partial disability cases were significantly safeguarded from a reduction in compensation when rises in wage rates were given in their pre-injury employment. The Act also included a provision enabling the Court \"in deciding dependency to disregard the earnings of the widow from work to which she had been directed, or which she had taken up during the war,\" thereby safeguarding widows whose work could end with the war, and who \"might then be dependent on compensation for her late husband\u2019s accident.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nIn 1941, the annual limit for non-manual workers under the Compensation Acts was increased from \u00a3350 to \u00a3420, while a further Act in 1943 raised the allowances for injured men and their children, and provided (for the first time) an allowance for wives. The maximum allowances for adult dependants of workmen killed by accidents was also increased, together with the total sum payable where adults and children were left. In addition, under Morrison, the Welsh language could now be used \"in any Court in Wales by any person whose natural language is Welsh,\" while the long-standing problem of the Welsh Church burial grounds was finally sorted out. To promote opportunities for women, a female Deputy Regional Commissioner, a Home Office Police Staff Officer, and a Stipendiary Magistrate were appointed for the first time under Morrison's recommendations.<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nThe [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], [[Ernest Bevin]] did much to improve working conditions, raising the wages of the lowest paid male workers, such as miners, railwaymen, and agricultural labourers, while also persuading and forcing employers, under threat of removal of their Essential Works Order, to improve company medical and welfare provision, together with sanitary and safety provisions.  This was important both for improving working conditions and for cementing worker consent to the war effort, and as a result of Bevin's efforts, doctors, nurses, and welfare officers multiplied on the shop floor while there was a threefold increase in the provision of works canteens. Almost 5,000 canteens were directly created by Bevin in controlled establishments, while a further 6,800 were set up by private employers by 1944. During the course of the war, the number of works doctors increased from 60 to about 1,000. This provision, however, was much more extensive within larger factories, with smaller employers continuing \"to barely comply with the minimum provision of a first aid box.\" Accident rates did, however, decline after 1942.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nUnder the Essential Work Orders, provision was made for such initiatives as guaranteed employment, the payment of proper wages, the honouring of wage agreements, and proper welfare facilities for workers.Bevin also encouraged the Minister of Food, W.S. Morrison, to develop communal feeding (especially in factories), resulting in provisions for communal feeding being extended throughout the country. As part of his Welfare Scheme, Bevin introduced various forms of entertainment in the factories, including mid-day canteen concerts. Nurseries were also set up for the children of working mothers by the Ministry of Health (under the recommendation of the Ministry of Labour). For workers who found it hard to get their shopping due to circumstances such as blackouts, special shopping facilities were set up to get around this problem. National standards were also introduced providing proper welfare and wages and conditions for the domestic staff of hospitals and institutions.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Ernest Bevin\u2019s Work in Wartime 1940\u20131945 Published by the Labour Party, Printed by the Victoria House Printing Co., Ltd.

Steps were also taken to ensure that adequate training was provided to the fighting forces and also to repair disabled ships. For seamen, upon taking office, Bevin inaugurated the Seamen's Welfare Convention and hours of labour were introduced equal to those proposed in the Convention. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for miners, including a Medical Service, a Guaranteed Week, a National Minimum Wage, and a National Board. Various laws were also passed under Bevin to help people return to their jobs or trades. The Re-instatement in Civil Employment Act gave the right of re-instatement to all those who had jobs \"whether they had volunteered for Service, were called up as Territorials, or were conscripted,\" while the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme covered those who had been learning their trade prior to their service, which also included people who had been training for promotion and for a career.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\nA bill was introduced by Bevin increased unemployment benefits and extended unemployment insurance coverage to non-manual workers earnings earning up to \u00a3420. National Health Insurance benefits were also increased, while the income level was increased to the same level. In addition, a further Bill raised Supplementary Old Age Pensions and Unemployment Assistance. New Orders were also made governing Industrial Diseases, \"both extending and improving welfare and medical services in these fields,\" while in the field of industrial relations Bevin assisted in the creation of 43 new Joint Industrial Councils. A system of resettlement grants was also established to help ex-Service men and women to either start or restart a business.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\nThe Second World War also saw significant improvements in the position of trade unions, which were encouraged by Bevin. Trade unions were integrated into joint consultation at all levels of government and industry, with the TUC drawn in to represent labour on the National Joint Advisory Council (1939) and the joint Consultative Committee (1940). A similar status was bestowed upon employers\u2019 organisations, which led Middlemass to argue that capital and organised labour had become \"governing institutions\" within a tripartite industrial relations system \"with the state at the fulcrum.\" The elevation of the status of organised labour to one of parity with capital in Whitehall was effectively summed up by Bevin's biographer as such:\n\n{{quote|The organised working class represented by the trade unions was for the first time brought into a position of partnership in the national enterprise of war \u2013 a partnership on equal not inferior terms, as in the First World War.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />}}\n\nCollective bargaining was further extended by Bevin, who radically extended both the Wages Boards (the renamed Trades Boards) and the Whitley Committees, 46 of the latter were formed during the Second World War, and by the end of the war 15.5 million workers were covered by the minimum wage provisions by the Wages Boards. On the shop floor, Bevin directly encouraged the formation of joint production committees to extend worker's participation in industry. By June 1944, almost 4,500 such committees were in existence, covering 3.5 million workers. By the end of the war, the joint production committees were intervening in areas once considered to be the sacrosanct domain of employers, such as health, welfare, transfers of labour, machine staffing, technology, piece rate fixing, and wage payment systems. These developments brought about significant improvements to conditions in the workplace, with a [[Mass-Observation]] survey carried out in 1942 noting that \"the quick sack and the unexplained instability\" of the 1930s had practically vanished. During the 1940s, significant improvements in occupational health and safety standards were brought about both by the rising bargaining power of workers within the older \"staple\" sectors of the economy and the rise of \"the pro-active wartime and post-war state.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nAlso in the 1940s, trade union power and authority was extended further than in British history up until that point, with labour's ability to regulate and control work significantly enhanced during this period. This was assisted by developments such as full employment, the growth of union membership, rising from 32% to 45% of the workforce from 1939 to 1950 and increasing workplace representation, as characterised by the large increase in the number of shop stewards. The progressive social changes were continued in the initial post-war period, with the creation of the Welfare State (which placed a floor under wages) and the extension of the legal rights of unions through the repeal of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act (1927) in 1946, while the 1948 Industrial Injuries Act provided compensation for accidents in the workplace.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nThe war years also witnessed a significant extension of collective bargaining, which was directly encouraged by Bevin. By 1950, between nine and ten million workers were covered by collective voluntary bargaining. Bevin also established 46 new Joint Industrial Councils and extended the coverage of the Wages Boards between 1943 and 1945. By 1950, as a result of these changes, virtually all of the poorly organised and low-paid categories of workers were subject to state sponsored wage regulation and collective bargaining. This transformation in worker's protection and bargaining power had the definitive effect of reducing long-established local and regional wage differences.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nBevin was also responsible for the passage of the Determination of Needs Act in 1941, which finally abolished the long-detested household means test.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> After the passage of the Determination of Needs Act, the Labour Movement continued to press for improvements, particularly for the extension of the principles of the new legislation to cover Public Assistance and other services as well (at that time, it only covered the Assistance Board). In 1943, this was achieved by further legislation, which also improved conditions relating to supplementary pensions. Throughout the war period, the Labour movement (both in and out of Parliament) pressed successfully for a number of changes liberalising the administration of the social services.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe Catering Wages Act (1943), another initiative by Bevin, established a Catering Wages Commission to oversee wages and working conditions in restaurants and hotels. Inspectors were also appointed to ensure that employers complied with Bevin's insistence on the provision of canteens, welfare officers, and personnel officers in factories.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Bevin also did much to improve conditions for those with disabilities, of which little had been done for before the outbreak of the war. In 1941, Bevin introduced an interim retraining scheme, which was followed by the interdepartmental Tomlinson Committee of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the Disabled. According to the historian [[Pat Thane]], the Committee served as \"a mouthpiece for Bevin's own aspirations,\" and its proposals for improving the lives of the disabled culminated in the [[Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944]].<ref>''The Foundations of the Welfare State'' by Pat Thane</ref>\n\nBevin and the other Labour ministers were also able to ensure that, compared with the First World War, there was greater equality of sacrifice within society. Profiteering was effectively controlled, while rent controls and food subsidies helped to keep down wartime inflation. Wartime wages were allowed to increase in line with, and earnings to surpass, the rate of price inflation, while the tax system became more progressive, with taxation becoming heavier on the very rich (this movement towards greater progressivity was maintained under the Attlee government, with the top rate of income tax reaching 98% in 1949). These policies led to a narrowing of wealth inequalities, with the real value of wage incomes increasing by some 18% between 1938 and 1947, while the real value of property income fell by 15% and salaries by some 21% over that same period.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''A History of Work in Britain, 1880\u20131950'' by Arthur McIvor</ref>\n\n==Post-War victory under Clement Attlee==\n[[File:Clement Attlee.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clement Attlee]], Labour Prime Minister (1945\u20131951)]]\n\nWith the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Labour resolved not to repeat the Liberals' error of 1918, and withdrew from the government to contest the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] (5 July) in opposition to Churchill's Conservatives. Surprising many observers, Labour won a landslide victory, winning just under 50% of the vote with a majority of 145 seats.\nThe exact reasons for the victory are still debated. During the war, public opinion surveys showed public opinion moving to the [[left wing|left]] and in favour of radical social reform.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/> There was little public appetite for a return to the poverty and mass unemployment of the inter-war years which had become associated with the Conservatives.\n\nFrancis (1995) argues there was consensus both in the Labour's national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement. The Attlee government was committed to rebuilding British society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. Labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Party's defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Francis | first1 = Martin | year = 1995 | title = Economics and Ethics: The Nature of Labour's Socialism, 1945\u20131951 | url = | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 220\u2013243 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/6.2.220}}</ref>\n\n[[Attlee ministry|Attlee's government]] proved itself to be one of the most radical British governments of the 20th century, implementing the economic theories of Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], presiding over a policy of nationalising major industries and utilities including the [[Bank of England]], coal mining, the steel industry, electricity, gas, telephones and inland transport including railways, road haulage and canals. It developed and implemented the \"cradle to grave\" [[welfare state]] conceived by the Liberal economist [[William Beveridge]]. To this day the party considers the 1948 creation of Britain's publicly funded [[National Health Service]] under health minister [[Aneurin Bevan]] its proudest achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.org.uk/proud/proud_to_be_labour|title=Proud of the NHS at 60|work=labour.org.uk|publisher=Labour Party|accessdate=15 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414173335/http://www.labour.org.uk/proud/proud_to_be_labour|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Attlee's government also began the process of dismantling the [[British Empire]] when it granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) the following year. At a secret meeting in January 1947, Attlee and six cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]], decided to proceed with the development of Britain's [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapons programme]],<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/> in opposition to the pacifist and anti-nuclear stances of a large element inside the Labour Party.\n\nLabour won the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] but with a much reduced majority of five seats. Soon after the 1950 election, things started to go badly wrong for the Labour government. Defence became one of the divisive issues for Labour itself, especially defence spending (which reached 14% of GDP in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]<ref>Clark, Sir George, ''Illustrated History Of Great Britain'', (1987) Octopus Books</ref>). These costs put enormous strain on public finances, forcing savings to be found elsewhere. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Hugh Gaitskell]] introduced [[prescription charges]] for NHS dentures and spectacles, causing Bevan, along with [[Harold Wilson]] ([[President of the Board of Trade]]) to resign over the dilution of the principle of free treatment.\n\nSoon after this, another election was called. Labour narrowly lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|October 1951 election]] to the Conservatives, despite their receiving a larger share of the popular vote and, in fact, their highest vote ever numerically.\n\nMost of the changes introduced by the 1945\u201351 Labour government however were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the \"[[post war consensus]]\", which lasted until the 1970s.\n\n==\"Thirteen Wasted Years\"==\nFollowing the defeat in 1951, the party became split over the future direction of socialism. The \"[[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellite]]\" right of the party led by [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and associated with thinkers such as [[Anthony Crosland]] wanted the party to adopt a moderate [[Social Democracy|social democratic]] position whereas the \"[[Bevanism|Bevanite]]\" left led by [[Aneurin Bevan]] wanted the party to adopt a more radical socialist position. This split, and the fact that the 1950s saw economic recovery and general public contentment with the Conservative governments of the time, helped keep the party out of power for thirteen years.\n\nAfter being defeated at the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], Attlee resigned as leader and was replaced by Gaitskell. The trade union [[Voting block|block vote]], which generally voted with the leadership, ensured that the Bevanites were eventually defeated.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\nIn the decade following the Second World War, Labour councils played an important part in the housing reconstruction that followed the end of the conflict, and stood as important players in the reconstruction of housing and city centres. In [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], under the leadership of the visionary but corrupt [[T. Dan Smith]], an accelerated \"modernisation\" of the city took place, as characterised by an ambitious programme of road construction and public building and the replacement of slum terraces with new innovative estates such as the Byker \"wall.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe three key divisive issues that were to split the Labour party in successive decades emerged first during this period; [[nuclear disarmament]], the famous [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution, which called for the ultimate nationalisation of all means of production in the British economy, and Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). Tensions between the two opposing sides were exacerbated after Attlee resigned as leader in 1955 and Gaitskell defeated Bevan in the leadership election that followed. The party was briefly revived and unified during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. The Conservative party was badly damaged by the incident while Labour was rejuvenated by its opposition to the policy of prime minister [[Anthony Eden]]. But Eden was replaced by [[Harold Macmillan]], while the economy continued to improve.\n\nIn the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 election]] the Conservatives fought under the slogan \"Life is better with the Conservatives, don't let Labour ruin it\" and the result saw the government majority increase. Following the election bitter internecine disputes resumed. Gaitskell blamed the Left for the defeat and attempted unsuccessfully to amend Clause IV. At a hostile party conference in 1960 he failed to prevent a vote adopting unilateral nuclear disarmament as a party policy, declaring in response that he would \"fight, fight and fight again to save the party I love\". The decision was reversed the following year, but it remained a divisive issue, and many in the left continued to call for a change of leadership.\n\nWhen the Conservative government attempted to take Britain into the EEC in 1962, Gaitskell alienated some of his supporters by his opposition to British membership. In a speech to the party conference in October 1962 Gaitskell claimed that EEC membership would mean \"the end of Britain as an independent European state. I make no apology for repeating it. It means the end of a thousand years of history\".\n\nLabour revisionism turned out to be a powerful ideological tendency within the Party in the 1950s and 1960s, taking intellectual sustenance from [[Anthony Crosland]]'s book, ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) and political leadership from [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. Its important intellectuals included  [[Douglas Jay]], [[Roy Jenkins]], and the writers who contributed to ''Socialist Commentary.'' The goal was to reformulate old socialist principles, and bring the Labour Party policies up to date with the changing British society and economy. Revisionism rejected the old view that socialism ought to be primarily identified with the ownership of the means of production.  That meant that continuous nationalization was not a central goal. Second, was a series of political values focused on personal liberty, social welfare, and equality. Themes of destroying or overthrowing the rich and elite were downplayed in favor of government policies of taxation, widespread educational opportunity, and expanded social services. Revisionists insisted on me the necessity of a market-oriented mixed economy with a central role for capitalism and entrepreneurship.<ref>Stephen Haseler, ''The Gaitskellites: Revisionism in the British Labour Party 1951\u201364'' (Springer, 1969).</ref><ref>F.M. Leventhal, ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Peter Lang, 2002) pp 435\u20136.</ref>\n\nGaitskell died suddenly in January 1963 from a rare disease. His death made way for [[Harold Wilson]] to lead the party. The term \"thirteen wasted years\" was coined by Wilson as a slogan for the 1964 general election, in reference to what he claimed were thirteen wasted years of Conservative government.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\n==Labour Party under Harold Wilson==\n[[File:Harold Wilson (1967).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harold Wilson]], Labour Prime Minister (1964\u20131970 and 1974\u20131976)]]\nA downturn in the economy, along with a series of scandals in the early 1960s (the most notorious being the [[Profumo affair]]), engulfed the Conservative government by 1963. The Labour party returned to government with a wafer-thin 4 seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], and increased their majority to 96 in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]] remaining in power until the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 election]] which, contrary to expectations during the campaign, they lost.\n\n===Economic policies===\nThe 1960s Labour government had a different emphasis from its 1940s predecessor. [[Harold Wilson]]  put faith in [[economic planning]] as a way to solve Britain's economic problems. Wilson famously referred to the \"white heat of technology\", referring to the modernisation of British industry. This was to be achieved through the swift adoption of new technology, aided by government-funded infrastructure improvements and the creation of large high-tech public sector corporations guided by a Ministry of Technology. Economic planning through the new [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]] was to improve the [[trade balance]],<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> whilst Labour carefully targeted taxation aimed at \"luxury\" goods and services.\n\nIn practice however, Labour had difficulty managing the economy under the \"Keynesian consensus\" and the international markets rallied against the party. Events derailed much of the initial optimism. Upon coming to power, the government was informed that the [[trade deficit]] was far worse than expected.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> This soon led to a [[currency crisis]]; despite enormous efforts to shore up the value of sterling, in November 1967 the government was forced into [[devaluation]] of the pound from $2.80 to $2.40,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> which damaged the government's popularity to some extent.\n\nFor much of the remaining Parliament the government followed stricter controls in public spending and the necessary austerity measures caused consternation amongst the Party membership and the trade unions.\n\nIn the event, the devaluation, and austerity measures successfully restored the balance of payments into a surplus by 1969. However, they unexpectedly turned into a small deficit again in 1970. The bad figures were announced just before polling in the 1970 general election, and are often cited as one of the reasons for Labour's defeat.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nAs a gesture towards Labour's more left-wing supporters, Wilson's government renationalised the steel industry in 1967 (which had been denationalised by the Conservatives in the 1950s) creating [[British Steel Corporation]].\n\n===Social and educational reforms===\nThe 1964\u20131970 Labour government carried out a broad range of reforms during its time in office, in such areas as social security,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmsocsec/56/9112407.htm|title=House of Commons&nbsp;\u2014 Social Security&nbsp;\u2014 Minutes of Evidence|work=Publications.parliament.uk|date=1999-12-13|accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/6490/1/The_Evolution_of_Disability_Benefits_in_the_UK_Re-weighting_the_basket.pdf|title=The Evolution of Disability Benefits in the UK Re-weighting the basket|work=eprints.lse.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_F8uAAAAMAAJ&q=united+kingdom+A+new+flat-rate+allowance+of+%C2%A33+a+week+for+the+exceptionally+severely+disabled+was+introduced+in+March,+1966.+From+July,+1966,+the+temporary&dq=united+kingdom+A+new+flat-rate+allowance+of+%C2%A33+a+week+for+the+exceptionally+severely+disabled+was+introduced+in+March,+1966.+From+July,+1966,+the+temporary|title=Report of the Annual Conference&nbsp;\u2014 Labour Party (Great Britain) \u2013 Google Books|last=Labour Party (Great Britain)|date=2007-03-19|publisher=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qkYbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA259&lpg=PA259&dq=harold+wilson+earnings-related+benefits#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20earnings-related%20benefits&f=false|title=The Passionate Economist&nbsp;\u2014 Sally Sheard&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=259|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=9781447314844|author1=Sheard|first1=Sally|year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPxUfFcpxq4C&pg=PA38&dq=Labour+government+earnings-related+benefits+industrial+injuries#v=onepage&q=Labour%20government%20earnings-related%20benefits%20industrial%20injuries&f=false|title=Social Security: Beveridge and After&nbsp;\u2014 Victor George&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=38|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=9780415177238|author1=George|first1=Victor|date=January 2003}}</ref> civil liberties,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JbTbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA489&dq=labour+government+1967+family+planning#v=onepage&q=labour%20government%201967%20family%20planning&f=false|title=British Political History, 1867\u20132001: Democracy and Decline&nbsp;\u2014 Malcolm Pearce, Geoffrey Stewart&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=489|date=2013-09-13|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=9781136453533|author1=Pearce|first1=Malcolm|last2=Stewart|first2=Geoffrey}}</ref> housing,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pfp_sdl12MsC&pg=PA75&dq=harold+wilson+rent+act+1965#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20rent%20act%201965&f=false|title=Directions in Housing Policy: Towards Sustainable Housing Policies for the UK&nbsp;\u2014 A.

Notable amongst these was the partial decriminialisation of male [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]], reform of [[divorce]] laws, the abolition of theatre [[censorship]] and [[capital punishment]] (except for a small number of offences&nbsp;\u2014 notably [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]]) and various legislation addressing [[race relations]] and [[racial discrimination]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nIn Wilson's defence, his supporters also emphasise the easing of [[means testing]] for non-contributory welfare benefits, the linking of pensions to earnings, and the provision of industrial-injury benefits. Wilson's government also made significant reforms to [[education in the United Kingdom|education]], most notably the expansion of [[comprehensive education]] and the creation of the [[Open University]].\n\nIn spite of the economic difficulties faced by Wilson's government, it was therefore able to achieve important advances in a number of domestic policy areas. As reflected by Harold Wilson in 1971,\n\n{{quote|It was a government which faced disappointment after disappointment and none greater than the economic restraints in our ability to carry through the social revolution to which we were committed at the speed we would have wished.

The White Paper was championed by Wilson and [[Barbara Castle]]. The proposals however faced stiff opposition from the [[Trades Union Congress]], and some key cabinet ministers such as [[James Callaghan]].\n\nThe opponents won the day and the proposals were shelved. This episode proved politically damaging for Wilson, whose approval ratings fell to 26%; the lowest for any Prime Minister since polling began.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nIn hindsight, many have argued that the failure of the unions to adopt the proposals of ''In Place of Strife'', led to the far more drastic curbs on trade union power under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\n==1970s==\nIn the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservatives narrowly defeated Harold Wilson's government reflecting some disillusionment amongst many who had voted Labour in 1966.

Heath's government also faced the 1974 miners strike which forced the government to adopt a \"[[Three-Day Week]]\".

The left of the party under [[Tony Benn]] and [[Michael Foot]] became increasingly influential during the early 1970s<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tnvHk8g1crUC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=%22labour's+programme+1973%22 |title=Remaking the Labour Party: From Gaitskell to Blair By Tudor Jones |accessdate=2012-09-08|isbn=9780415125499 |last1=Jones |first1=Tudor |year=1996 }}</ref>\n\nThe left drew up a radical programme; ''Labour's Programme 1973'', which pledged to bring about a \"fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families\". This programme referred to a \"far reaching [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] between workers and the Government\" and called for a major extension of public ownership and state planning. The programme was accepted by that year's party conference. Wilson publicly accepted many of the policies of the Programme with some reservations, but the condition of the economy allowed little room for manoeuvre. In practice many of the proposals of the programme were heavily watered down when Labour returned to government.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\n===Return to power in 1974===\nLabour returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with Ulster Unionist support. The Conservatives were unable to form a government as they had fewer seats, even though they had received more votes. It was the first General Election since 1924 in which both main parties received less than 40% of the popular vote, and was the first of six successive General Elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid for Labour to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, scraped a majority of three, gaining just 18 seats and taking their total to 319.\n\n====European referendum====\nBritain had entered the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1973 while [[Edward Heath]] was Prime Minister. Although Harold Wilson and the Labour party had opposed this, in government Wilson switched to backing membership, but was defeated in a special one day Labour conference on the issue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503155.stm|title=26 April 1975: Labour votes to leave the EEC |accessdate=2007-06-25 | work=BBC News | date=1975-04-26}}</ref> leading to a national referendum on which the yes and no campaigns were both cross-party \u2013 [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|the referendum]] voted in 1975 to continue Britain's membership by two thirds to one third.

He was replaced by [[James Callaghan]] who immediately removed a number of left-wingers (such as [[Barbara Castle]]) from the cabinet.\n\nThe party in Scotland suffered the breakaway of two MPs into the [[Scottish Labour Party (1976\u20131981)|Scottish Labour Party]] (SLP). Whilst ultimately the SLP proved no real threat to the Labour Party's strong Scottish electoral base it did show that the issue of Scottish [[devolution]] was becoming increasingly contentious, especially after the discovery of [[North Sea Oil]].\n\n====Economic and political troubles====\nThe 1970s Labour government faced enormous economic problems and a precarious political situation. Faced with a global recession and spiralling [[inflation]]. Many of Britain's traditional manufacturing industries were collapsing in the face of foreign competition. Unemployment, and industrial unrest were rising.\n\n=====Economic record=====\nThe ambitious promise made by Labour in a 1973 party programme was to bring about \u201ca fundamental irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth, in favour of working people and their families.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=73-Trt8fqz8C&pg=PA140&dq=labour+programme+1973+irreversible+shift#v=onepage&q=labour%2520programme%25201973%2520irreversible%2520shift&f=false|title=The Labour Party and British Society: 1880\u20132005|last=Rubinstein|first=David|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=9781845190569|language=en}}</ref> Following an expansionary fiscal policy,<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\">Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974\u201379 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref> as characterised by boosts to public spending,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YamJGlX2_vkC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=denis+healey+1974+budgets+public+expenditure+increased#v=onepage&q=denis%2520healey%25201974%2520budgets%2520public%2520expenditure%2520increased&f=false|title=Good-bye, Great Britain: The 1976 IMF Crisis|last=Burk|first=Kathleen|authorlink1 = Kathleen Burk|last2=Cairncross|first2=Alec|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300057287|language=en}}</ref> more restrictive economic policies were adopted, with expenditure cuts and limits on wage increases. In 1975, for instance, an austerity budget was introduced that reduced public spending for 1977\u201378 by \u00a3900 million, at the expense of about 200,000 jobs.<ref>A history of British trade unionism c. 1770\u20131990 by Keith Laybourn</ref> To reduce high levels of inflation, various income policies were implemented that reduced the real earnings of most workers, with a 1980 Fabian study by Paul Ormerod noting that the attainment of lower inflation doesn't correspond with a rise in real incomes, as it would take two years (according to the economic models of the Treasury, the National Institute and the London Business School) that workers \u201ccan realise real wage increases through reductions in the rate of increase of prices following heir wage restraint.\u201d Recognising the negative impact that wage restraint was having on the living standards of ordinary workers, the government introduced expansionary budgets in March and October 1977 and again in April 1978, which were partly designed to boost take home pay in real terms via tax reductions. The April 1978 budget introduced a reduced tax rate band along with significant increases in child benefit.<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/> The so-called \u201cRooker-Wise\u201d amendment to a 1977 budget, named after the labour backbenchers Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise, indexed income tax allowances to cost-of-living rises as a means of safeguarding taxpayers from \u201cfiscal creep,\u201d a situation where inflation increases tax bills \u201cby reducing the real value of income tax allowances.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jTtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&dq=1977+rooker-wise+amendment+indexed+tax+allowances#v=onepage&q=1977%2520rooker-wise%2520amendment%2520indexed%2520tax%2520allowances&f=false|title=UK Monetary Policy from Devaluation to Thatcher, 1967\u201382|last=Needham|first=D.|date=2014-05-09|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137369543|language=en}}</ref> Despite such measures, however, most people by September 1978 \u201cwere no better off in real terms than they had been in March 1975.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/>\n\nBetween 1974 and 1977, real disposable incomes fell by approximately 7%, while according to the Family Expenditure Survey, the reduction in the disposable income of families with four children was as high as 20.% Although by 1978/79 the living standards of most household types had almost been restored to the levels they had reached back in 1973/74, this was, as noted by academic Peter Townsend, \u201cscarcely cause for congratulation for five years of Labour government.\u201d The share of government expenditure on goods and services declined from 24.5% in 1973/74 to 23.5% in 1978/79, while total spending (excluding debt interest) went down between 1975/76 and 1978/79 in real terms. Priority services for disabled people and the elderly were cut in a large number of areas while the number of discretionary LEA discretionary grants fell during Labour's latter period in office. While eligibility limits for free school meals had been made more generous, a 1977 price increase resulted in a fall of over 500,000 in the number of children eating school dinners and a rise of about 170,000 in the numbers eligible for free meals but not actually receiving them.<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/>\n\n=====Gains in education=====\nAccording to a study by Tessa Blackstone, Labour did score various achievements in the field of education. Between 1974 and 1979, nearly 1,000 new comprehensive schools were established, and by Labour's final year in office over 80% of children attended such schools. The number of further education courses carrying mandatory awards were increased in 1976. In addition, the amount spent per head rose considerably in the school sector between 1973/74 and 1976/77 (which was especially true of nursery, primary and special schools) and, while there had been reductions in expenditure per head at the post-school stage, there had been \u201ca small improvement in the distribution of resources towards the universal part of the system from which all benefit relative to the selective parts from which only a minority benefit.\u201d Nevertheless, according to the same study, the government failed to ensure that cuts in expenditure growth \u201cdid not hit some areas of education where working class children or adults were most likely to be affected; nor did it make much impact on redistributing existing resources.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/> In the field of taxation, a proposed wealth tax never materialised,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x12mAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT217&dq=denis+healey+wealth+tax#v=onepage&q=denis%2520healey%2520wealth%2520tax&f=false|title=Wealth and the wealthy: Exploring and tackling inequalities between rich and poor|last=Karen|first=Rowlingson|last2=D|first2=McKay, Stephen|date=2011-12-07|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=9781447308096|language=en}}</ref> and in 1977 the number of higher rate tax payers were reduced by a quarter while a further reduction took place a year later following amendments by the Conservative opposition supported by the Liberal Party.<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/>\n\n=====Outside financial help=====\nIn the autumn of 1976 the Labour Government under Chancellor [[Denis Healey]] was forced to ask the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for a loan to ease the economy through its financial troubles. The conditions attached to the loan included harsh [[austerity]] measures such as sharp cuts in public spending, which were highly unpopular with party supporters. This forced the government to abandon much of the radical program which it had adopted in the early 1970s, much to the anger of left wingers such as [[Tony Benn]]. It later turned out however that the loan had not been necessary. The error had been caused by incorrect financial estimates by the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] which overestimated public borrowing requirements.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\">Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, {{ISBN|0-333-92908-X}}</ref> The government only drew on half of the loan and was able to pay it back in full by 1979.\n\nThe 1970s Labour government adopted an [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] approach to the economy, setting up the [[National Enterprise Board]] to channel public investment into industry, and giving state support to ailing industries. Several large [[nationalisation]]s were carried out during this era: The struggling motor manufacturer [[British Leyland]] was partly nationalised in 1975. In 1977 [[British Aerospace]] as well as what remained of the [[British Shipbuilders|shipbuilding industry]] were nationalised, as well as the [[British National Oil Corporation]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> The Government also succeeded in replacing the ''Family Allowance'' with the more generous [[child benefit]], while the Development Land Tax of 1976 introduced an 80% tax on development gain after the first \u00a3160,000.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tEVbjlUaLREC&pg=PA235&dq=united+kingdom+Betterment+Levy+on+land+1967#v=onepage&q=united%2520kingdom%2520Betterment%2520Levy%2520on%2520land%25201967&f=false|title=Understanding Housing Policy|last=Lund|first=Brian|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=9781847426314|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=====No majority in Commons=====\nThe Wilson and Callaghan governments were hampered by their lack of a workable majority in the Commons. At the October 1974 election, Labour won a majority of only three seats. Several by-election losses meant that by 1977, Callaghan was heading a minority government, and was forced to do deals with other parties to survive. An arrangement was negotiated in 1977 with the Liberals known as the [[Lib-Lab pact]], but this ended after one year. After this, deals were made with the [[Scottish National Party]] and the [[Wales|Welsh]] nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], which prolonged the life of the government slightly longer.\n\n=====Scottish National Party withdraws support=====\nThe nationalist parties demanded [[devolution]] to their respective countries in return for their support for the government. When referenda for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979, the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh referendum]] was rejected outright, and the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] had a narrow majority in favour but did not reach the threshold of 40% support that the Labour government insisted must be met, invalidating the result. This led to the SNP withdrawing support for the government, which finally brought it down.\n\n===\"Winter of Discontent\" and defeat by Margaret Thatcher===\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] had caused a legacy of high [[inflation]] in the British economy which peaked at 26.9% in 1975. The Wilson and Callaghan governments attempted to combat this by entering into a [[social contract]] with the trade unions, which introduced [[wage restraint]] and limited pay rises to limits set by the government. This policy was initially fairly successful at controlling inflation, which had been reduced to 7.4% by 1978.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nCallaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978, when most opinion polls showed Labour to have a narrow lead.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> However instead, he decided to extend the wage restraint policy for another year in the hope that the economy would be in a better shape in time for a 1979 election. This proved to be a big mistake. The extension of wage restraint was unpopular with the trade unions, and the government's attempt to impose a \"5% limit\" on pay rises caused resentment amongst workers and trade unions, with whom relations broke down.\n\nDuring the winter of 1978\u201379 there were widespread [[Strike action|strikes]] in favour of higher pay rises which caused significant disruption to everyday life. The strikes affected lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers. These came to be dubbed as the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\".\n\nThe perceived relaxed attitude of Callaghan to the crisis reflected badly upon public opinion of the government's ability to run the country. After the withdrawal of SNP support for the government, the Conservatives put down a [[vote of no confidence]], which was held and passed by one vote on 28 March 1979, forcing a general election.\n\nIn the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], Labour suffered electoral defeat to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The numbers voting Labour hardly changed between February 1974 and 1979, but in 1979 the Conservative Party achieved big increases in support in the Midlands and South of England, mainly from the ailing Liberals, and benefited from a surge in turnout.\n\nThe actions of the trade unions during the Winter of Discontent were used by Margaret Thatcher's government to justify anti-trade union legislation during the 1980s.\n\nThe Wilson and Callaghan governments of the 1970s tried to control inflation (which reached 23.7% in 1975<ref name=\"SeldonHickson2004\">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Seldon|author2=Kevin Hickson|title=New Labour, old Labour: the Wilson and Callaghan governments, 1974\u201379|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gmy8wS1bBZwC&pg=PA64|accessdate=29 October 2010|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-31281-3|pages=64\u2013}}</ref>) by a policy of wage restraint. This was fairly successful, reducing inflation to 7.4% by 1978,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/><ref name=\"SeldonHickson2004\"/> but led to increasingly strained relations between the government and the trade unions. The Labour governments of the 1970s did, however, manage to protect many people from the economic storm, with pensions increasing by 20% in real terms between 1974 and 1979, while measures such as rent controls and food and transport subsidies prevented the incomes of other people from deteriorating further.<ref>The Labour Party: An introduction to its history, structure and politics edited by Chris Cook and Ian Taylor</ref>\n\nAs a means of improving the living standards of those in receipt of state benefits, the government index-linked short-term benefits to the rate of inflation, while pensions and long-term benefits were tied to increases in prices or earnings, whichever was higher (previously, benefit increases were tied only to prices).<ref>A Hard Pounding: Politics and Economic Crisis, 1974\u20131976 by Edmund Dell</ref> In addition, new benefits for the disabled and infirm were introduced whilst pensioners benefited from the largest ever increase in pensions up until that period.

As noted by the historian Eric Shaw: \"In the seventeen years that it occupied office, Labour accomplished much in alleviating poverty and misery, and in giving help and sustenance to groups \u2013 the old, the sick, the disabled \u2013 least capable of protecting themselves in a market economy.\"<ref name=\"Shaw\"/>\n\n==\"Wilderness Years\"==\n===Michael Foot===\n[[File:Michael Foot (1981).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Foot]], leader of the party in opposition against [[Margaret Thatcher]]]]\nThe aftermath of the 1979 election defeat saw a period of bitter internal rivalry in the Labour Party which had become increasingly divided between the ever more dominant left wingers under [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]] (whose supporters dominated the party organisation at the grassroots level), and the right under [[Denis Healey]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} It was widely considered that Healey would win the [[1980 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|1980 leadership election]], but he was narrowly defeated by Foot, who succeeded Callaghan as party leader late in 1980.\n\nThe Thatcher government was determined not to be deflected from its agenda as the Heath government had been. A [[deflationary]] budget in 1980 led to substantial cuts in welfare spending and an initial short-term sharp rise in unemployment. The Conservatives reduced or eliminated state assistance for struggling private industries, leading to large redundancies in many regions of the country, notably in Labour's heartlands. However, Conservative legislation extending the right for residents to buy council houses from the state proved very attractive to many Labour voters. (Labour had previously suggested this idea in their 1970 election manifesto, but had never acted on it.)\n\nThe election of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) veteran Michael Foot to the leadership disturbed many [[Atlanticism|Atlanticists]] in the party. Other changes increased their concern; the constituencies were given the ability to easily deselect sitting MPs, and a new voting system in leadership elections was introduced that gave party activists and affiliated trade unions a vote in different parts of an electoral college.\n\nThe party's move to the left in the early 1980s led to the decision by a number of centrist party members led by the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)#Creation of the SDP|Gang of Four]] of former Labour cabinet ministers ([[Shirley Williams]], [[William Rodgers]], [[Roy Jenkins]], and [[David Owen]]) to form the breakaway [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) on 25 January 1981. The broader aims of the party were set out in the [[Limehouse Declaration]] the following day.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Chris|last2=Stevenson|first2=John|title=Longman Handbook to Modern British History 1714 \u2013 2001|date=10 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317875246|page=144|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnMABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA144|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|St Ermin's group}}In 1981 the St Ermin's group of senior trade union leaders was created, meeting secretly every month initially at the [[St Ermin's Hotel]], who organised to prevent the [[Bennite]] left taking over the party. Four MPs also attended, [[Denis Howell]], [[John Golding (British politician)|John Golding]], [[Denis Healey]] and [[Giles Radice]]. The group was created following the 1981 special conference decision to establish an electoral college (40% trade unions, 30% members, 30% MPs) to elect the Labour Party leader and deputy rather than the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] choosing. A major effort of the group was to use union block votes to overturn the left's majority on the Labour [[National Executive Committee]] and the [[Trades Union Congress]] general council.<ref name=oxforddnb-ermins>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/96690?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true |title=St Ermins group (act. 1981\u20131987) |first=Dianne |last=Hayter |publisher=Oxford University Press |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk/records/HAY/4 |title=St Ermin's Group, also known as Trade Union Solidarity, 1979-1995 |work=Epexio |publisher=University of Warwick |accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe departure of members from the centre and right further swung the party to the left, but not quite enough to allow Tony Benn to be elected as Deputy Leader when he challenged for the job at the September 1981 party conference.<ref name=oxforddnb-ermins/>\n\nUnder Foot's leadership, the party's agenda became increasingly dominated by the politics of the [[hard left]]. Accordingly, the party went into the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] with the most left wing manifesto that Labour ever stood upon. It was indeed dubbed by the Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] as \"[[the longest suicide note in history]]\".\n\nThe manifesto contained pledges for abolition of the [[House of Lords]], unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the [[European Economic Community]], withdrawal from [[NATO]] and a radical and extensive extension of state control over the economy and financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vaidyanathan|first1=Rajini|title=Michael Foot: What did the 'longest suicide note' say?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8550425.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=4 April 2015|date=4 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis alienated many of the party's more right-wing supporters. The Bennites were in the ascendency and there was very little that the right could do to resist or water down the manifesto, many also hoped that a landslide defeat would discredit Michael Foot and the hard left of the party moving Labour away from explicit Socialism and towards weaker social-democracy.\n\nMuch of the press, particularly the sections backing the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, attacked both the Labour Party's manifesto and its style of campaigning, which tended to rely upon public meetings and canvassing rather than media. By contrast, the Conservatives ran a professional campaign which played on the voters' fears of a repeat of the Winter of Discontent. To add to this, the Thatcher government's popularity rose sharply on a wave of patriotic feeling following victory in the [[Falklands War]] in June 1982, allowing it to recover from its initial unpopularity over unemployment and economic difficulty. Indeed, Margaret Thatcher felt confident to call a general election for June 1983 despite not being obliged to do so for a further 12 months.\n\nAt the 1983 election, Labour suffered a landslide defeat, winning only 27.6% of the vote and securing just 209 seats. This was their worst performance at a general election since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]. Labour won only half a million votes more than the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]], which had attracted the votes of many moderate Labour supporters, although the Alliance only won 23 seats. Michael Foot criticised the Alliance for \"siphoning\" Labour support and allowing the Tories to win more seats.\n\n===Neil Kinnock===\n[[File:Start campagne voor Europese verkiezingen van PvdA (Rotterdam) Neal Kinnoch , k, Bestanddeelnr 932-9811.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Neil Kinnock]], leader of the party in opposition]]\nMichael Foot resigned and was replaced as leader by [[Neil Kinnock]] who was elected on 2 October 1983 and progressively moved the party towards the centre. Labour improved its performance in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102. They were now firmly established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats and it subsequently collapsed, prompting a merger of the SDP and Liberals to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were significant for Labour in the rise of left-wing Labour councils (derided by their opponents as the \"loony left\") which emphasised improvements in housing and amenities,<ref>{{cite book|url={{GBurl|MSPh2KRNhe0C}} |title=Eco-Socialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice |date=1993-08-18 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> participation and rights for women and minorities, workers\u2019 control, decentralisation, and opposition to neoliberalism. The left regarded local councils as part of an extra-parliamentary mode of opposition, alongside community groups and town halls. David Blunkett, once a member of Labour's left-wing, described Labour town halls as \"a rudimentary opposition movement against the ruling party in Westminster.\" The left councils greatly advanced the cause of blacks, women, and homosexuals within the political system, while also opening up council-decision making.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIncreasingly, some Labour councils were radicalised to act in open defiance of the Thatcher Government. Instead of cutting expenditure, they raised rates and all kinds of borrowing and lease-back arrangements were entered into with overseas banks and private financial institutions in order to sustain capital programmes. The increased radicalisation of Labour councils during this period could be attributed to the policies of the Thatcher Government, which involved reductions in government financial aid to both council housing and local authorities, together with a change in the government's allocation formula so that local authority areas of high expenditure were disproportionately affected. As noted by [[Peter Shore]],\n\n{{quote|Since the areas of critical housing need were invariably Labour-controlled, as were the high-spending councils where social needs of all kinds were at their greatest, it was Labour councils in inner-city areas that were targeted to take the full brunt of government expenditure cuts.<ref>Leading The Left by Peter Shore</ref>}}\n\nThe Greater London Council, under the leadership of Ken Livingstone from 1981 to 1986, carried out a number of progressive policies<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Marcy|url={{GBurl|K3er4u_qU9EC|p=PA11}} |title=Democratizing Public Services: Lessons from Other Jurisdictions and Implications for Health Care Reform in BC |accessdate=2013-05-31|isbn=9780886274092 |year=2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Stephen|url={{GBurl|ozVM8IkcPWkC|p=PA237|dq=|q=}} |title=Sexual Politics: Sexuality, Family Planning, and the British Left from the 1880s to the Present Day|date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2013-05-31|isbn=9780199562541 }}</ref> such as a programme of grants to voluntary groups (which cost \u00a347 million in 1984\u201385: \u00a3100 million in 1999 prices) and a \"Fares Fair\" policy, which cut London Transport fares by 25%. Although this policy was controversially ruled out by a House of Lords judgement, it was replaced by a more subtle cheap fares policy before London Transport was removed from GLC control by the government in 1984.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn 1983, The Liverpool Labour party (then under the effective control of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group) embarked upon an ambitious programme of municipal reform. Apart from promoting propaganda for class conflict, as characterised by continual protests and \"days of action\" in which council workers and even school pupils were encouraged to participate, the Liverpool council devoted much time and effort to improving the quality of the inner-city environment. New houses were constructed, while new parks, sports centres,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and other leisure facilities were created. In addition, within a short period of time, 8,000 housing units were refurbished and 4,000 units had been built.<ref>Cities in the International Marketplace: The Political Economy of Urban Development in North America and Western Europe by H.V. Savitch and Paul Kantor</ref> Altogether, the results were an improvement on previous councils run by all parties.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Following the 1987 election, Kinnock resumed the expulsion of Militant's members from the party which had begun under his predecessor.\n\nDuring the course of the 1980s, the GLC and several other Labour councils attempted to promote local economic recovery by setting up a network of enterprise boards and agencies. In addition, the GLC, Glasgow, Liverpool, Sheffield, and smaller London councils like Lambeth, Camden, and Islington adopted policies that challenged the Thatcher Government's insistence on budgetary cuts and privatisation.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\nThe Labour councils in old metropolitan counties of West Midlands, South Yorkshire, Greater London, and Greater Manchester led the way in developing interventionist economic policies. In these metropolitan county areas, Inward Investment Agencies, Enterprise Boards, Low Pay Units, and Co-operative Development Agencies proliferated, while parts of the country such as Salford Quays and Cardiff Bay were redeveloped. The Labour council in Birmingham in the 1980s worked to diversify the business visitor economy, as characterised by the decision to build a new, purpose-built convention centre in a decaying, inner-city district around Broad Street. By the mid-1990s, the success of this strategy was evident by the success of the International convention centre leading to wider redevelopment, as characterised by the building of a Sea Life Centre, the National Indoor Arena, bars, hotels, and thousands of newly constructed and refurbished flats and houses. This helped to revitalise the city centre and brought in people and money to both and the city and the West Midlands region as a whole.<ref name=\"Yeowell Bates 2008\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Labour councils vied to attract inward investment and build themselves up as tourist and retail centres. The relatively left-wing Labour council in Southampton was popular among property developers for its ambitious city centre plans, while the labour council in Sheffield set up a partnership with businesses in order to redevelop a large part of the city that had been abandoned by the decline of the steel industry. Some Labour councils also remedied the neglect of management and service delivery during the mid 1980s under the Thatcher Government and introduced charters and guaranteed standards of service for local residents before a similar \"Citizen\u2019s Charter\" was launched by the Major Government.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn November 1990, Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by [[John Major]]. Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories in the 18 months leading up to Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on the introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. One of the reasons Thatcher gave for her resignation was that she felt the Tories would stand a better chance of re-election with a new leader at the helm.\n\nThe change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 in spite of the continuing recession, although Labour regained the lead of the polls more than once that year. John Major resisted calls within parliament to hold a general election throughout 1991.\n\nThe \"yo yo\" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority, suggesting that Labour could only rule as a [[minority government]] or in [[Coalition government|coalition with other parties]]. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme \"It's Time for a Change\", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule \u2013 which had seen two recessions. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a dramatic change in the change of leader from Margaret Thatcher to [[John Major]], at least in terms of style if not substance, whereas Kinnock was now the longest serving leader of any of the major political parties at the time and was now the longest-serving opposition leader in British political history.\n\nFrom the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 \"Poll of Polls\" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.\n\nThe [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] on 9 April was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21, despite the Conservative mandate being at a record of more than 14 million votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm|title=1992: Tories win again against odds|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for members and supporters of the Labour party, and there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government, just as there had been back in 1959, while at the same time there were doubts with the Conservative Party as to whether a fifth successive election victory was a likelihood.\n\nEven before the country went to the polls, it seemed doubtful as to whether Labour could win a parliamentary majority as an 8% electoral swing was needed across the country for this to be achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/pastelec/ge92lab.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}</ref> When Labour lost the election, there was widespread public and media debate as to whether the party could ever return to government, as had happened in 1959, not least due to the fact that it had failed to beat an incumbent Conservative government during a time of recession and high unemployment \u2013 an economic climate which would normally be expected to result in a change of government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1992_over.stm |title=VOTE2001 &#124; THE ELECTION BATTLES 1945\u20131997 |work=BBC News |accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the party's inquiry into why it had lost, it was considered that the \"Shadow Budget\" announced by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] had opened the way for Conservatives to attack the party for wanting to raise taxes{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. In addition, a triumphalist party [[Sheffield Rally|rally held in Sheffield]] eight days before the election, was generally considered to have backfired. The party had also suffered from a powerfully co-ordinated campaign from the right-wing press, particularly [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper. Kinnock, who in particular had been vilified by ''The Sun'' with headlines including \"Nightmare on Kinnock Street\" and the election day front-page headline \"If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights\", resigned after the defeat, blaming the right-wing media for Labour's failure to win the election.\n\n===John Smith===\n[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] was elected to succeed Kinnock in July 1992 despite his involvement with the Shadow Budget.\n\nSmith's leadership once again saw the re-emergence of tension between those on the party's left and those identified as \"modernisers\", both of whom advocated radical revisions of the party's stance albeit in different ways. At the 1993 conference, Smith successfully changed the party rules and lessened the influence of the trade unions on the selection of candidates to stand for Parliament by introducing a [[one member, one vote]] system called OMOV \u2014 but only barely, after a barnstorming speech by [[John Prescott]] which required Smith to compromise on other individual negotiations.\n\nThe [[Black Wednesday]] economic disaster in September 1992, which led to Britain's exit from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]], left the Conservative government's reputation for monetary excellence in shreds, and by the end of that year Labour had a comfortable lead over the Tories in the opinion polls. Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong.\n\nThe growing strength of the Labour Party during the 1990s was demonstrated by its success in preventing the passage of two major policy initiatives of the Major Government. Plans to privatise [[Royal Mail]] were abandoned as a result of pressure from Labour, the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communications Workers Union]] and voters in Conservative rural heartlands who sought to protect post office services. Another major policy abandonment came as a result of [[Norman Lamont]]\u2019s 1993 announcement that VAT on domestic fuel and lighting would be introduced, starting at a rate of 8% in April 1994 and reaching the full rate the following April. The Labour Party launched a massive public campaign against the controversial tax, collecting 1.5 million signatures on a petition. An important House of Commons vote on introducing the second stage of the tax took place in December 1994. Concerted pressure was put on Conservative backbenchers from marginal seats to vote against the controversial tax, and in the end the Major Government was narrowly defeated, with 319 voting against the tax compared to 311 for. This not only represented a victory for the Labour party\u2019s campaign, but it further demonstrated Labour's social democratic credentials and its growing political strength.<ref>The People\u2019s Party: the History of the Labour Party by Tony Wright and Matt Carter</ref>  During this period party membership increased dramatically, rising from 305,000 in 1994 to a high point of 405,000 in 1998.<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=Membership of UK political parties |url=https://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05125.pdf |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |page=9 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423150318/https://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05125.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2010 |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nJohn Smith died suddenly on 12 May 1994 of a massive heart attack, prompting a [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]] for his successor, likely to be the next Prime Minister. With 57% of the vote, [[Tony Blair]] won a resounding victory in a three-way contest with John Prescott and [[Margaret Beckett]]. Prescott became deputy leader, coming second in the poll whose results were announced on 21 July 1994.\n\n==New Labour==\n{{Main|New Labour}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:TonyBlairBasra.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Tony Blair]], Labour Prime Minister (1997\u20132007)]]\n\"New Labour\" was an alternative branding for the Labour Party, used primarily during the period under [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership. Being used first as a slogan, its first appearance in party literature was the 1996 draft manifesto, ''[[New Labour, New Life For Britain]]''. The rise of the name coincided with a rightwards shift of the British political spectrum; for Labour, this was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of [[Neil Kinnock]]. \"Old Labour\" is sometimes used by commentators to describe the older, more left-wing members of the party, or those with strong Trade Union connections.\n\nTony Blair, [[Gordon Brown]], [[Peter Mandelson]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Alastair Campbell]] are most commonly cited as the creators and architects of \"New Labour\". Blair proposed a rewrite of [[Clause IV]] of the party constitution, abandoning the party's commitments and what Blair referred to as \"state socialism\" (as opposed to [[ethical socialism]]). The party became an advocate of the shift in European [[social democracy]] during the 1990s, known as the \"[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]\". Although this policy was advantageous to the Labour Party in the eyes of the British electorate, it alienated many grassroots members by distancing itself from the ideals of socialism in favour of free market policy decisions.\n\nThe \"modernisation\" of Labour Party policy and the unpopularity of [[John Major]]'s Conservative government, along with a well co-ordinated use of PR, greatly increased Labour's appeal to \"[[middle England]]\". The party was concerned not to put off potential voters who had previously supported the Conservatives, and pledged to keep to the spending plans of the previous government, and not to increase the basic rate of income tax. The party won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] with a landslide majority of 179. Following a second and third election victory in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]] and the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], the name has diminished in significance. \"New Labour\" as a name has no official status but remains in common use to distinguish modernisers from those holding to more traditional positions who normally are referred to as \"Old Labour\".\n\nMany of the traditional grassroots working-class members of the Labour Party who became upset and disillusioned with \"New\" Labour, left the Party and went on to join political parties such as the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]], the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]] and even the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} \u2013 all parties claiming to never neglect the \"ordinary British people\". [[David Osler]], the journalist and author of \"Labour Party plc\" seems to hint in his book that Labour's supposed steady shift from Socialism and its neglect of support for the working-class people of Britain began to show during the Party's years under Harold Wilson. In the book, Osler claimed that the Party is now only a socialist party and indeed a \"Labour\" party in name only and is a capitalism-embracing Party which differs little from the Tory Party. Other historians have also argued that Old Labour's record in putting its social democratic ideals into practice was less successful than comparable northern European sister parties.<ref name=\"Shaw\"/>\n\n===In government===\n{{main|Premiership of Tony Blair|Premiership of Gordon Brown}}\nThe Labour Party won the 1997 general election with a landslide majority of 179; it was the largest Labour majority ever, and the largest swing to a political party achieved since [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]].

As a result of this initiative, by 2009 8% of England's total social housing stock was considered to be unfit, compared with 39% in 2001. The New Deal programme found work for half-a-million long-term unemployed young people, although studies highlighted concerns over the effect of stricter conditions for unemployment benefit on single younger men. Between 1997 and 2009, cash spending on education was doubled, representing a real-terms increase of three-quarters.

In the 1930s and 1940s, it stressed national planning, using nationalization of industry as a tool, in line with [[Clause IV]] of the original constitution of the Labour Party which called for the \"common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service\" (this clause was eventually revised in 1994).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clause-iv-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-so-divisive-10447639.html|title=What is Clause IV and why is it so divisive?|work=The Independent|date=9 August 2015|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nLabour has had several spells in government, first as minority governments under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924 and 1929\u20131931. MacDonald and half his cabinet split with the mainstream of the party and were denounced as traitors. Labour was a junior partner in the wartime coalition from 1940\u20131945. After the famous [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] landslide under [[Clement Attlee]] (1945\u20131951) it set up the [[welfare state]] with the [[National Health Service]], nationalised a fifth of the economy, joined [[NATO]] and opposed the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. Under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964\u20131970 it promoted economic modernisation. Labour was in government again in 1974\u20131979 under Wilson and then [[James Callaghan]]. Escalating economic crises (the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\") and a split with [[David Owen]] and others forming the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], resulted in opposition status during the Thatcher years from 1979\u20131990.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nLabour returned with a 179-seat majority in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]]. The party's large majority in the House of Commons was slightly reduced to 167 in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] and more substantially reduced to 66 in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. Under [[Gordon Brown]], it was defeated in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], becoming the opposition to a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition]]. After further losses in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], party leader [[Ed Miliband]] resigned with the party in opposition to a [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative majority government]] under [[David Cameron]].\n\n==Founding of the party==\n===Background===\nThe Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century numeric increase of the urban proletariat and the extension of the [[suffrage|franchise]] to [[working-class]] males, when it became apparent that there was a need for a political party to represent the interests and needs of those groups.<ref>See, for instance, the 1899 [[Lyons vs. Wilkins]] judgement, which limited certain types of picketing</ref> Some members of the trade union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely [[middle-class]] [[Fabian Society]], the [[Social Democratic Federation]] and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888\u20131893)|Scottish Labour Party]].\n\nIt was during this period that British socialism began to make headway in local government. In 1889, [[Progressive Party (London)|a \"Progressive\" party]] composed of [[Fabians]] and [[British Liberals]] took control of [[London County Council]] at the first elections held there. This was the first council to have substantial socialist influence, and carried out a programme of municipalisation, while constructing some of the first social housing in England and increasing public spending on services such as the Fire Brigade.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The Labour Party: A Centenary History edited by Brian Brivati and Richard Hefferman</ref>  In addition, the number of parks and public baths were increased, London's sewerage system was improved, roads were widened and paved, and the [[Blackwall Tunnel]], linking the Isle of Dogs with Greenwich, was opened in 1897.<ref name=\"Yeowell Bates 2008\">{{cite book |last1=Yeowell |first1=Nathan |last2=Bates |first2=Dennis |title=Leading the Way: Labour Local Government's Response to the Credit Crunch |date=2008 |publisher=[[Local Government Association]] |isbn=978-0-9560346-1-8 |url=https://www.leadershipcentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Leading-the-way1.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2019 }}</ref> The [[Women's Labour League]], which was active in the field of social policy, set up a child welfare clinic in Kensington before the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Harmer\">The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900\u20131998 by Harry Harmer</ref>\n\nIn 1892, [[Fred Jowett]] (a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]]) became the first socialist to be elected to [[Bradford City Council]]. A few months later, Jowett founded a branch of the Independent Labour Party in that city. As a member of Bradford City Council, Jowett was responsible for the passage of several important reforms that were eventually adopted by other local authorities. In 1904, for instance, [[Bradford]] became the first local authority in Britain to provide [[free school meal]]s, while a successful campaign led to the clearing of a slum area and its replacement with new houses. Jowett was also a supporter of reforming the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]], and attempted to improve the quality of the food given to the children in the [[Little Horton#Little Horton in the industrial age|Bradford Workhouse]] after being elected as a [[Poor Law Guardians|Poor Law Guardian]].\n\nIn 1898, West Ham borough became the first ever Labour council.<ref>Currents of Radicalism: Popular Radicalism, Organised Labour and Party Politics in Britain, 1850\u20131914 by Eugenio F.

[[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups.\n\n===Labour Representation Committee===\n[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]\n\nIn 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R. Steels, proposed in his union branch that the [[Trades Union Congress]] call a special conference to bring together all left-wing organisations and form them into a single body that would sponsor Parliamentary candidates. The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the [[Congregational Memorial Hall]] on Farringdon Street on 26 and 27 February 1900. The meeting was attended by a broad spectrum of working-class and left-wing organisations&nbsp;\u2014 trades unions represented about one third of the membership of the TUC delegates.<ref>[http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM \u2018The formation of the Labour Party \u2013 Lessons for today\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622225821/http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM |date=22 June 2008 }} Jim Mortimer, 2000; Jim Mortimer was a General Secretary of the Labour Party in the 1980s</ref>\n\nAfter a debate, the 129 delegates passed Hardie's motion to establish \"a distinct Labour group in Parliament, who shall have their own whips, and agree upon their policy, which must embrace a readiness to cooperate with any party which for the time being may be engaged in promoting legislation in the direct interests of labour\". This created an association called the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), meant to coordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trades unions and represent the working-class population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/history_of_the_labour_party |title=History of the Labour Party |publisher=Labour Party |date=27 February 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414220901/http://www2.labour.org.uk/history_of_the_labour_party |archivedate=14 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|October 1900]] \"Khaki election\" came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to \u00a333.<ref>Wright T. & Carter M, (1997) ''\"The People's Party\"'' Thames & Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-27956-X}}</ref> Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful; [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nSupport for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay \u00a323,000 damages for a strike. The judgment effectively made strikes illegal since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the Liberal Party in opposition to the Conservative's landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.<ref>Norman McCord, \"Taff Vale Revisited,\" ''History'' 78#253 (1993), pp. 243\u2013260 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24421680 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]\n\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats\u2014helped by a [[Lib-Lab pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and Liberal [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.<ref>Frank Bealey, \"The Electoral Arrangement between the Labour Representation Committee and the Liberal Party,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 28#4 (1956), pp. 353\u2013373 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871799 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nIn their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name \"The Labour Party\" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the Leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> while Labour parliamentarians encouraged and supported progressive measures such as the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]], the [[Mines Act 1908]],<ref>British Economic and Social History 1700\u20131964 by C.P. Hill</ref> the [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908]], and compulsory medical inspections in state schools.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/> In 1906, the Labour Party scored its first ever legislative success in the new Parliament with the passage of a bill put forward by the Labour MP Fred Jowett in the form of the [[Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLabour's influence in the passage of the [[Liberal welfare reforms]] was the result of an informal Labour-Liberal alliance that was established in the run up to the general election of 1906. The Labour and Liberal parties reached agreement to accommodate each other's candidates. The Liberals, who were eager to cut deadweight electoral losses to the Conservatives, arrived at a list of 30 constituencies in which they would \"stand down\", thereby giving the LRC free run against Conservatives in exchange for some sway over LRC campaign planks. Winning 25 out of the 30 seats in question, Labour helped [[H. H. Asquith]]\u2019s government pass Britain\u2019s first national pension law in 1908 and, after extended collaboration in the election of 1910, the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] providing both health and unemployment insurance.<ref>Social Democracy and Welfare Capitalism: A Century of Income Security Politics by Alexander Hicks</ref>\n\n==Early years and the rise of the Labour Party==\nThe Labour Party was emerging from the rapidly growing union movement after 1890. It formed an alliance with the Liberal Party that allowed for cross support in elections, and permitted the emergence of a small labour contingent in Parliament. It was a temporary arrangement until the 1920s, when the Labour Party was strong enough to act on its own, and the Liberals were in an irreversible decline. The causes were subtle social changes in the working class that produced the younger generation that wanted to act independently. Michael Childs argues that the younger generation had reason to prefer Labour over Liberal political styles. Social factors included secularized elementary education (with a lesser role for Dissenting Protestantism); the \"New Unionism\" after 1890 brought unskilled workers into a movement previously dominated by the skilled workers;<ref>G.R. Searle, ''A new England?: peace and war, 1886\u20131918'' (2004), pp 185\u201387.</ref> and new leisure-time activities, especially the music hall and sports, enthralled youth while repelling the older generation of Liberal voters. Childs notes that the 1918 electoral reforms added many young working-class voters, and the passing of older Liberal-oriented age cohorts during the 1920s enabled Labour to supplant the Liberals.<ref>Michael Childs,  \"Labour Grows Up: The Electoral System, Political Generations, and British Politics 1890\u20131929.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 6#2 (1995): 123\u2013144.</ref>\n\nThe [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that Trades Unions in the United Kingdom could no longer donate money to fund the election campaigns and wages of Labour MPs. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the Trade Unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest Trades Unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow Trade Unions to fund Labour MPs once more.\n\nBy 1914, there were about 420 Labour representatives sitting on municipal Councils of various kinds, not including a few County councilors in the mining areas, or a much larger number on Boards of Guardians, Parish Councils, and District Councils. Aside from education, and the feeding and medical inspection and treatment of schoolchildren, the issues which the Labour Party pressed most urgently in local government were the local provision of work for the unemployed, the eight-hour workday, the adoption and enforcement of the Fair Wages Clause in public contracts, and fair wages and conditions for local authority employees. In some areas (particularly Birmingham and Glasgow) there was active pressure in support of municipal housing and [[slum clearance]] schemes, while there was also continued agitation (in relation to the Board of guardians) for improved treatment both of the unemployed and other classes of paupers, particularly the disabled and the aged. House-building, midway between a public health service and a trading enterprise, became one of the main planks in the Labour municipal platform.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===World War I===\nWorld War I marked the break through for the party, as the Liberals declined sharply and Labour moved into second place behind the Conservatives.  Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that \"Labour's ability to make so much of the opportunities offered by the war was due, mainly, the parties basic underlying unity during the conflict.\"  <ref>Andrew Thorpe, ''A History of the British Labour Party'' (3rd ed. 2008)) pp 36\u201359</ref> Before the war the party was officially committed to the antiwar argument that capitalism caused warfare. However, the invasion of Belgium and the surge of pro-war attitudes among the membership of the party led increasingly to support of the war.  [[Ramsay MacDonald]] continued to oppose the war, but he quickly resigned as party leader and was replaced by [[Arthur Henderson]], who was strongly committed to defeating Germany.  In 1915, the Labour Party gained ministerial office for the first time when Henderson was invited to join Asquith's wartime government. Asquith wanted the co-operation of the trade union movement to greatly expand munitions production. Henderson became President of the Board of Education and served as adviser to Asquith on labour issues. Minor positions were given to G. H. Roberts and William Bruce. In December 1916, when Asquith was replaced by [[David Lloyd George]], more Labour leaders were included in more important positions.<ref>Chris Wrigley, ''David Lloyd George and the British labour movement: peace and war'' (1976) ch 1.</ref>  Henderson was promoted to the inner war cabinet, while [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]] of the engineers became Minister of Pensions and [[John Hodge (politician)|John Hodge]] of the steel workers became Minister of Labour. William Bruce, G. H. Roberts, and James Parker (another Labour MP) took minor posts.<ref>Eric Hopkins, ''A Social History of the English Working Classes 1815\u20131945''</ref>\n\nDespite mainstream Labour Party's support for the war effort, the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the Non-Conscription Fellowship while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes. Arthur Henderson resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. Overall, however, the majority of the movement continued to support the war for the duration of the conflict, and the British Labour Party, unlike most of its equivalents on the Continent, did not split over the war.<ref>David Swift, ''For Class and Country: the Patriotic Left and the First World War'' (2017)</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the First World War, while serving both inside and outside of government, the Labour Party was able to influence a number of progressive developments in social policy. At a time when 90% of housing was privately rented, landlords sought to increase rents in the face of rising wartime prices (and in some cases as a means of profiteering). This resulted in a range of largely spontaneous protests in 1915 which were then often co-ordinated by local Labour movements, such as that in Glasgow, where the ILP played a leading role. This forced the government to pass legislation which fixed wartime rents at pre-war levels. This was significant in that it showed labour to be the party that would defend working-class interests in housing, more than its rivals, while also helping Labour to move away from trade union related issues towards areas which had some direct appeal to women, in particular. In addition, as argued by Andrew Thorpe, it also \"added credibility to the idea of state action to control market forces which disadvantaged the working class.\"<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nThe Labour Party also campaigned for \"fair shares,\" attacking profiteering and unrestricted market forces, and secured some advances by applying pressure on the government. The Labour Party pushed hard for high taxation of war profits, rationing, and other controls, and in 1917 with J.R. Clynes at the Food Commission and in 1918 as Controller, price controls were introduced which stabilised food prices, while rationing, which came into operation at the beginning of 1918, ensuring a real degree of \"fair play.\" An excess profits duty was also introduced in 1915 which stood at 80% by 1917, and Labour's credentials were further established by the WEC's \"Conscription of Riches\" campaign, launched in 1916.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tony Judge|title=J.R. Clynes, A Political Life|date=2016|isbn=9781518761980|pages=111\u2013114}}</ref>\n\n{{quote\n|text = Since \u2018fair play\u2019 was one of the great traditions of British radicalism, it was clearly to Labour\u2019s advantage to push in this direction, and the fact that such policies could be implemented greatly enhanced labour\u2019s general credibility.\n|sign = Andrew Thorpe, ''A History of The British Labour Party''<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n}}\n\nThe wartime experience of the Labour ministers made them feel more confident of their party's ability to use the machinery of state to bring about social change, and encouraged them to resist policies of \"direct action\" urged by local ''Soviets'' and the fledgling [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref name=\"Pugh\"/> However, at the 1918 Labour Party Conference, the Party adopted [[Clause IV]] into its constitution, which had been drafted by [[Sidney Webb]] the year previously, and which called for \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\"\n\nThe growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation between 1921 and 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library|date= |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Party declined rapidly and the party suffered a catastrophic split that allowed the Labour Party to co-opt much of the Liberals' support.\n\nWith the Liberals in disarray Labour won 142 seats in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government. After the election the now-rehabilitated Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|leader of the Labour Party]].\n\nProgress continued in local government. In 1919 [[John Adams, 1st Baron Adams|John Adams]] (later Baron Adams of Ennerdale) led a successful election challenge to the sitting members of Arlecdon and Frizington District Council in Cumberland. This established the first all-Labour local council to be elected in England.\n\nElections for the Women's Sections were carried out by postal ballot in 1931.

So with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became Prime Minister in January 1924 and formed the first ever Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).\n\nBecause the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals, it was unable to get any arguably socialist legislation passed by the House of Commons. The most significant measure was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]] which began a building programme of 500,000 homes for rent to working-class families.\n\nThe government collapsed after only nine months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the hoaxed [[Zinoviev letter]], which implicated Labour in a plot for a Communist revolution in Britain, and the Conservatives were returned to power, although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% of the popular vote to a third of the popular vote\u2014most of the Conservative gains were at the expense of the Liberals. The Zinoviev letter is now generally believed to have been a forgery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1819658.ece|title=The truth about Churchill's spy chief and the Zinoviev Letter|last=|first=|date=8 October 2006|work=The Independent|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020000558/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1819658.ece|archive-date=20 October 2006|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===General strike===\nThe new Conservative government led by [[Stanley Baldwin]] took decisive control of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike of 1926]], ending it in nine days by bringing in middle-class strikebreakers and averting violence.

However, MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald's government included the first ever woman cabinet minister [[Margaret Bondfield]] who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History 1914\u20131945'' (1965) pp 264\u201397.</ref>\n\nMacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 he was able to pass a revised Old Age Pensions Act, a more generous Unemployment Insurance Act, and an act to improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike). Under the Coal Mines Act 1930, for instance, marketing schemes for output and price regulation were set up, while a commission was appointed to promote schemes of unification. Minimum wages and subsistence allowances were fixed for one year, while measures for miner's safety were increased and improved. The Pensions Act of 1929 granted pensions to over 500,000 children, old people, and widows who had previously been excluded from the pensions system.<ref>The Record of the Second Labour Government, The Labour Publications Dept., Transport House, Smith Square, London, S.W.1., October 1935</ref>\n\n====Great Depression and the split under MacDonald====\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and eventual [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] occurred soon after the government came to power, and the crisis hit Britain hard. By the end of 1930 the unemployment rate had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">A. J. Davies, ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'' (1996)</ref>\n\nThe Labour government struggled to cope with the crisis and found itself attempting to reconcile two contradictory aims; achieving a balanced budget in order to maintain the [[pound sterling|pound]] on the [[Gold Standard]], whilst also trying to maintain assistance to the poor and unemployed. All of this whilst tax revenues were falling. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Philip Snowden]] refused to permit [[deficit spending]].<ref>Taylor, ''English History 1914\u20131945'' (1965) pp 284\u201397.</ref>\n\nOne junior minister, [[Oswald Mosley]], put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the public control of imports and banking as well as an increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and went on to form the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], and later the [[British Union of Fascists]] after he converted to [[Fascism]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mandle | first1 = W.

Under pressure from its Liberal allies as well as the Conservative opposition who feared that the budget was unbalanced, the Labour government appointed a committee headed by Sir [[George May, 1st Baron May|George May]] to review the state of public finances. The [[May Report]] of July 1931 urged public-sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending (notably in payments to the unemployed) in order to avoid a budget deficit.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McKibbin | first1 = Ross | year = 1975 | title = The Economic Policy of the Second Labour Government 1929\u20131931 | journal = Past & Present | volume = 68 | issue = 68| pages = 95\u2013123 | jstor=650274 | doi=10.1093/past/68.1.95}}</ref>\n\nThis proposal proved deeply unpopular within the Labour Party grass roots and the [[trade union]]s, which along with several government ministers, refused to support any such measures. Several senior ministers such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[J. R. Clynes]] threatened to resign rather than agree to the cuts.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> MacDonald, and Philip Snowden however, insisted that the Report's recommendations must be adopted to avoid incurring a budget deficit.\n\nThe dispute over spending and wage cuts split the Labour government; as it turned out, fatally. The cabinet repeatedly failed to agree to make cuts to spending or introduce tariffs. The resulting political deadlock caused investors to take fright, and a flight of capital and gold further de-stabilised the economy. In response, MacDonald, on the urging of the king agreed to form a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], with the Conservatives and the small group of Liberals. On 24 August 1931 MacDonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led a small number of his senior colleagues, most notably Snowden and Dominions Secretary [[James Henry Thomas|J. H. Thomas]], in forming the National Government with the other parties. MacDonald and his supporters were then expelled from the Labour Party and formed [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]].

The only former Labour cabinet member who survived the landslide was the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], who accordingly became party leader.\n\nThe party experienced a further split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party. The ILP embarked on a long drawn out decline. The role of the ILP within the Labour Party was taken up for a time by the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], which operated inside the Labour Party and was led by [[Stafford Cripps]], which attracted several thousand teachers and intellectuals. In 1937 when the Socialist League proposed a [[Popular Front (UK)|Popular Front]] coalition with Communists, the Labour Party closed it down.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pimlott | first1 = Ben | year = 1971 | title = The Socialist League: Intellectuals and the Labour Left in the 1930s | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 12\u201338 | jstor=259876 | doi=10.1177/002200947100600302}}</ref>\n\n===Economics===\nThe Labour Party moved to the [[left-wing politics|left]] during the early 1930s. At the 1932 conference [[Somerville Hastings]] of the [[Socialist Medical Association]] moved a resolution, which was carried, calling for the establishment of a State Medical Service and in 1934 Conference unanimously accepted an official document on a National Health Service largely prepared by SMA members.<ref name=\"Pemberton Books\">{{cite book|last1=Stark Murray|first1=David|title=Why a National Health Service contents|date=1971|publisher=Pemberton Books|location=London|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/resources/national-health-service/the-sma-and-the-foundation-of-the-national-health-service-dr-leslie-hilliard-1980/why-a-national-health-service/why-a-national-health-service-chapter-2-the-socialist-medical-association/}}</ref> The party's programme \"''For Socialism and Peace''\" adopted in 1934, committed the party to [[nationalisation]] of land, banking, coal, iron and steel, transport, power and water supply, as well as the setting up of a National Investment Board to plan industrial development.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> [[Harold Laski]], a highly influential professor and pamphleteer began to argue that a peaceful, democratic transition to socialism was unlikely because the opposition would resort to violence, and Labour had to be prepared.<ref>Michael Newman, \"Laski, Harold Joseph (1893\u20131950)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 11 June 2013 doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/34412</ref>\n\nThere was little innovation in party thinking on economic issues. \"Planning\" and \"nationalisation\" remained little more than slogans that  [[Hugh Dalton]], the chief economic spokesman, promised would create a new Jerusalem that left economic hardship behind. Party leader Attlee avoided economics. By contrast, the small surviving Liberal party had elaborate analyses and proposals thanks to its experts such as  [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[William Beveridge]]. When Labour came to power in 1945, it discovered there were no plans on how to conduct nationalisation. No preparation had been made for the shortages in coal that experts had warned was coming.  Attlee and his fellow leaders based their postwar policies on wartime experiences.<ref>Alan Booth, \"How Long are Light Years in British Politics?

Nevertheless, they remained a small weak party in Parliament.\n\n==Local Labour reforms in the inter-war period==\nAlthough Labour remained out of office for most of the inter-war period, it was able to control many local authorities and put its socialist principles into practice on a small scale.\n\n{{quote\n| text = The Labour-controlled local authorities, and also those in which Labour was the strongest single party, had in practice to concentrate mainly on making the most of the opportunities offered to them by national legislation \u2013 especially in the fields of housing, education, public health services, and, after 1929, the services transferred to them from the Boards of Guardians. In all these fields, Labour had a notably good local government record.\n| sign = [[G. D. H. Cole]], ''A History of the Labour Party from 1914''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n}}\nDuring the inter-war period, Labour in local government sought to use the power of municipal authority to improve the working and living environments of its primarily working-class constituents. The functions of local government provided Labour Party members with experience in office, and provided them with the opportunity to improve the living standards of its constituents through measures such as improvements in housing and health care, the provision of maternity clinics, and free milk and meals for schoolchildren.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/> Following the end of [[World War I]], Labour councillors returned in 1919 adopted a policy of municipal socialism (particularly in boroughs of London) to tackle social problems such as poor health, inadequate housing, and general insecurity. Labour in local government sought to establish a \"proto-welfare state\" through, for instance, the elected Boards of Guardians, paying more generous levels of poor relief to the jobless and encouraging the construction of clinics, houses, and municipal baths which, apart from providing necessary services, also provided employment opportunities.<ref name=\"Harmer\"/> Also, although Labour groups often remained in the minority on their respective councils, they and their supporters mounted campaigns to safeguard and extend people's standard of living. For example, minority Labour groups could block council initiatives that they saw as going against the interests of their constituents.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\nDuring the 1920s, Labour councillors forced the pace in local administration, whether in councils or (until their abolition in 1929) on boards of guardians. As noted by [[John Wheatley]], \"One of the brightest results of the growth of the Labour movement is that the control of the poor has been passed on into the hands of popular boards of guardians.\" In general, Labour councillors showed more willingness than others in pressing their legal powers to the limit and less concerned about the cost to the rates, and before the end of the 1930s, 60 local authorities were under the control of the Labour Party.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">The Coming of the Welfare State by Maurice Bruce</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Labour councils made great efforts to protect unemployed people from the worst effects of the slump,<ref>Welfare State and Welfare Change by Martin Powell and Martin Hewitt</ref> and sought to ensure that the public assistance system for the needy was made as generous as possible. In Durham and Glamorgan, the Labour administrations paid more than the minimum, while operating the means test more humanely than they were supposed to.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In Hackney, the London Labour Party secretary Herbert Morrison resorted to charitable methods to counteract the effects of unemployment.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/> In Nelson, the Labour council of the 1930s invested in essential services like education and child welfare.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pendlelabour.com/PDF/TheGazetteMay7_1935.pdf|title=Why we did not Celebrate: A Reasoned Case for Reasonable People.|last=|first=|date=7 May 1935|work=The Gazette|access-date=|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402104816/http://www.pendlelabour.com/PDF/TheGazetteMay7_1935.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Glasgow, Patrick Dollan's Glasgow corporation carried out a slum-clearance programme that resulted in the construction of some 200,000 homes between 1934 and 1939. In Barnsley, the school-leaving age was raised by six months in order to promote education and keep some 500 teenagers off the unemployment figure. In addition, priority was given to housing construction and slum clearances.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\nLabour authorities also sought to humanise the services provided by local authorities, to reduce the harshness of the way in which welfare services operated and to enable working-class people to enjoy the benefits of open space and culture. In Norwich, Labour ensured that school architecture was made bright and modern, while the Labour administration in Glasgow put an end to a controversial system in which elderly couples claiming poor relief could be split up into separate hostel units. In many Labour authorities such as Norwich and West Ham, assistance was given to poor mothers as well as the disabled.\n\nLabour representatives on the Boards of Guardians in the 1920s and on the Public Assistance Committees of the early 1930s sought to offset the effects of unemployment and poverty as best as they could within existing structures. This often led to interventionist measures such as the provision of free school meals or ensuring that benefit claimants received the relief that was owed to them. Labour councils sought to administer the means test in the most favourable terms possible, which involved accepting a higher percentage of applications for transitional benefit than in non-Labour localities and providing the maximum rate of relief available. In Poplar, Bethnal Green, and Stepney, for instance, Labour took positive steps on behalf of its working-class supporters, providing protection, jobs, and relief at a time of economic uncertainty.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\nFemale Labour members played an active role in the policy-making of local labour councils, and the extension of accepted (or expected) municipal responsibility brought politics into areas to which women were the acknowledged experts. As recalled by Hannah Mitchell, when she sat on relief committees she \"knew just how much food could be bought out of the allowance, knew the cost of children\u2019s clothes and footwear, could tell at a glance if an applicant was in ill health.\" Through first-hand knowledge of such issues, women contributed to the implementation of reforms which benefited their constituents, such as the building of wash houses, maternity centres, health clinics, playgrounds, and parks. These reforms not only extended Labour's appeal, but also provided women with \"a distinctive place within Labour and municipal politics.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceO\"/>\n\n===Wales===\nThe Labour Party also enjoyed a strong following in Wales, where in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] it won 8 out of 35 seats. In regards to social legislation (including health, housing, and education), the Labour-controlled authorities were both progressive in outlook and generous in spending. This meant that, despite extreme poverty, South Wales (where Labour was strong), had better outcomes in health, housing, and education than other parts of Wales, and this despite the poverty of the councils themselves. For instance, Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, and parts of Monmouthshire provided free school meals, while provision of this kind was exceptional in most of North Wales, Wrexham being an exception. A move towards expanding secondary school places to be filled on merit was also far more evident in authorities controlled by the Labour Party. In the most industrialised parts of Wales, Labour-dominated councils successfully tried not only to increase the number of secondary-school places (even during the years of the Great depression), but also worked towards providing these places free, and therefore on merit, instead of on ability to pay. By 1932, over 60% of places were free, a far higher figure than in England.<ref>Modern Wales: a concise history by Gareth Elwyn Jones</ref> In Rhondda, the dominant Labour council introduced progressive measures such as free milk for children from poor households which helped to counteract some of the worst effects of the Great Depression, while in Swansea, a government grant was obtained to finance a number of civic building projects, the means test was exercised relatively humanely and a nursery school was opened.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\">Labour Inside the Gate: A History of the British Labour Party between the Wars by Matthew Worley</ref>\n\n===London county council===\nThe biggest breakthrough for Labour in local government [[1934 London County Council election|came in 1934]], with the capture of the most powerful local authority in Britain, the LCC. Under the leadership of [[Herbert Morrison]], the Labour-run LCC implemented a wide range of progressive social democratic reforms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A5032|title=What Labor has done for London.|work=fau.digital.flvc.org|accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref> which transformed London into a model of responsible and progressive local Labour government.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> A year after taking office, Morrison took steps to raise the rates of London householders to 31% (seven shillings in the pound), and had run through what was termed a \"nest egg\" of \u00a32,000,000 he had found upon taking office, salted away in London County Council's treasury by Conservatives. This money was used in treating London's poor more humanely, providing more homes for the aged poor, more free education and modernising hospitals, improving patients' diets and increasing their numbers of staff.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883244,00.html |work=Time |title=Foreign News: Egg to Poor |date=11 March 1935}}</ref>\n\nAs leader of the LCC, Morrison presided over the development of London's housing, health, education and transport services, together with the unification of the transport system and creating a 'green belt' around London's suburbs.

An offensive was carried out against London's slums, with new homes built, repairs carried out, and rents reduced for those moving to new municipal accommodation from slum areas. Spending on welfare services, education and health care was increased from 1934 onwards, with more staff employed in hospitals and enjoying better pay and conditions. More free places in secondary education were offered, improvements made in patient care; new schools were constructed, and more amenities were provided, with the initiation of more milk, playing fields, and health visits. The LCC also made efforts to ensure that reforms were carried out to reduce the harshness of public assistance. Morrison's plans for a \"[[green belt]]\" surrounding London also came to fruition, which provided the relevant local authorities with funds to purchase and maintain land.<ref name=\"ReferenceO\" />\n\nServices were expanded under Morrison, with the initiation of new main drainage schemes, more major highways and bridge improvements, and new headquarters and appliances for the fire brigade. The LCC parks were also developed, with Victoria Park in the East End \"transformed with a wide range of facilities\" and other parks got more baths, bowling greens, athletic grounds, paddling pools, playgrounds, refreshment places, gymnasia, and sun-bathing sections. Amenities were provided for children such as entertainment during school holidays in the form of story-tellers, conjurers, and comedians, specially designed saucer-shaped paddling pools were installed to help parents in spotting their children, and special children's lavatories were built to reduce the chance of indecent assault.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' by Bernard Donoghue and G.W. Jones</ref>\n\nIn housing, more clearance areas and compulsory purchase orders were introduced, and new sites were found for building. Also, as noted by a biography on Morrison, the opposition attacked Morrison \"for the deliberate injection of LCC housing into previous Tory strongholds\". The standard of the houses was improved, with more facilities and bigger sizes, and Morrison's administration also scrapped the Municipal Reform tenement where one bathroom was shared by three families. More capital expenditure was allocated towards the LCC housing programme, new flats and houses were built more quickly, and rents were reduced for tenants coming from the slums, \"who often found the increased rents difficult to bear when they were rehoused\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nMore money was allocated towards public health and welfare services by Morrison's administration. [[Somerville Hastings]] had a great influence over health policy in London and was for many years Chairman of the Public Health Committee, which was dominated by members of the [[Socialist Medical Association]].<ref name=\"Pemberton Books\" /> Hospitals were modernised and re-equipped, and more staff were employed, with improved conditions and pay. Patients also benefited from the installation of wirelesses, improved diets, and the ending of patient contributions for the residential treatment of TB. Mental patients were allowed a fortnight long holiday by the sea, and visitors to hospital inmates could have their fares paid.

More nursery schools were established, and special schools were improved, with more aids for the handicapped. More health inspections and more milk were provided for schoolchildren, and technical and commercial education establishments were further developments. Some \"Tory Shylockisms\", brought about by economy cuts, were abolished: more country scholarships were introduced and prizes were restored, while children in residential schools benefited from an increase in educational visits, in pocket money, and a camp holiday each year. Cadet corps for military training were banned from LCC schools, in conjunction with Morrison's belief, as put by a biography on Morrison, that it was wrong \"to inculcate militaristic values into the young\", and school visits to military displays like the Aldershot tattoo and the Hendon pageant were stopped.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nVarious reforms to public assistance were also carried out under Morrison. As noted by a biography on Morrison, the \"barrack-liked\" mixed workhouses were broken up, and children, the blind, the sick, the old, and expectant mothers were treated separately, \"instead of all together in institutions for paupers.\" Conditions for the receipt of relief were relaxed, and a coal allowance was restored. The administration of public assistance was also reformed, with the investigating committees of councillors and co-opted members (which applicants for relief had to appear before under the Municipal reformers) abolished, and in their place full-time adjudicating officers were to interview applicants and take the decisions. As noted by a biography on Morison, Herbert Morrison, \"wanted to streamline the administration of relief and to help the applicant by having his case dealt with by a professional in privacy.\" During his time in office, Morrison was also responsible for the new Waterloo Bridge, the development of the south bank, and comprehensive town planning.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n===Poplar council===\nOne Labour council that acquired great notoriety during the inter-war period was that of Poplar, where the Labour councillors introduced a wide range of reforms including [[equal pay for women]], the introduction of a minimum wage for municipal workers, and improved municipal services and welfare programmes.<ref name=\"Rose 1990\">{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Gillian |authorlink=Gillian Rose (geographer) |title=Imagining Poplar in the 1920s: Contested concepts of community |journal=[[Journal of Historical Geography]] |date=October 1990 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=425\u2013437 |doi=10.1016/0305-7488(90)90144-Z}}</ref> Dedicated to improving the lives of poor working-class people, the Labour Poor Law Guardians paid generous scales of relief to the poor that led them to fall into debt.

In 1921, for instance, Poplar had a rateable value of \u00a34m and 86,500 unemployed persons to support, while other, richer councils could call on a rateable value of \u00a315 to support only 4,800 unemployed. George Lansbury, the new mayor of Poplar, proposed that the Council stop collecting the rates for outside, cross-London bodies. This was agreed and on 31 March 1921, Poplar Council set a rate of 4s 4d instead of 6s 10d.\n\nDespite their imprisonment, the Labour Guardians refused to give way, and were released six weeks after they were imprisoned.<ref name=\"Wood\"/> In addition, the actions of the Poplar councillors in demanding that the burden of the rates be shared more equitably between poorer and richer boroughs led to the passage of legislation which provided for the greater equality between boroughs that they had demanded.<ref name=\"Harmer\"/> Poplar no longer had to carry an unduly heavy burden as all London areas now shared the costs of poor relief in the future.

By the Thirties, for instance, most Labour councils had set up municipal works departments, carrying out repair work and construction without having to use a private contractor. Labour council employees also tended to be paid at (or above) trade union wage rates and were subject to union-recognised conditions. In Poplar, the Labour council that was elected in 1919 immediately agreed to, and increased, a minimum wage for all employees. Labour councils sought to employ direct labour to embark on their municipal building schemes, such as in Wigan, where people who were employed to build the town's municipal houses were subject to trade union pay, conditions, and holidays.\n\n==Wartime coalition==\n[[File:Labour Party membership graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A graph showing Labour Party individual membership which showcase a large increase in membership after the war]]\nThe party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Coalition Government|wartime coalition]]. When [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned in the spring of 1940, incoming-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] decided to bring the other main parties into a coalition similar to that of the First World War. Clement Attlee was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]] and a member of the war cabinet, eventually becoming the United Kingdom's first [[Deputy Prime Minister]].\n\nThe aggressive trade union leader Ernest Bevin, as [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], directed Britain's allocation of manpower, [[Herbert Morrison]] became [[Home Secretary]], [[Hugh Dalton]] was [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] and later [[President of the Board of Trade]], while [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A. V. Alexander]] resumed the role he had held in the previous Labour Government as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Labour also filled eight junior posts, a number which rose to seventeen by 1945.<ref name=\"Pugh\" /> According to [[G. D. H. Cole]], the basis of the Wartime Coalition was that the labour ministers would look after the [[Home Front]] (including the maintenance of important social services and the mobilisation of manpower). Although the Exchequer remained in the hands of the Conservatives, a firm understanding was made with Labour regarding the equitable distribution of tax burdens.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWhile serving in coalition with the Conservatives, the Labour members of Churchill's cabinet were able to put their ideals into practice, implementing a wide range of progressive social and economic reforms which did much to improve the living standards and working conditions of working-class Britons. According to [[Maurice Bruce]], \"for their influence on the shaping of events this might almost be called the third, as it was certainly the most constructive to date, of Britain's labour governments.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAs observed by [[Kenneth O.

Labour also pressed hard for better provisions for the victims of air warfare, for more and better civic and industrial restaurants and canteens, and for war-time nurseries for the children of female workers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''A History of the Labour Party from 1914'' by G. D. H. Cole</ref>\n\nIn a manifesto on \"The Peace\", adopted by the 1941 Labour Party Annual Conference, it was claimed that Labour's participation in the Wartime coalition Government had been effective in that, a year after Labour had joined the government,  the war was now being fought not only with much greater efficiency, but with a higher regard for social equity as well:\n\n{{quote|The area of the social services has been increased.  Largely through the care and determination of the Trade unions, the standard of life has been well safeguarded. The health of the workers has been protected by the maintenance of the factory codes, and by the institution of factory doctors, canteens, and nurseries. Labour, national and local, has taken its share in civil defence; and in every sphere its activities have done much to improve the provision for the safety and comfort of citizens. The social protection of our people has been facilitated by the alert and continuous watch which has been kept over financial policy. Interest rates have been kept down. The Treasury has assumed powers over the Banks which assure their full co-operation in the policy upon which Parliament decides. The dangers of inflation, ever present in war-time, have been kept to a minimum.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />}}\n\nAccording to the historian [[G. D. H. Cole]], Labour's claims were arguably justified: profiteering was kept down, and there was greater equity both in the allocation of supplies and in taxation. In addition, social services were not merely kept up, but also expanded to meet wartime needs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Tom Johnston (British politician)|Tom Johnston]] used his position as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] to push through a range of important developmental initiatives, such as the development of hydroelectricity in the Highlands, while Hugh Dalton's regional policies directly assisted some of the Labour Party's strongest cores of support.<ref>A History of the Labour Party by Andrew Thorpe</ref> The Distribution of Industry Act 1945, pushed through by Hugh Dalton before the end of the wartime coalition, launched a vigorous policy of regenerating \"depressed areas\" such as industrial Scotland, the North-East of England, Cumbria, and South Wales, while diversifying the economic base of these regions. This foundation of this vigorous regional policy were actually laid during the Second World War, with the extension of the role of the trading estates and the linking of the industrial base of areas like the Welsh mining areas with the operations of government ordinance and armaments plants.<ref name=\"Morgan\" /> [[James Chuter Ede]], a Labour politician who served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, worked together with the conservative politician [[Rab Butler]] in drafting the [[1944 Education Act]],<ref>A Century of Change: 1837-Today by R.J. Unstead</ref> while also playing a major role in its passage.<ref>The making of the 1944 Education Act by Michael Barber</ref>\n\nLabour's influence on wartime policy was also evident in the first general statement of peace aims, the Atlantic Charter of August 1941. This included a reference to \"improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security\" which had been inserted by the War Cabinet into a draft prepared by Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill and had actually been insisted on by Bevin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAt the end of 1940, Arthur Greenwood was given the task of planning, in Churchill's words, \"a number of practical steps which it is indispensable to take if our society is to move forward.\" In June 1941, in response to arguments by the Trades Union Congress that there existed inadequacies with the country's system of social insurance, Greenwood set up an Interdepartmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services to look into the state of Britain's social welfare programmes, and see where improvements may be made. Greenwood appointed a Liberal, William Beveridge, chairman of the committee.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nCo-operators, in common with the trade unions and labour, pressed hard from the outset of the war for the extension of the food rationing system to cover all essential supplies, arguing that the existence of an unrationed sector would create class injustices and result in time wasted on seeking supplies from shop to shop. Labour responded to Co-operative demands on these issues in March 1941 by establishing a Food Deputation Committee to work for more effective control and rationing of food supplies, together with the creation of an effective Consumers\u2019 Council.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nIn the field of workmen's compensation, Labour succeeded in getting what Labour saw as an unsatisfactory bill withdrawn, and a new Bill introduced \"to include single persons and to give improved allowances.\" The new Workmen's Compensation (Supplementary Allowances) Act, which came into effect in August 1940), provided a supplementary allowance not exceeding 5s a week to all disabled workers, together with a supplementary allowance of 4s a week each for the first and second child, and 3s for each other child younger than 15. For a man with 3 children, the improvement represented 16s a week. For agricultural workers, a bill increasing the maximum unemployment benefit for agricultural workers by 3s a week was amended by Ernest Bevin, with a more generous increase of 6s a week introduced.<ref>\"Labour in the Government: A Record of Social Legislation in War Time Published\" by the Labour Party, Transport House, Smith Square, S.W.1, May 1941</ref>\n\nA number of reforms were also carried out under the auspices of cabinet member Herbert Morrison. In the area of Civil Defence, rescue services were provided with new methods and new tackle, schools were established to teach rescue men new and safer ways of performing their jobs, and great emphasis was placed on increased training. As noted by a pamphlet documenting Morrison's war work, \"From the local week-end school to the NN.F.S. College and the Civil Defence Staff College he insisted on the necessity of adequate training of both officers and men.\" Morrison is also noted to have worked hard for increases in pay and allowances for Civil Defence and War Reserve police, and in the end flat gratuities were authorised for whole-timers \"who had done such a fine job in the blitz.\" A National Fire Service was also set up under Morrison,<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\">Herbert Morrison\u2019s work in the War Government 1940\u20131945 Published by The Labour Party</ref> which led to improved working conditions such as a reduced working week and higher rates of pay.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F2eGsZBa14UC&pg=PA128&dq=herbert+morrison+wages+conditions+fire+service#v=onepage&q=herbert%20morrison%20wages%20conditions%20fire%20service&f=false|title=Bath Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service, 1891 to 1974: An Illustrated History&nbsp;\u2014 Dennis Hill&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=128|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=978-0-948975-69-1|author1=Hill|first1=Dennis|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of penal administration, Morrison discontinued hard labour, while various measures designed to tackle child problems (such as juvenile wrongdoing) were carried out. The re-war accommodation in Remand Homes was doubled by the addition of 1,000 places, while 3,000 additional places were provided in Approved Schools. In Approved Schools, appointed Welfare Officers were introduced to maintain contact with the boys and girls as they left the schools, while the \"classifying schools\" reform was carried out to ensure that the Approved Schools to which boys and girls were sent to ones which were suited to their needs. A committee was also established by Morrison (in consultation with the Ministers and Education and Health) to inquire into the question of provision made for the care of children deprived of normal home life, while the inspectorate was increased in order that additional attention could be given to Remand Homes and voluntary homes. In addition, a Departmental Committee was established to review \"the question of the salaries and conditions of employment of staff employed both in Approved Schools and in Remand Homes.\" In addition, under a decision announced by the Home Office and the Scottish Office in March 1943, the provision of the Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act of 1939 (which had been postponed due to the outbreak of the war) was brought into operation, forbidding \"any body of persons, other than a local authority or registered adoption society, to make arrangements for the adoption of a child.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nIn terms of the police and probation services, efforts were undertaken to continue the expansion (in spite of an acute shortage of experienced workers) of the Probation Service during the years of the war. Improvements were made in the salaries and conditions of service (with an aim of drawing suitable men and women on their release from the Forces and Civil Defence and industry, while the Probation Training Board was reconstituted to provide better facilities for selection, training, and experience. The Police and Firemen (War Service) Act preserved the rights of constables in the armed forces, while a Defence Regulation was introduced to preserve the constables who had left the service to go into war work. The Police (Appeals) Act of 1943 made it possible(for the first time) for policemen who had suffered reductions in pay or rank to appeal to the Home Secretary, while whole-time auxiliary police were provided with the same rights of appeal against reduction in rank or dismissal. The Auxiliary Police Association was set up to enable the Police War Reserve \"to bring to the notice of the Home Secretary matters relating to welfare and efficiency,\" while the employment of women (both as constables and as auxiliaries) was significantly extended to tackle war-time problems.<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nIn regards to workmen's compensation, various measures were introduced by Morrison to improve provisions for injured workers, meeting the requests of the miners for the inclusion of pneumoconiosis and the cotton trade unions for the inclusion of byssinosis within the scope of the Compensation Acts. A long-standing issue was the case of long-standing injury in which a man was compensated under the old Acts, and at a very different standard of wages than had ruled in his industry since. Morrison tackled this problem by carrying an Act through Parliament in 1943 that helped such cases \"by providing that pre-accident earnings were to be reviewed, if and when a change occurs, after the date of the accident, in the rate of remuneration in the class of employment in which the injured man had been employed.\" This applied dating as far back as 1924, and many long standing cases had thus derived \"substantial benefits resulting from war-time increases the rates of pay of their trade.\" By this means, partial disability cases were significantly safeguarded from a reduction in compensation when rises in wage rates were given in their pre-injury employment. The Act also included a provision enabling the Court \"in deciding dependency to disregard the earnings of the widow from work to which she had been directed, or which she had taken up during the war,\" thereby safeguarding widows whose work could end with the war, and who \"might then be dependent on compensation for her late husband\u2019s accident.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nIn 1941, the annual limit for non-manual workers under the Compensation Acts was increased from \u00a3350 to \u00a3420, while a further Act in 1943 raised the allowances for injured men and their children, and provided (for the first time) an allowance for wives. The maximum allowances for adult dependants of workmen killed by accidents was also increased, together with the total sum payable where adults and children were left. In addition, under Morrison, the Welsh language could now be used \"in any Court in Wales by any person whose natural language is Welsh,\" while the long-standing problem of the Welsh Church burial grounds was finally sorted out. To promote opportunities for women, a female Deputy Regional Commissioner, a Home Office Police Staff Officer, and a Stipendiary Magistrate were appointed for the first time under Morrison's recommendations.<ref name=\"autogenerated1940\" />\n\nThe [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], [[Ernest Bevin]] did much to improve working conditions, raising the wages of the lowest paid male workers, such as miners, railwaymen, and agricultural labourers, while also persuading and forcing employers, under threat of removal of their Essential Works Order, to improve company medical and welfare provision, together with sanitary and safety provisions.  This was important both for improving working conditions and for cementing worker consent to the war effort, and as a result of Bevin's efforts, doctors, nurses, and welfare officers multiplied on the shop floor while there was a threefold increase in the provision of works canteens. Almost 5,000 canteens were directly created by Bevin in controlled establishments, while a further 6,800 were set up by private employers by 1944. During the course of the war, the number of works doctors increased from 60 to about 1,000. This provision, however, was much more extensive within larger factories, with smaller employers continuing \"to barely comply with the minimum provision of a first aid box.\" Accident rates did, however, decline after 1942.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nUnder the Essential Work Orders, provision was made for such initiatives as guaranteed employment, the payment of proper wages, the honouring of wage agreements, and proper welfare facilities for workers.Bevin also encouraged the Minister of Food, W.S. Morrison, to develop communal feeding (especially in factories), resulting in provisions for communal feeding being extended throughout the country. As part of his Welfare Scheme, Bevin introduced various forms of entertainment in the factories, including mid-day canteen concerts. Nurseries were also set up for the children of working mothers by the Ministry of Health (under the recommendation of the Ministry of Labour). For workers who found it hard to get their shopping due to circumstances such as blackouts, special shopping facilities were set up to get around this problem. National standards were also introduced providing proper welfare and wages and conditions for the domestic staff of hospitals and institutions.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Ernest Bevin\u2019s Work in Wartime 1940\u20131945 Published by the Labour Party, Printed by the Victoria House Printing Co., Ltd.

Steps were also taken to ensure that adequate training was provided to the fighting forces and also to repair disabled ships. For seamen, upon taking office, Bevin inaugurated the Seamen's Welfare Convention and hours of labour were introduced equal to those proposed in the Convention. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for miners, including a Medical Service, a Guaranteed Week, a National Minimum Wage, and a National Board. Various laws were also passed under Bevin to help people return to their jobs or trades. The Re-instatement in Civil Employment Act gave the right of re-instatement to all those who had jobs \"whether they had volunteered for Service, were called up as Territorials, or were conscripted,\" while the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme covered those who had been learning their trade prior to their service, which also included people who had been training for promotion and for a career.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\nA bill was introduced by Bevin increased unemployment benefits and extended unemployment insurance coverage to non-manual workers earnings earning up to \u00a3420. National Health Insurance benefits were also increased, while the income level was increased to the same level. In addition, a further Bill raised Supplementary Old Age Pensions and Unemployment Assistance. New Orders were also made governing Industrial Diseases, \"both extending and improving welfare and medical services in these fields,\" while in the field of industrial relations Bevin assisted in the creation of 43 new Joint Industrial Councils. A system of resettlement grants was also established to help ex-Service men and women to either start or restart a business.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\nThe Second World War also saw significant improvements in the position of trade unions, which were encouraged by Bevin. Trade unions were integrated into joint consultation at all levels of government and industry, with the TUC drawn in to represent labour on the National Joint Advisory Council (1939) and the joint Consultative Committee (1940). A similar status was bestowed upon employers\u2019 organisations, which led Middlemass to argue that capital and organised labour had become \"governing institutions\" within a tripartite industrial relations system \"with the state at the fulcrum.\" The elevation of the status of organised labour to one of parity with capital in Whitehall was effectively summed up by Bevin's biographer as such:\n\n{{quote|The organised working class represented by the trade unions was for the first time brought into a position of partnership in the national enterprise of war \u2013 a partnership on equal not inferior terms, as in the First World War.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />}}\n\nCollective bargaining was further extended by Bevin, who radically extended both the Wages Boards (the renamed Trades Boards) and the Whitley Committees, 46 of the latter were formed during the Second World War, and by the end of the war 15.5 million workers were covered by the minimum wage provisions by the Wages Boards. On the shop floor, Bevin directly encouraged the formation of joint production committees to extend worker's participation in industry. By June 1944, almost 4,500 such committees were in existence, covering 3.5 million workers. By the end of the war, the joint production committees were intervening in areas once considered to be the sacrosanct domain of employers, such as health, welfare, transfers of labour, machine staffing, technology, piece rate fixing, and wage payment systems. These developments brought about significant improvements to conditions in the workplace, with a [[Mass-Observation]] survey carried out in 1942 noting that \"the quick sack and the unexplained instability\" of the 1930s had practically vanished. During the 1940s, significant improvements in occupational health and safety standards were brought about both by the rising bargaining power of workers within the older \"staple\" sectors of the economy and the rise of \"the pro-active wartime and post-war state.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nAlso in the 1940s, trade union power and authority was extended further than in British history up until that point, with labour's ability to regulate and control work significantly enhanced during this period. This was assisted by developments such as full employment, the growth of union membership, rising from 32% to 45% of the workforce from 1939 to 1950 and increasing workplace representation, as characterised by the large increase in the number of shop stewards. The progressive social changes were continued in the initial post-war period, with the creation of the Welfare State (which placed a floor under wages) and the extension of the legal rights of unions through the repeal of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act (1927) in 1946, while the 1948 Industrial Injuries Act provided compensation for accidents in the workplace.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nThe war years also witnessed a significant extension of collective bargaining, which was directly encouraged by Bevin. By 1950, between nine and ten million workers were covered by collective voluntary bargaining. Bevin also established 46 new Joint Industrial Councils and extended the coverage of the Wages Boards between 1943 and 1945. By 1950, as a result of these changes, virtually all of the poorly organised and low-paid categories of workers were subject to state sponsored wage regulation and collective bargaining. This transformation in worker's protection and bargaining power had the definitive effect of reducing long-established local and regional wage differences.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nBevin was also responsible for the passage of the Determination of Needs Act in 1941, which finally abolished the long-detested household means test.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> After the passage of the Determination of Needs Act, the Labour Movement continued to press for improvements, particularly for the extension of the principles of the new legislation to cover Public Assistance and other services as well (at that time, it only covered the Assistance Board). In 1943, this was achieved by further legislation, which also improved conditions relating to supplementary pensions. Throughout the war period, the Labour movement (both in and out of Parliament) pressed successfully for a number of changes liberalising the administration of the social services.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe Catering Wages Act (1943), another initiative by Bevin, established a Catering Wages Commission to oversee wages and working conditions in restaurants and hotels. Inspectors were also appointed to ensure that employers complied with Bevin's insistence on the provision of canteens, welfare officers, and personnel officers in factories.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Bevin also did much to improve conditions for those with disabilities, of which little had been done for before the outbreak of the war. In 1941, Bevin introduced an interim retraining scheme, which was followed by the interdepartmental Tomlinson Committee of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the Disabled. According to the historian [[Pat Thane]], the Committee served as \"a mouthpiece for Bevin's own aspirations,\" and its proposals for improving the lives of the disabled culminated in the [[Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944]].<ref>''The Foundations of the Welfare State'' by Pat Thane</ref>\n\nBevin and the other Labour ministers were also able to ensure that, compared with the First World War, there was greater equality of sacrifice within society. Profiteering was effectively controlled, while rent controls and food subsidies helped to keep down wartime inflation. Wartime wages were allowed to increase in line with, and earnings to surpass, the rate of price inflation, while the tax system became more progressive, with taxation becoming heavier on the very rich (this movement towards greater progressivity was maintained under the Attlee government, with the top rate of income tax reaching 98% in 1949). These policies led to a narrowing of wealth inequalities, with the real value of wage incomes increasing by some 18% between 1938 and 1947, while the real value of property income fell by 15% and salaries by some 21% over that same period.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''A History of Work in Britain, 1880\u20131950'' by Arthur McIvor</ref>\n\n==Post-War victory under Clement Attlee==\n[[File:Clement Attlee.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clement Attlee]], Labour Prime Minister (1945\u20131951)]]\n\nWith the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Labour resolved not to repeat the Liberals' error of 1918, and withdrew from the government to contest the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] (5 July) in opposition to Churchill's Conservatives. Surprising many observers, Labour won a landslide victory, winning just under 50% of the vote with a majority of 145 seats.\nThe exact reasons for the victory are still debated. During the war, public opinion surveys showed public opinion moving to the [[left wing|left]] and in favour of radical social reform.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/> There was little public appetite for a return to the poverty and mass unemployment of the inter-war years which had become associated with the Conservatives.\n\nFrancis (1995) argues there was consensus both in the Labour's national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement. The Attlee government was committed to rebuilding British society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. Labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Party's defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Francis | first1 = Martin | year = 1995 | title = Economics and Ethics: The Nature of Labour's Socialism, 1945\u20131951 | url = | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 220\u2013243 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/6.2.220}}</ref>\n\n[[Attlee ministry|Attlee's government]] proved itself to be one of the most radical British governments of the 20th century, implementing the economic theories of Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], presiding over a policy of nationalising major industries and utilities including the [[Bank of England]], coal mining, the steel industry, electricity, gas, telephones and inland transport including railways, road haulage and canals. It developed and implemented the \"cradle to grave\" [[welfare state]] conceived by the Liberal economist [[William Beveridge]]. To this day the party considers the 1948 creation of Britain's publicly funded [[National Health Service]] under health minister [[Aneurin Bevan]] its proudest achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.org.uk/proud/proud_to_be_labour|title=Proud of the NHS at 60|work=labour.org.uk|publisher=Labour Party|accessdate=15 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414173335/http://www.labour.org.uk/proud/proud_to_be_labour|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Attlee's government also began the process of dismantling the [[British Empire]] when it granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) the following year. At a secret meeting in January 1947, Attlee and six cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]], decided to proceed with the development of Britain's [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapons programme]],<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/> in opposition to the pacifist and anti-nuclear stances of a large element inside the Labour Party.\n\nLabour won the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] but with a much reduced majority of five seats. Soon after the 1950 election, things started to go badly wrong for the Labour government. Defence became one of the divisive issues for Labour itself, especially defence spending (which reached 14% of GDP in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]<ref>Clark, Sir George, ''Illustrated History Of Great Britain'', (1987) Octopus Books</ref>). These costs put enormous strain on public finances, forcing savings to be found elsewhere. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Hugh Gaitskell]] introduced [[prescription charges]] for NHS dentures and spectacles, causing Bevan, along with [[Harold Wilson]] ([[President of the Board of Trade]]) to resign over the dilution of the principle of free treatment.\n\nSoon after this, another election was called. Labour narrowly lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|October 1951 election]] to the Conservatives, despite their receiving a larger share of the popular vote and, in fact, their highest vote ever numerically.\n\nMost of the changes introduced by the 1945\u201351 Labour government however were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the \"[[post war consensus]]\", which lasted until the 1970s.\n\n==\"Thirteen Wasted Years\"==\nFollowing the defeat in 1951, the party became split over the future direction of socialism. The \"[[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellite]]\" right of the party led by [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and associated with thinkers such as [[Anthony Crosland]] wanted the party to adopt a moderate [[Social Democracy|social democratic]] position whereas the \"[[Bevanism|Bevanite]]\" left led by [[Aneurin Bevan]] wanted the party to adopt a more radical socialist position. This split, and the fact that the 1950s saw economic recovery and general public contentment with the Conservative governments of the time, helped keep the party out of power for thirteen years.\n\nAfter being defeated at the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], Attlee resigned as leader and was replaced by Gaitskell. The trade union [[Voting block|block vote]], which generally voted with the leadership, ensured that the Bevanites were eventually defeated.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\nIn the decade following the Second World War, Labour councils played an important part in the housing reconstruction that followed the end of the conflict, and stood as important players in the reconstruction of housing and city centres. In [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], under the leadership of the visionary but corrupt [[T. Dan Smith]], an accelerated \"modernisation\" of the city took place, as characterised by an ambitious programme of road construction and public building and the replacement of slum terraces with new innovative estates such as the Byker \"wall.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe three key divisive issues that were to split the Labour party in successive decades emerged first during this period; [[nuclear disarmament]], the famous [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution, which called for the ultimate nationalisation of all means of production in the British economy, and Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). Tensions between the two opposing sides were exacerbated after Attlee resigned as leader in 1955 and Gaitskell defeated Bevan in the leadership election that followed. The party was briefly revived and unified during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. The Conservative party was badly damaged by the incident while Labour was rejuvenated by its opposition to the policy of prime minister [[Anthony Eden]]. But Eden was replaced by [[Harold Macmillan]], while the economy continued to improve.\n\nIn the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 election]] the Conservatives fought under the slogan \"Life is better with the Conservatives, don't let Labour ruin it\" and the result saw the government majority increase. Following the election bitter internecine disputes resumed. Gaitskell blamed the Left for the defeat and attempted unsuccessfully to amend Clause IV. At a hostile party conference in 1960 he failed to prevent a vote adopting unilateral nuclear disarmament as a party policy, declaring in response that he would \"fight, fight and fight again to save the party I love\". The decision was reversed the following year, but it remained a divisive issue, and many in the left continued to call for a change of leadership.\n\nWhen the Conservative government attempted to take Britain into the EEC in 1962, Gaitskell alienated some of his supporters by his opposition to British membership. In a speech to the party conference in October 1962 Gaitskell claimed that EEC membership would mean \"the end of Britain as an independent European state. I make no apology for repeating it. It means the end of a thousand years of history\".\n\nLabour revisionism turned out to be a powerful ideological tendency within the Party in the 1950s and 1960s, taking intellectual sustenance from [[Anthony Crosland]]'s book, ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) and political leadership from [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. Its important intellectuals included  [[Douglas Jay]], [[Roy Jenkins]], and the writers who contributed to ''Socialist Commentary.'' The goal was to reformulate old socialist principles, and bring the Labour Party policies up to date with the changing British society and economy. Revisionism rejected the old view that socialism ought to be primarily identified with the ownership of the means of production.  That meant that continuous nationalization was not a central goal. Second, was a series of political values focused on personal liberty, social welfare, and equality. Themes of destroying or overthrowing the rich and elite were downplayed in favor of government policies of taxation, widespread educational opportunity, and expanded social services. Revisionists insisted on me the necessity of a market-oriented mixed economy with a central role for capitalism and entrepreneurship.<ref>Stephen Haseler, ''The Gaitskellites: Revisionism in the British Labour Party 1951\u201364'' (Springer, 1969).</ref><ref>F.M. Leventhal, ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Peter Lang, 2002) pp 435\u20136.</ref>\n\nGaitskell died suddenly in January 1963 from a rare disease. His death made way for [[Harold Wilson]] to lead the party. The term \"thirteen wasted years\" was coined by Wilson as a slogan for the 1964 general election, in reference to what he claimed were thirteen wasted years of Conservative government.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\n==Labour Party under Harold Wilson==\n[[File:Harold Wilson (1967).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harold Wilson]], Labour Prime Minister (1964\u20131970 and 1974\u20131976)]]\nA downturn in the economy, along with a series of scandals in the early 1960s (the most notorious being the [[Profumo affair]]), engulfed the Conservative government by 1963. The Labour party returned to government with a wafer-thin 4 seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], and increased their majority to 96 in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]] remaining in power until the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 election]] which, contrary to expectations during the campaign, they lost.\n\n===Economic policies===\nThe 1960s Labour government had a different emphasis from its 1940s predecessor. [[Harold Wilson]]  put faith in [[economic planning]] as a way to solve Britain's economic problems. Wilson famously referred to the \"white heat of technology\", referring to the modernisation of British industry. This was to be achieved through the swift adoption of new technology, aided by government-funded infrastructure improvements and the creation of large high-tech public sector corporations guided by a Ministry of Technology. Economic planning through the new [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]] was to improve the [[trade balance]],<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> whilst Labour carefully targeted taxation aimed at \"luxury\" goods and services.\n\nIn practice however, Labour had difficulty managing the economy under the \"Keynesian consensus\" and the international markets rallied against the party. Events derailed much of the initial optimism. Upon coming to power, the government was informed that the [[trade deficit]] was far worse than expected.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> This soon led to a [[currency crisis]]; despite enormous efforts to shore up the value of sterling, in November 1967 the government was forced into [[devaluation]] of the pound from $2.80 to $2.40,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> which damaged the government's popularity to some extent.\n\nFor much of the remaining Parliament the government followed stricter controls in public spending and the necessary austerity measures caused consternation amongst the Party membership and the trade unions.\n\nIn the event, the devaluation, and austerity measures successfully restored the balance of payments into a surplus by 1969. However, they unexpectedly turned into a small deficit again in 1970. The bad figures were announced just before polling in the 1970 general election, and are often cited as one of the reasons for Labour's defeat.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nAs a gesture towards Labour's more left-wing supporters, Wilson's government renationalised the steel industry in 1967 (which had been denationalised by the Conservatives in the 1950s) creating [[British Steel Corporation]].\n\n===Social and educational reforms===\nThe 1964\u20131970 Labour government carried out a broad range of reforms during its time in office, in such areas as social security,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmsocsec/56/9112407.htm|title=House of Commons&nbsp;\u2014 Social Security&nbsp;\u2014 Minutes of Evidence|work=Publications.parliament.uk|date=1999-12-13|accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/6490/1/The_Evolution_of_Disability_Benefits_in_the_UK_Re-weighting_the_basket.pdf|title=The Evolution of Disability Benefits in the UK Re-weighting the basket|work=eprints.lse.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_F8uAAAAMAAJ&q=united+kingdom+A+new+flat-rate+allowance+of+%C2%A33+a+week+for+the+exceptionally+severely+disabled+was+introduced+in+March,+1966.+From+July,+1966,+the+temporary&dq=united+kingdom+A+new+flat-rate+allowance+of+%C2%A33+a+week+for+the+exceptionally+severely+disabled+was+introduced+in+March,+1966.+From+July,+1966,+the+temporary|title=Report of the Annual Conference&nbsp;\u2014 Labour Party (Great Britain) \u2013 Google Books|last=Labour Party (Great Britain)|date=2007-03-19|publisher=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|accessdate=2016-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qkYbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA259&lpg=PA259&dq=harold+wilson+earnings-related+benefits#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20earnings-related%20benefits&f=false|title=The Passionate Economist&nbsp;\u2014 Sally Sheard&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=259|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=9781447314844|author1=Sheard|first1=Sally|year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPxUfFcpxq4C&pg=PA38&dq=Labour+government+earnings-related+benefits+industrial+injuries#v=onepage&q=Labour%20government%20earnings-related%20benefits%20industrial%20injuries&f=false|title=Social Security: Beveridge and After&nbsp;\u2014 Victor George&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=38|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=9780415177238|author1=George|first1=Victor|date=January 2003}}</ref> civil liberties,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JbTbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA489&dq=labour+government+1967+family+planning#v=onepage&q=labour%20government%201967%20family%20planning&f=false|title=British Political History, 1867\u20132001: Democracy and Decline&nbsp;\u2014 Malcolm Pearce, Geoffrey Stewart&nbsp;\u2014 Google Books|page=489|date=2013-09-13|accessdate=2016-03-15|isbn=9781136453533|author1=Pearce|first1=Malcolm|last2=Stewart|first2=Geoffrey}}</ref> housing,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pfp_sdl12MsC&pg=PA75&dq=harold+wilson+rent+act+1965#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20rent%20act%201965&f=false|title=Directions in Housing Policy: Towards Sustainable Housing Policies for the UK&nbsp;\u2014 A.

Notable amongst these was the partial decriminialisation of male [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]], reform of [[divorce]] laws, the abolition of theatre [[censorship]] and [[capital punishment]] (except for a small number of offences&nbsp;\u2014 notably [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]]) and various legislation addressing [[race relations]] and [[racial discrimination]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nIn Wilson's defence, his supporters also emphasise the easing of [[means testing]] for non-contributory welfare benefits, the linking of pensions to earnings, and the provision of industrial-injury benefits. Wilson's government also made significant reforms to [[education in the United Kingdom|education]], most notably the expansion of [[comprehensive education]] and the creation of the [[Open University]].\n\nIn spite of the economic difficulties faced by Wilson's government, it was therefore able to achieve important advances in a number of domestic policy areas. As reflected by Harold Wilson in 1971,\n\n{{quote|It was a government which faced disappointment after disappointment and none greater than the economic restraints in our ability to carry through the social revolution to which we were committed at the speed we would have wished. Yet, despite those restraints and the need to transfer resources from domestic expenditure, private and public, to the needs of our export markets, we carried through an expansion in the social services, health, welfare and housing, unparalleled in our history.<ref>Harold Wilson, The Labour Government 1964\u20131970: A Personal Record</ref>}}\n\nAs noted by one historian, in summing up the reform record of Wilson's government, \"In spite of the economic problems encountered by the First Wilson Government and in spite of (and to some degree in response to) the criticisms of its own supporters, Labour presided over a notable expansion of state welfare during its time in office.\"<ref name=\"FirstCentury\">''Labour\u2019s First Century'' by [[Duncan Tanner]], [[Pat Thane]], and Nick Tiratsoo</ref>\n\n===\"In Place of Strife\"===\nWilson's government in 1969 proposed a series of reforms to the legal basis for [[industrial relations]] (labour law) in the UK, which were outlined in a [[White Paper]] entitled \"[[In Place of Strife]]\", which proposed to give trade unions statutory rights, but also to limit their power. The White Paper was championed by Wilson and [[Barbara Castle]]. The proposals however faced stiff opposition from the [[Trades Union Congress]], and some key cabinet ministers such as [[James Callaghan]].\n\nThe opponents won the day and the proposals were shelved. This episode proved politically damaging for Wilson, whose approval ratings fell to 26%; the lowest for any Prime Minister since polling began.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nIn hindsight, many have argued that the failure of the unions to adopt the proposals of ''In Place of Strife'', led to the far more drastic curbs on trade union power under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\n==1970s==\nIn the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservatives narrowly defeated Harold Wilson's government reflecting some disillusionment amongst many who had voted Labour in 1966. The Conservatives quickly ran into difficulties, alienating [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]] and many Unionists in their own party after signing the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] in Ulster. Heath's government also faced the 1974 miners strike which forced the government to adopt a \"[[Three-Day Week]]\". The 1970s proved to be a very difficult time for the Heath, Wilson and Callaghan administrations. Faced with a mishandled oil crisis, a consequent worldwide economic downturn, and a badly suffering British economy.\n\nThe 1970s saw tensions re-emerge between Labour's left and right wings,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> which eventually caused a catastrophic split in the party in the 1980s and the formation of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. Following the perceived disappointments of the 1960s Labour government and the failures of the 'revisionist' right. The left of the party under [[Tony Benn]] and [[Michael Foot]] became increasingly influential during the early 1970s<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tnvHk8g1crUC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=%22labour's+programme+1973%22 |title=Remaking the Labour Party: From Gaitskell to Blair By Tudor Jones |accessdate=2012-09-08|isbn=9780415125499 |last1=Jones |first1=Tudor |year=1996 }}</ref>\n\nThe left drew up a radical programme; ''Labour's Programme 1973'', which pledged to bring about a \"fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families\". This programme referred to a \"far reaching [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] between workers and the Government\" and called for a major extension of public ownership and state planning. The programme was accepted by that year's party conference. Wilson publicly accepted many of the policies of the Programme with some reservations, but the condition of the economy allowed little room for manoeuvre. In practice many of the proposals of the programme were heavily watered down when Labour returned to government.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\n===Return to power in 1974===\nLabour returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with Ulster Unionist support. The Conservatives were unable to form a government as they had fewer seats, even though they had received more votes. It was the first General Election since 1924 in which both main parties received less than 40% of the popular vote, and was the first of six successive General Elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid for Labour to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, scraped a majority of three, gaining just 18 seats and taking their total to 319.\n\n====European referendum====\nBritain had entered the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1973 while [[Edward Heath]] was Prime Minister.

He was replaced by [[James Callaghan]] who immediately removed a number of left-wingers (such as [[Barbara Castle]]) from the cabinet.\n\nThe party in Scotland suffered the breakaway of two MPs into the [[Scottish Labour Party (1976\u20131981)|Scottish Labour Party]] (SLP). Whilst ultimately the SLP proved no real threat to the Labour Party's strong Scottish electoral base it did show that the issue of Scottish [[devolution]] was becoming increasingly contentious, especially after the discovery of [[North Sea Oil]].\n\n====Economic and political troubles====\nThe 1970s Labour government faced enormous economic problems and a precarious political situation. Faced with a global recession and spiralling [[inflation]]. Many of Britain's traditional manufacturing industries were collapsing in the face of foreign competition. Unemployment, and industrial unrest were rising.\n\n=====Economic record=====\nThe ambitious promise made by Labour in a 1973 party programme was to bring about \u201ca fundamental irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth, in favour of working people and their families.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=73-Trt8fqz8C&pg=PA140&dq=labour+programme+1973+irreversible+shift#v=onepage&q=labour%2520programme%25201973%2520irreversible%2520shift&f=false|title=The Labour Party and British Society: 1880\u20132005|last=Rubinstein|first=David|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=9781845190569|language=en}}</ref> Following an expansionary fiscal policy,<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\">Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974\u201379 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref> as characterised by boosts to public spending,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YamJGlX2_vkC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=denis+healey+1974+budgets+public+expenditure+increased#v=onepage&q=denis%2520healey%25201974%2520budgets%2520public%2520expenditure%2520increased&f=false|title=Good-bye, Great Britain: The 1976 IMF Crisis|last=Burk|first=Kathleen|authorlink1 = Kathleen Burk|last2=Cairncross|first2=Alec|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300057287|language=en}}</ref> more restrictive economic policies were adopted, with expenditure cuts and limits on wage increases. In 1975, for instance, an austerity budget was introduced that reduced public spending for 1977\u201378 by \u00a3900 million, at the expense of about 200,000 jobs.<ref>A history of British trade unionism c. 1770\u20131990 by Keith Laybourn</ref> To reduce high levels of inflation, various income policies were implemented that reduced the real earnings of most workers, with a 1980 Fabian study by Paul Ormerod noting that the attainment of lower inflation doesn\u2019t correspond with a rise in real incomes, as it would take two years (according to the economic models of the Treasury, the National Institute and the London Business School) that workers \u201ccan realise real wage increases through reductions in the rate of increase of prices following heir wage restraint.\u201d Recognising the negative impact that wage restraint was having on the living standards of ordinary workers, the government introduced expansionary budgets in March and October 1977 and again in April 1978, which were partly designed to boost take home pay in real terms via tax reductions. The April 1978 budget introduced a reduced tax rate band along with significant increases in child benefit.<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/> The so-called \u201cRooker-Wise\u201d amendment to a 1977 budget, named after the labour backbenchers Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise, indexed income tax allowances to cost-of-living rises as a means of safeguarding taxpayers from \u201cfiscal creep,\u201d a situation where inflation increases tax bills \u201cby reducing the real value of income tax allowances.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jTtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&dq=1977+rooker-wise+amendment+indexed+tax+allowances#v=onepage&q=1977%2520rooker-wise%2520amendment%2520indexed%2520tax%2520allowances&f=false|title=UK Monetary Policy from Devaluation to Thatcher, 1967\u201382|last=Needham|first=D.|date=2014-05-09|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137369543|language=en}}</ref> Despite such measures, however, most people by September 1978 \u201cwere no better off in real terms than they had been in March 1975.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/>\n\nBetween 1974 and 1977, real disposable incomes fell by approximately 7%, while according to the Family Expenditure Survey, the reduction in the disposable income of families with four children was as high as 20.% Although by 1978/79 the living standards of most household types had almost been restored to the levels they had reached back in 1973/74, this was, as noted by academic Peter Townsend, \u201cscarcely cause for congratulation for five years of Labour government.\u201d The share of government expenditure on goods and services declined from 24.5% in 1973/74 to 23.5% in 1978/79, while total spending (excluding debt interest) went down between 1975/76 and 1978/79 in real terms. Priority services for disabled people and the elderly were cut in a large number of areas while the number of discretionary LEA discretionary grants fell during Labour's latter period in office. While eligibility limits for free school meals had been made more generous, a 1977 price increase resulted in a fall of over 500,000 in the number of children eating school dinners and a rise of about 170,000 in the numbers eligible for free meals but not actually receiving them.<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/>\n\n=====Gains in education=====\nAccording to a study by Tessa Blackstone, Labour did score various achievements in the field of education. Between 1974 and 1979, nearly 1,000 new comprehensive schools were established, and by Labour's final year in office over 80% of children attended such schools. The number of further education courses carrying mandatory awards were increased in 1976. In addition, the amount spent per head rose considerably in the school sector between 1973/74 and 1976/77 (which was especially true of nursery, primary and special schools) and, while there had been reductions in expenditure per head at the post-school stage, there had been \u201ca small improvement in the distribution of resources towards the universal part of the system from which all benefit relative to the selective parts from which only a minority benefit.\u201d Nevertheless, according to the same study, the government failed to ensure that cuts in expenditure growth \u201cdid not hit some areas of education where working class children or adults were most likely to be affected; nor did it make much impact on redistributing existing resources.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/> In the field of taxation, a proposed wealth tax never materialised,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x12mAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT217&dq=denis+healey+wealth+tax#v=onepage&q=denis%2520healey%2520wealth%2520tax&f=false|title=Wealth and the wealthy: Exploring and tackling inequalities between rich and poor|last=Karen|first=Rowlingson|last2=D|first2=McKay, Stephen|date=2011-12-07|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=9781447308096|language=en}}</ref> and in 1977 the number of higher rate tax payers were reduced by a quarter while a further reduction took place a year later following amendments by the Conservative opposition supported by the Liberal Party.<ref name=\"autogenerated1974\"/>\n\n=====Outside financial help=====\nIn the autumn of 1976 the Labour Government under Chancellor [[Denis Healey]] was forced to ask the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for a loan to ease the economy through its financial troubles. The conditions attached to the loan included harsh [[austerity]] measures such as sharp cuts in public spending, which were highly unpopular with party supporters. This forced the government to abandon much of the radical program which it had adopted in the early 1970s, much to the anger of left wingers such as [[Tony Benn]]. It later turned out however that the loan had not been necessary. The error had been caused by incorrect financial estimates by the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] which overestimated public borrowing requirements.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\">Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, {{ISBN|0-333-92908-X}}</ref> The government only drew on half of the loan and was able to pay it back in full by 1979.\n\nThe 1970s Labour government adopted an [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] approach to the economy, setting up the [[National Enterprise Board]] to channel public investment into industry, and giving state support to ailing industries. Several large [[nationalisation]]s were carried out during this era: The struggling motor manufacturer [[British Leyland]] was partly nationalised in 1975. In 1977 [[British Aerospace]] as well as what remained of the [[British Shipbuilders|shipbuilding industry]] were nationalised, as well as the [[British National Oil Corporation]].<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> The Government also succeeded in replacing the ''Family Allowance'' with the more generous [[child benefit]], while the Development Land Tax of 1976 introduced an 80% tax on development gain after the first \u00a3160,000.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tEVbjlUaLREC&pg=PA235&dq=united+kingdom+Betterment+Levy+on+land+1967#v=onepage&q=united%2520kingdom%2520Betterment%2520Levy%2520on%2520land%25201967&f=false|title=Understanding Housing Policy|last=Lund|first=Brian|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=9781847426314|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=====No majority in Commons=====\nThe Wilson and Callaghan governments were hampered by their lack of a workable majority in the Commons. At the October 1974 election, Labour won a majority of only three seats. Several by-election losses meant that by 1977, Callaghan was heading a minority government, and was forced to do deals with other parties to survive. An arrangement was negotiated in 1977 with the Liberals known as the [[Lib-Lab pact]], but this ended after one year. After this, deals were made with the [[Scottish National Party]] and the [[Wales|Welsh]] nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], which prolonged the life of the government slightly longer.\n\n=====Scottish National Party withdraws support=====\nThe nationalist parties demanded [[devolution]] to their respective countries in return for their support for the government. When referenda for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979, the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh referendum]] was rejected outright, and the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] had a narrow majority in favour but did not reach the threshold of 40% support that the Labour government insisted must be met, invalidating the result. This led to the SNP withdrawing support for the government, which finally brought it down.\n\n===\"Winter of Discontent\" and defeat by Margaret Thatcher===\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] had caused a legacy of high [[inflation]] in the British economy which peaked at 26.9% in 1975. The Wilson and Callaghan governments attempted to combat this by entering into a [[social contract]] with the trade unions, which introduced [[wage restraint]] and limited pay rises to limits set by the government. This policy was initially fairly successful at controlling inflation, which had been reduced to 7.4% by 1978.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/>\n\nCallaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978, when most opinion polls showed Labour to have a narrow lead.<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/> However instead, he decided to extend the wage restraint policy for another year in the hope that the economy would be in a better shape in time for a 1979 election. This proved to be a big mistake. The extension of wage restraint was unpopular with the trade unions, and the government's attempt to impose a \"5% limit\" on pay rises caused resentment amongst workers and trade unions, with whom relations broke down.\n\nDuring the winter of 1978\u201379 there were widespread [[Strike action|strikes]] in favour of higher pay rises which caused significant disruption to everyday life. The strikes affected lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers. These came to be dubbed as the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\".\n\nThe perceived relaxed attitude of Callaghan to the crisis reflected badly upon public opinion of the government's ability to run the country. After the withdrawal of SNP support for the government, the Conservatives put down a [[vote of no confidence]], which was held and passed by one vote on 28 March 1979, forcing a general election.\n\nIn the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], Labour suffered electoral defeat to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The numbers voting Labour hardly changed between February 1974 and 1979, but in 1979 the Conservative Party achieved big increases in support in the Midlands and South of England, mainly from the ailing Liberals, and benefited from a surge in turnout.\n\nThe actions of the trade unions during the Winter of Discontent were used by Margaret Thatcher's government to justify anti-trade union legislation during the 1980s.\n\nThe Wilson and Callaghan governments of the 1970s tried to control inflation (which reached 23.7% in 1975<ref name=\"SeldonHickson2004\">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Seldon|author2=Kevin Hickson|title=New Labour, old Labour: the Wilson and Callaghan governments, 1974\u201379|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gmy8wS1bBZwC&pg=PA64|accessdate=29 October 2010|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-31281-3|pages=64\u2013}}</ref>) by a policy of wage restraint. This was fairly successful, reducing inflation to 7.4% by 1978,<ref name=\"A History Of The British Labour Party\"/><ref name=\"SeldonHickson2004\"/> but led to increasingly strained relations between the government and the trade unions. The Labour governments of the 1970s did, however, manage to protect many people from the economic storm, with pensions increasing by 20% in real terms between 1974 and 1979, while measures such as rent controls and food and transport subsidies prevented the incomes of other people from deteriorating further.<ref>The Labour Party: An introduction to its history, structure and politics edited by Chris Cook and Ian Taylor</ref>\n\nAs a means of improving the living standards of those in receipt of state benefits, the government index-linked short-term benefits to the rate of inflation, while pensions and long-term benefits were tied to increases in prices or earnings, whichever was higher (previously, benefit increases were tied only to prices).<ref>A Hard Pounding: Politics and Economic Crisis, 1974\u20131976 by Edmund Dell</ref> In addition, new benefits for the disabled and infirm were introduced whilst pensioners benefited from the largest ever increase in pensions up until that period.

A [[deflationary]] budget in 1980 led to substantial cuts in welfare spending and an initial short-term sharp rise in unemployment. The Conservatives reduced or eliminated state assistance for struggling private industries, leading to large redundancies in many regions of the country, notably in Labour's heartlands. However, Conservative legislation extending the right for residents to buy council houses from the state proved very attractive to many Labour voters. (Labour had previously suggested this idea in their 1970 election manifesto, but had never acted on it.)\n\nThe election of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) veteran Michael Foot to the leadership disturbed many [[Atlanticism|Atlanticists]] in the party. Other changes increased their concern; the constituencies were given the ability to easily deselect sitting MPs, and a new voting system in leadership elections was introduced that gave party activists and affiliated trade unions a vote in different parts of an electoral college.\n\nThe party's move to the left in the early 1980s led to the decision by a number of centrist party members led by the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)#Creation of the SDP|Gang of Four]] of former Labour cabinet ministers ([[Shirley Williams]], [[William Rodgers]], [[Roy Jenkins]], and [[David Owen]]) to form the breakaway [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) on 25 January 1981.

A major effort of the group was to use union block votes to overturn the left's majority on the Labour [[National Executive Committee]] and the [[Trades Union Congress]] general council.<ref name=oxforddnb-ermins>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/96690?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true |title=St Ermins group (act. 1981\u20131987) |first=Dianne |last=Hayter |publisher=Oxford University Press |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk/records/HAY/4 |title=St Ermin's Group, also known as Trade Union Solidarity, 1979-1995 |work=Epexio |publisher=University of Warwick |accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe departure of members from the centre and right further swung the party to the left, but not quite enough to allow Tony Benn to be elected as Deputy Leader when he challenged for the job at the September 1981 party conference.<ref name=oxforddnb-ermins/>\n\nUnder Foot's leadership, the party's agenda became increasingly dominated by the politics of the [[hard left]]. Accordingly, the party went into the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] with the most left wing manifesto that Labour ever stood upon. It was indeed dubbed by the Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] as \"[[the longest suicide note in history]]\".\n\nThe manifesto contained pledges for abolition of the [[House of Lords]], unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the [[European Economic Community]], withdrawal from [[NATO]] and a radical and extensive extension of state control over the economy and financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vaidyanathan|first1=Rajini|title=Michael Foot: What did the 'longest suicide note' say?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8550425.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=4 April 2015|date=4 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis alienated many of the party's more right-wing supporters. The Bennites were in the ascendency and there was very little that the right could do to resist or water down the manifesto, many also hoped that a landslide defeat would discredit Michael Foot and the hard left of the party moving Labour away from explicit Socialism and towards weaker social-democracy.\n\nMuch of the press, particularly the sections backing the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, attacked both the Labour Party's manifesto and its style of campaigning, which tended to rely upon public meetings and canvassing rather than media. By contrast, the Conservatives ran a professional campaign which played on the voters' fears of a repeat of the Winter of Discontent. To add to this, the Thatcher government's popularity rose sharply on a wave of patriotic feeling following victory in the [[Falklands War]] in June 1982, allowing it to recover from its initial unpopularity over unemployment and economic difficulty. Indeed, Margaret Thatcher felt confident to call a general election for June 1983 despite not being obliged to do so for a further 12 months.\n\nAt the 1983 election, Labour suffered a landslide defeat, winning only 27.6% of the vote and securing just 209 seats. This was their worst performance at a general election since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]. Labour won only half a million votes more than the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]], which had attracted the votes of many moderate Labour supporters, although the Alliance only won 23 seats. Michael Foot criticised the Alliance for \"siphoning\" Labour support and allowing the Tories to win more seats.\n\n===Neil Kinnock===\n[[File:Start campagne voor Europese verkiezingen van PvdA (Rotterdam) Neal Kinnoch , k, Bestanddeelnr 932-9811.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Neil Kinnock]], leader of the party in opposition]]\nMichael Foot resigned and was replaced as leader by [[Neil Kinnock]] who was elected on 2 October 1983 and progressively moved the party towards the centre. Labour improved its performance in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102. They were now firmly established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats and it subsequently collapsed, prompting a merger of the SDP and Liberals to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were significant for Labour in the rise of left-wing Labour councils (derided by their opponents as the \"loony left\") which emphasised improvements in housing and amenities,<ref>{{cite book|url={{GBurl|MSPh2KRNhe0C}} |title=Eco-Socialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice |date=1993-08-18 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> participation and rights for women and minorities, workers\u2019 control, decentralisation, and opposition to neoliberalism. The left regarded local councils as part of an extra-parliamentary mode of opposition, alongside community groups and town halls. David Blunkett, once a member of Labour's left-wing, described Labour town halls as \"a rudimentary opposition movement against the ruling party in Westminster.\" The left councils greatly advanced the cause of blacks, women, and homosexuals within the political system, while also opening up council-decision making.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIncreasingly, some Labour councils were radicalised to act in open defiance of the Thatcher Government. Instead of cutting expenditure, they raised rates and all kinds of borrowing and lease-back arrangements were entered into with overseas banks and private financial institutions in order to sustain capital programmes. The increased radicalisation of Labour councils during this period could be attributed to the policies of the Thatcher Government, which involved reductions in government financial aid to both council housing and local authorities, together with a change in the government's allocation formula so that local authority areas of high expenditure were disproportionately affected. As noted by [[Peter Shore]],\n\n{{quote|Since the areas of critical housing need were invariably Labour-controlled, as were the high-spending councils where social needs of all kinds were at their greatest, it was Labour councils in inner-city areas that were targeted to take the full brunt of government expenditure cuts.<ref>Leading The Left by Peter Shore</ref>}}\n\nThe Greater London Council, under the leadership of Ken Livingstone from 1981 to 1986, carried out a number of progressive policies<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Marcy|url={{GBurl|K3er4u_qU9EC|p=PA11}} |title=Democratizing Public Services: Lessons from Other Jurisdictions and Implications for Health Care Reform in BC |accessdate=2013-05-31|isbn=9780886274092 |year=2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Stephen|url={{GBurl|ozVM8IkcPWkC|p=PA237|dq=|q=}} |title=Sexual Politics: Sexuality, Family Planning, and the British Left from the 1880s to the Present Day|date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2013-05-31|isbn=9780199562541 }}</ref> such as a programme of grants to voluntary groups (which cost \u00a347 million in 1984\u201385: \u00a3100 million in 1999 prices) and a \"Fares Fair\" policy, which cut London Transport fares by 25%. Although this policy was controversially ruled out by a House of Lords judgement, it was replaced by a more subtle cheap fares policy before London Transport was removed from GLC control by the government in 1984.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn 1983, The Liverpool Labour party (then under the effective control of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group) embarked upon an ambitious programme of municipal reform. Apart from promoting propaganda for class conflict, as characterised by continual protests and \"days of action\" in which council workers and even school pupils were encouraged to participate, the Liverpool council devoted much time and effort to improving the quality of the inner-city environment. New houses were constructed, while new parks, sports centres,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and other leisure facilities were created. In addition, within a short period of time, 8,000 housing units were refurbished and 4,000 units had been built.<ref>Cities in the International Marketplace: The Political Economy of Urban Development in North America and Western Europe by H.V. Savitch and Paul Kantor</ref> Altogether, the results were an improvement on previous councils run by all parties.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Following the 1987 election, Kinnock resumed the expulsion of Militant's members from the party which had begun under his predecessor.\n\nDuring the course of the 1980s, the GLC and several other Labour councils attempted to promote local economic recovery by setting up a network of enterprise boards and agencies. In addition, the GLC, Glasgow, Liverpool, Sheffield, and smaller London councils like Lambeth, Camden, and Islington adopted policies that challenged the Thatcher Government's insistence on budgetary cuts and privatisation.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\"/>\n\nThe Labour councils in old metropolitan counties of West Midlands, South Yorkshire, Greater London, and Greater Manchester led the way in developing interventionist economic policies. In these metropolitan county areas, Inward Investment Agencies, Enterprise Boards, Low Pay Units, and Co-operative Development Agencies proliferated, while parts of the country such as Salford Quays and Cardiff Bay were redeveloped. The Labour council in Birmingham in the 1980s worked to diversify the business visitor economy, as characterised by the decision to build a new, purpose-built convention centre in a decaying, inner-city district around Broad Street. By the mid-1990s, the success of this strategy was evident by the success of the International convention centre leading to wider redevelopment, as characterised by the building of a Sea Life Centre, the National Indoor Arena, bars, hotels, and thousands of newly constructed and refurbished flats and houses. This helped to revitalise the city centre and brought in people and money to both and the city and the West Midlands region as a whole.<ref name=\"Yeowell Bates 2008\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Labour councils vied to attract inward investment and build themselves up as tourist and retail centres. The relatively left-wing Labour council in Southampton was popular among property developers for its ambitious city centre plans, while the labour council in Sheffield set up a partnership with businesses in order to redevelop a large part of the city that had been abandoned by the decline of the steel industry. Some Labour councils also remedied the neglect of management and service delivery during the mid 1980s under the Thatcher Government and introduced charters and guaranteed standards of service for local residents before a similar \"Citizen\u2019s Charter\" was launched by the Major Government.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn November 1990, Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by [[John Major]]. Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories in the 18 months leading up to Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on the introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. One of the reasons Thatcher gave for her resignation was that she felt the Tories would stand a better chance of re-election with a new leader at the helm.\n\nThe change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 in spite of the continuing recession, although Labour regained the lead of the polls more than once that year. John Major resisted calls within parliament to hold a general election throughout 1991.\n\nThe \"yo yo\" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority, suggesting that Labour could only rule as a [[minority government]] or in [[Coalition government|coalition with other parties]]. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme \"It's Time for a Change\", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule \u2013 which had seen two recessions. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a dramatic change in the change of leader from Margaret Thatcher to [[John Major]], at least in terms of style if not substance, whereas Kinnock was now the longest serving leader of any of the major political parties at the time and was now the longest-serving opposition leader in British political history.\n\nFrom the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 \"Poll of Polls\" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.\n\nThe [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] on 9 April was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21, despite the Conservative mandate being at a record of more than 14 million votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm|title=1992: Tories win again against odds|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for members and supporters of the Labour party, and there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government, just as there had been back in 1959, while at the same time there were doubts with the Conservative Party as to whether a fifth successive election victory was a likelihood.\n\nEven before the country went to the polls, it seemed doubtful as to whether Labour could win a parliamentary majority as an 8% electoral swing was needed across the country for this to be achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/pastelec/ge92lab.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}</ref> When Labour lost the election, there was widespread public and media debate as to whether the party could ever return to government, as had happened in 1959, not least due to the fact that it had failed to beat an incumbent Conservative government during a time of recession and high unemployment \u2013 an economic climate which would normally be expected to result in a change of government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1992_over.stm |title=VOTE2001 &#124; THE ELECTION BATTLES 1945\u20131997 |work=BBC News |accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the party's inquiry into why it had lost, it was considered that the \"Shadow Budget\" announced by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] had opened the way for Conservatives to attack the party for wanting to raise taxes{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. In addition, a triumphalist party [[Sheffield Rally|rally held in Sheffield]] eight days before the election, was generally considered to have backfired. The party had also suffered from a powerfully co-ordinated campaign from the right-wing press, particularly [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper. Kinnock, who in particular had been vilified by ''The Sun'' with headlines including \"Nightmare on Kinnock Street\" and the election day front-page headline \"If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights\", resigned after the defeat, blaming the right-wing media for Labour's failure to win the election.\n\n===John Smith===\n[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] was elected to succeed Kinnock in July 1992 despite his involvement with the Shadow Budget.\n\nSmith's leadership once again saw the re-emergence of tension between those on the party's left and those identified as \"modernisers\", both of whom advocated radical revisions of the party's stance albeit in different ways. At the 1993 conference, Smith successfully changed the party rules and lessened the influence of the trade unions on the selection of candidates to stand for Parliament by introducing a [[one member, one vote]] system called OMOV \u2014 but only barely, after a barnstorming speech by [[John Prescott]] which required Smith to compromise on other individual negotiations.\n\nThe [[Black Wednesday]] economic disaster in September 1992, which led to Britain's exit from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]], left the Conservative government's reputation for monetary excellence in shreds, and by the end of that year Labour had a comfortable lead over the Tories in the opinion polls. Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong.\n\nThe growing strength of the Labour Party during the 1990s was demonstrated by its success in preventing the passage of two major policy initiatives of the Major Government. Plans to privatise [[Royal Mail]] were abandoned as a result of pressure from Labour, the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communications Workers Union]] and voters in Conservative rural heartlands who sought to protect post office services. Another major policy abandonment came as a result of [[Norman Lamont]]\u2019s 1993 announcement that VAT on domestic fuel and lighting would be introduced, starting at a rate of 8% in April 1994 and reaching the full rate the following April. The Labour Party launched a massive public campaign against the controversial tax, collecting 1.5 million signatures on a petition. An important House of Commons vote on introducing the second stage of the tax took place in December 1994. Concerted pressure was put on Conservative backbenchers from marginal seats to vote against the controversial tax, and in the end the Major Government was narrowly defeated, with 319 voting against the tax compared to 311 for. This not only represented a victory for the Labour party\u2019s campaign, but it further demonstrated Labour's social democratic credentials and its growing political strength.<ref>The People\u2019s Party: the History of the Labour Party by Tony Wright and Matt Carter</ref>  During this period party membership increased dramatically, rising from 305,000 in 1994 to a high point of 405,000 in 1998.<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=Membership of UK political parties |url=https://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05125.pdf |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |page=9 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423150318/https://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05125.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2010 |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nJohn Smith died suddenly on 12 May 1994 of a massive heart attack, prompting a [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]] for his successor, likely to be the next Prime Minister. With 57% of the vote, [[Tony Blair]] won a resounding victory in a three-way contest with John Prescott and [[Margaret Beckett]]. Prescott became deputy leader, coming second in the poll whose results were announced on 21 July 1994.\n\n==New Labour==\n{{Main|New Labour}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:TonyBlairBasra.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Tony Blair]], Labour Prime Minister (1997\u20132007)]]\n\"New Labour\" was an alternative branding for the Labour Party, used primarily during the period under [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership. Being used first as a slogan, its first appearance in party literature was the 1996 draft manifesto, ''[[New Labour, New Life For Britain]]''. The rise of the name coincided with a rightwards shift of the British political spectrum; for Labour, this was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of [[Neil Kinnock]]. \"Old Labour\" is sometimes used by commentators to describe the older, more left-wing members of the party, or those with strong Trade Union connections.\n\nTony Blair, [[Gordon Brown]], [[Peter Mandelson]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Alastair Campbell]] are most commonly cited as the creators and architects of \"New Labour\". Blair proposed a rewrite of [[Clause IV]] of the party constitution, abandoning the party's commitments and what Blair referred to as \"state socialism\" (as opposed to [[ethical socialism]]). The party became an advocate of the shift in European [[social democracy]] during the 1990s, known as the \"[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]\". Although this policy was advantageous to the Labour Party in the eyes of the British electorate, it alienated many grassroots members by distancing itself from the ideals of socialism in favour of free market policy decisions.\n\nThe \"modernisation\" of Labour Party policy and the unpopularity of [[John Major]]'s Conservative government, along with a well co-ordinated use of PR, greatly increased Labour's appeal to \"[[middle England]]\". The party was concerned not to put off potential voters who had previously supported the Conservatives, and pledged to keep to the spending plans of the previous government, and not to increase the basic rate of income tax. The party won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] with a landslide majority of 179. Following a second and third election victory in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]] and the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], the name has diminished in significance. \"New Labour\" as a name has no official status but remains in common use to distinguish modernisers from those holding to more traditional positions who normally are referred to as \"Old Labour\".\n\nMany of the traditional grassroots working-class members of the Labour Party who became upset and disillusioned with \"New\" Labour, left the Party and went on to join political parties such as the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]], the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]] and even the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} \u2013 all parties claiming to never neglect the \"ordinary British people\". [[David Osler]], the journalist and author of \"Labour Party plc\" seems to hint in his book that Labour's supposed steady shift from Socialism and its neglect of support for the working-class people of Britain began to show during the Party's years under Harold Wilson. In the book, Osler claimed that the Party is now only a socialist party and indeed a \"Labour\" party in name only and is a capitalism-embracing Party which differs little from the Tory Party. Other historians have also argued that Old Labour's record in putting its social democratic ideals into practice was less successful than comparable northern European sister parties.<ref name=\"Shaw\"/>\n\n===In government===\n{{main|Premiership of Tony Blair|Premiership of Gordon Brown}}\nThe Labour Party won the 1997 general election with a landslide majority of 179; it was the largest Labour majority ever, and the largest swing to a political party achieved since [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]].

{"title_page": "Bra\u0219ov Synagogue", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}}}\n\n[[File:Brasov_Synagogue.jpg|300px|thumb]]\n\n'''The Beth Israel Synagogue in Bra\u0219ov''' (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc), a '''neological synagogue''' in the vernacular language, stands at 29 Poarta \u0218chei Street in the center of [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Romania]], behind the street front, on a plot surrounded by houses. The [[synagogue]] still plays a ritual role. The building complex includes a community seat and a kosher restaurant. Beth Israel Synagogue is included in the list of monuments in Romania under the number BV-II-m-B-11515.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough Jews already lived in Bra\u0219ov as early as the 15th century, they did not get an official settlement permit until 1807. The Jewish community of Bra\u0219ov, which initially comprised four families, was formed in 1826. Initially, they used Chapel Street Hospital, established by Saxon Lutherans, as a religious building. The prayer house relocated to the Lakatos-zwinger area (where the ethnographic museum is today), and a school was established. From 1856, the community's house of worship was in the Joiner-zwinger, at the site of the later reformed church, where the Aro Palace stands today. \n\nBra\u0219ov was the first Saxon city in which Jewish merchants also played a role: They wrote a petition which later allowed Jews to settle in other cities in Transylvania. \n\nAfter 1868 the community became neologic. In 1877 it split into an innovative neologist faction, led by Aronshon L\u00f6bl, and a nationalist orthodox group led by Adler Bernhard. Each community built its own prayer house. The neolog synagogue was built between 1899 and 1901, at 29 Orphanage Street, according to the plans of [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]]. It cost 1.2 million crowns to build, more than the magnificent [[Szeged Synagogue]]. Rabbi Ludovic Pap-Rosenberg inaugurated the synagogue on August 20, 1901; hundreds of soldiers were deployed to maintain order during the ceremony because of the bloodblazing charge.\n\nDuring the first four decades of the 20th century, the city's Jewish community more than quadrupled to 3,494. In 1912, an ITO organization (territorial company) was set up to envision the future of Jewry in Argentina. In 1921, a Jewish sports association was founded under the name Ivria, and soon another was founded under the name Hakoach. \n\nIn November 1940, Iron Guards damaged the synagogue, smashing the vitrals, furniture, and organ. During [[World War II]] until 1944, the building was used as a gym. After the war it was renovated, and in 1949 the neologist and orthodox factions reunited. After the establishment of the State of Israel, the majority of the Jews in Brasov emigrated, and their number in the city decreased considerably.\n\nIn 2001, on the centenary of its opening, the synagogue was renovated again. Because the community had become more orthodox than it used to be, the bane was moved to the center of the main ship by moving the benches and cutting them back. In August 2014, a monument was unveiled in the courtyard to commemorate the Transylvanian victims of the Holocaust. In October 2014, the synagogue was renamed Beth Israel (House of Israel). The community currently has about 230 members. The community's cemetery is on Cri\u0219an Street.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 657 square meter synagogue is built in a three-nave Neo-Gothic style with Moorish elements. Stained-glass windows show the coat of arms of 32 Israeli settlements. The fa\u00e7ade's windows emit sunlight, and the top of the roof represents the stone table of the Ten Commandments.

The [[synagogue]] still plays a ritual role. The building complex includes a community seat and a kosher restaurant. Beth Israel Synagogue is included in the list of monuments in Romania under the number BV-II-m-B-11515.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough Jews already lived in Bra\u0219ov as early as the 15th century, they did not get an official settlement permit until 1807. The Jewish community of Bra\u0219ov, which initially comprised four families, was formed in 1826. Initially, they used Chapel Street Hospital, established by Saxon Lutherans, as a religious building. The prayer house relocated to the Lakatos-zwinger area (where the ethnographic museum is today), and a school was established. From 1856, the community's house of worship was in the Joiner-zwinger, at the site of the later reformed church, where the Aro Palace stands today. \n\nBra\u0219ov was the first Saxon city in which Jewish merchants also played a role: They wrote a petition which later allowed Jews to settle in other cities in Transylvania. \n\nAfter 1868 the community became neologic. In 1877 it split into an innovative neologist faction, led by Aronshon L\u00f6bl, and a nationalist orthodox group led by Adler Bernhard. Each community built its own prayer house. The neolog synagogue was built between 1899 and 1901, at 29 Orphanage Street, according to the plans of [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]]. It cost 1.2 million crowns to build, more than the magnificent Szeged Synagogue. Rabbi Ludovic Pap-Rosenberg inaugurated the synagogue on August 20, 1901; hundreds of soldiers were deployed to maintain order during the ceremony because of the bloodblazing charge.\n\nDuring the first four decades of the 20th century, the city's Jewish community more than quadrupled to 3,494. In 1912, an ITO organization (territorial company) was set up to envision the future of Jewry in Argentina. In 1921, a Jewish sports association was founded under the name Ivria, and soon another was founded under the name Hakoach. \n\nIn November 1940, Iron Guards damaged the synagogue, smashing the vitrals,furniture, and organ. During World War II until 1944, the building was used as a gym. After the war it was renovated, and in 1949 the neologist and orthodox factions reunited. After the establishment of the State of Israel, the majority of the Jews in Brasov emigrated, and their number in the city decreased considerably.\n\nIn 2001, on the centenary of its opening, the synagogue was renovated again. Because today's community is more orthodox than it used to be, the bane was moved to the center of the main ship by moving the benches and cutting them back. In August 2014, a monument was unveiled in the courtyard to commemorate the Transylvanian victims of the Holocaust. In October 2014, the synagogue was renamed Beth Israel (House of Israel). The community currently has about 230 members. The community's cemetery is on Cri\u0219an Street.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 657 square meter synagogue is built in a three-nave Neo-Gothic style with Moorish elements. Stained-glass windows show the coat of arms of 32 Israeli settlements. The fa\u00e7ade's windows emit sunlight, and the top of the roof represents the stone table of the Ten Commandments. Memorial plaques in the lobby list the names of the presidents of the Jewish community and the Jews from Brasov who died in World War II. The main ship is separated by rows of columns from the aisles; these pillars have balconies where women can sit. The synagogue is open Monday through Friday; an entrance fee is required.\n\nThe building complex, at 27 Orava House, includes a community headquarters, kosher restaurant, medical office, and aid organization.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n20140627 Bra\u015fov 158.jpg\n20140627 Bra\u015fov 160.jpg\n20140627 Bra\u015fov 159.jpg\nBRAS-SinanogaNeologa01.jpg\nSinagoga Neolog\u0103 (interior).jpg\nSynagogue brasov inside.jpg\nSynagogue - panoramio (4).jpg\nSinagoga Brasov Vitraliu.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite book |author1=Mana\u021be |author2=Fiul |author3=Oprea |title=Comunitatea evreilor din Bra\u0219ov |year=2007 |publisher=Transilvania Expres |location=Brass\u00f3 |language=ro |isbn=9789738196766}}\n*{{cite book |author=Klein Rudolf |title=Zsinag\u00f3g\u00e1k Magyarorsz\u00e1gon 1782\u20131918 - Fejl\u0151d\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9net, tipol\u00f3gia \u00e9s \u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9szeti jelent\u0151s\u00e9g |year=2011 |publisher=Terc |location=Budapest |isbn=9789639968011}}\n*{{cite book |last=Aldea |first=Vasile |title=Cr\u00e2mpeie din Bra\u0219ovul de ieri \u0219i azi |page=386\u2013389 |year=2016 |publisher=Haco International |location=Vidomb\u00e1k |language=ro |isbn=9789737706416}}\n\n[[Category:Synagogues in Romania]]\n[[Category:Historic monuments in Bra\u0219ov County]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Bra\u0219ov]]\n[[Category:Synagogues completed in 1901]]\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "MichaelMichael10000", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor grammatical improvements", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%C8%99ov_Synagogue"}

The Tories had been a coalition that more often than not formed the government from 1760 until the [[Reform Act 1832]]. Modernising reformers said the traditionalistic party of \"Throne, Altar and Cottage\" was obsolete, but in the face of an expanding electorate 1830s\u20131860s it held its strength among royalists, devout Anglicans and landlords and their tenants.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Arthur Burns|author2=Joanna Innes|title=Rethinking the Age of Reform: Britain 1780-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTmVgdHczd0C&pg=PA50|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=50|isbn=9780521823944}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWidening of the franchise in the 19th century led the party to popularise its approach, especially under [[Benjamin Disraeli]], whose [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act]] of 1867 greatly increased the electorate. After 1886, the Conservatives allied with the part of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] known as the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] who opposed their party's support for [[Irish Home Rule]] and together they held office for all but three of the following twenty years. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s and [[Arthur Balfour]]'s governments between 1895 and 1906 were given the name of \"Unionist\". The Conservative Party was also known as the Unionist Party in the early 20th century. In 1909, the Conservative Party was renamed the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]] and in May 1912 it formally merged with the Liberal Unionists.\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] saw the formation of an all-party coalition government and for four years after the armistice the Unionist Party remained in coalition with the [[Lloyd George Liberals]]. Eventually, grassroots pressure forced the breakup of the coalition and the party regained power on its own, but after the separation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 it increasingly used the name \"Conservative\" more than \"Unionist\". It again dominated the political scene in the inter-war period from 1931 in a [[UK National Government|National Government]] as the main rivals the Liberals and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] virtually collapsed. The party pursued protective tariffs and low taxes during the depression years of the 1930s. In foreign policy, it favoured peace and appeasement of Italy and Germany until 1939. In the late 1930s, it supported a hurried rearmament program to catch up with Germany. The crisis came in 1940 as Germany defeated France and Britain and its Commonwealth stood alone against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The result was a wartime all-party coalition government with partisanship in abeyance. In the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], the party lost power in a landslide by the Labour Party.\n\nThe Conservatives largely accepted the reality of the Labour government's nationalisation programme, the creation of the welfare state and the taxes required for it. However, when they returned to power in 1951 the party oversaw an economic boom and ever-increasing national prosperity throughout the 1950s. The party stumbled in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1975 [[Margaret Thatcher]] became leader and converted it to a monetarist economic programme; after her election victory in 1979 her government became known for its [[free market]] approach to problems and [[privatisation]] of public utilities. Here, the Conservatives experienced a high-point, with Thatcher leading the Conservatives to two more landslide election victories in 1983 and 1987.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the 1980s Thatcher's increasing unpopularity within the parliamentary party and unwillingness to change policies perceived as vote-losing led to her being deposed in 1990 and replaced by [[John Major]], who won an unexpected election victory in 1992. Major's government suffered a political blow when the [[Pound Sterling]] was [[Black Wednesday|forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism]] later that year, which lost the party much of its reputation for good financial stewardship. Although the country's economy recovered in the mid-1990s, an effective opposition campaign by the Labour Party led to a landslide defeat in 1997. The party returned to government in a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] under [[David Cameron]] following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], the Conservatives managed to win a majority and saw Cameron return to power for a second term. The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] saw the Conservatives lose their majority and form a confidence and supply agreement with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]].\n\n==The nineteenth century==\n\n===Origins===\nThe modern Conservative Party arose in the 1830s, emerging from the [[British Tory Party|Tory party]] that had formed about 1812, a key moment of the transition coming with the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834. Political alignments in those centuries were much looser than now, with many individual groupings. From the 1780s until the 1820s the dominant grouping was those [[Whiggism|Whigs]] following [[William Pitt the Younger]]. From about 1812 on the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party called by the historian Robert Blake \"the ancestors of 'Conservatism.'\". Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"Were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism.'\"<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) p. 4</ref> Pitt never used the term 'Tory'. In the late 1820s, disputes over political reform, especially Roman Catholic Emancipation, broke up this grouping. A government led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] collapsed in 1831 amidst [[1831 United Kingdom general election|a Whig landslide]]. Now in the minority, [[Robert Peel]] set about assembling a new coalition of forces.<ref>Ian Newbould, \"Sir Robert Peel and the Conservative Party, 1832-1841: A Study in Failure?\" ''English Historical Review'' 98.388 (1983): 529-557.</ref> Peel issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in 1834 which set out the basic principles of [[Conservatism]], and that year he formed a short-lived government. On the fall of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]]'s government after a [[1841 United Kingdom general election|Whig electoral defeat in 1841]] Peel took office with a substantial majority and appeared set for a long rule.<ref>Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, \"Ideology, party and interests in the British Parliament of 1841\u201347.\" ''British Journal of Political Science'' 33.4 (2003): 581-605.

Peel and most senior Conservatives favoured <!--Not \"favored\" please as this is a British topic and therefore a British English article.--> repeal, but they were opposed by backbench members representing farming and rural constituencies, led by [[Lord George Bentinck]], [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] (later the Earl of Derby), who favoured [[protectionism]]. Following repeal, the Protectionists combined with the Whigs to overthrow Peel's government. It would be twenty-eight years before a Conservative Prime Minister again had a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nFrom this point on, and especially after the death of Peel in 1850, the [[Peelites]] and Conservatives drifted apart. Most of the Peelites joined with the Whigs and Radicals to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1859, under the leadership of [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]].\n\n===Recovery and triumph under Derby and Disraeli===\nThe Conservatives survived as an independent party, even though they would not form another majority government until the 1870s. The modern Conservative Party descends from the Protectionists who broke with Peel in 1846, although they did not reintroduce Protection when they were returned to power. Under the leadership of Derby and Disraeli they consolidated their position and slowly rebuilt the strength of the party. Although Derby led several minority governments in the 1850s and 1860s, the party could not achieve a majority until 1874, after the passage of the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], which broadened the franchise. Disraeli's mixed message of patriotism and promises of social reforms managed to win him enough working-class support to win a majority in [[1874 United Kingdom general election|1874]], but the Conservative hold remained tenuous, and Disraeli was defeated in the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|election of 1880]]. It was not until the split in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] over [[Irish home rule]] in 1886 that the Conservatives were able to achieve truly secure majorities through the defection of the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]]. In 1891, the [[Irish Conservative Party]], which had experienced considerable electoral loses over the previous two decades, joined with other Irish unionist movements to form the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (IUA). The IUA's MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster.\n\nDisraeli provided a widely popular hero for Conservatives, and was much celebrated in the popular culture in support of imperialism for decades after his death. [[file:Disraeli-1929-lobbycard.jpg|thumb|300px|Movie star George Arliss won an Oscar in 1929 for portraying Disraeli as a paternalistic, kindly, homely statesman running a benevolent British Empire]] British music hall patrons in the 1880s and 1890s applauded the xenophobia and pride in empire that were exemplified by the halls' most popular political heroes: all were Conservatives and Disraeli stood out above all, while Gladstone was used as a villain.<ref>Michael Diamond, \"Political Heroes of the Victorian Music Hall.\" ''History Today'' 40 (1990): 33-39.</ref> By the 1920s historical films helped maintain the political status quo by imposing an establishment viewpoint that emphasised the greatness of monarchy, empire, and tradition. The films created \"a facsimile world where existing values were invariably validated by events in the film and where all discord could be turned into harmony by an acceptance of the status quo.\"<ref>Roy Armes, ''A critical history of British cinema'' (London, 1978), pp. 13-14.</ref> Disraeli was an especially popular film hero: \"historical dramas favoured Disraeli over Gladstone and, more substantively, promulgated an essentially deferential view of democratic leadership.\" Stage and screen actor [[George Arliss]] was known for his portrayals of Disraeli, winning the Oscar as best actor for 1929's ''[[Disraeli (1929 film)|Disraeli]]''. Steven Fielding says Arliss \"personified the kind of paternalistic, kindly, homely statesmanship that appealed to a significant proportion of the cinema audience....Even workers attending Labour party meetings deferred to leaders with an elevated social background who showed they cared.\".<ref>Steven Fielding, \"British Politics and Cinema's Historical Dramas, 1929\u20131938.\" ''Historical Journal'' 56.2 (2013): 487-511, quotes on pp. 488 and 509-10.</ref>\n\n==The Unionist ascendancy==\nThe Conservatives, now led by [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], remained in power for most of the next twenty years, at first passively supported by the Liberal Unionists and then, after 1895, in active coalition with them. From 1895, unofficially, and after 1912 officially, the Conservative-Liberal Unionist coalition was often simply called the \"Unionists\". In 1902 Salisbury retired, and his nephew [[Arthur Balfour]] became Prime Minister.\n\nThe party then split on the issue of [[Tariff Reform]]. The controversy had been taken up by the [[Liberal Unionist]] cabinet minister [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who was [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Clarke, P. Hope and Glory, (London, 2004) p. 32.</ref> Like the earlier schism over the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, the result led to polarisation within the coalition between those who supported Chamberlain and [[Imperial Preference]], and those who opposed him in defence of the ''status quo'' and [[Free Trade]]. The split went across both Unionist parties. With the beleaguered Balfour in the middle, the government struggled on for another two years and saw many Unionist MPs defect to the Liberals. These defectors included the future Conservative party leader [[Winston Churchill]] in 1904.\n\n===Early twentieth century===\nThe Conservatives\u2014usually called \"Unionists\"\u2014were dominant from the 1890s to 1906. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of imperialism, tariffs, the Church of England, a powerful Royal Navy, and traditional hierarchical society. There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate that Conservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts.<ref>Jon Lawrence, \"Class and gender in the making of urban Toryism, 1880\u20131914.\" ''English Historical Review'' 108.428 (1993): 629\u201352.</ref><ref>Matthew Roberts, \"Popular Conservatism in Britain, 1832\u20131914.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 26.3 (2007): 387\u2013410.</ref> They had an appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working class Britons in the larger cities.<ref>Marc Brodie, \"Voting in the Victorian and Edwardian East End of London.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 23.2 (2004): 225\u201348.</ref> In rural areas, the national headquarters made highly effective use of paid travelling lecturers, with pamphlets, posters, and especially lantern slides, who were able to communicate effectively with rural voters - particularly the newly enfranchised agricultural workers.<ref>Kathryn Rix, \"'Go Out into the Highways and the Hedges': The Diary of Michael Sykes, Conservative Political Lecturer, 1895 and 1907\u20138.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 20#2 (2001): 209\u201331.</ref> In the first years of the 20th century, the Conservative government, with [[Arthur Balfour]] as Prime Minister 1902\u20131905, had numerous successes in foreign policy, defence, and education, and enacted solutions for the high-profile issues of alcohol licensing and land ownership for the peasants of Ireland.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major''(2nd ed. 1985) pp. 174\u201375</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the weaknesses were accumulating, and proved so overwhelming in 1906 that they did not return to complete power until 1922.<ref>David Dutton, \"Unionist Politics and the aftermath of the General Election of 1906: A Reassessment.\" ''Historical Journal'' 22#4 (1979): 861\u201376.</ref> The Conservative Party was losing its drive and enthusiasm, especially after the retirement of the charismatic [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. There was a bitter split on [[Protectionism|\"tariff reform\"]] (that is, imposing tariffs or taxes on all imports), that drove many of the free traders over to the Liberal camp. Tariff reform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung to.<ref>Andrew S. Thompson, \"Tariff reform: an imperial strategy, 1903\u20131913.\" ''Historical Journal'' 40#4 (1997): 1033\u201354.</ref> Support among the top tier of the working class, and in lower middle class weakened, and there was dissatisfaction among the intellectuals. The 1906 election was a landslide for the opposition, which saw its total vote jump 25 percent, while the Conservative total vote held steady.<ref>Blake, ''The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major'' (1985) pp. 175\u201389</ref>\n\nThe [[1906 United Kingdom general election|election of 1906]] ended in a landslide defeat for the Unionists and their numbers were reduced to just 157 members of the House of Commons. The Unionists had been suffering as a result of the unpopular [[Boer War]], as well as the unpopular tariff reforms proposed by Chamberlain, which faced the popularity of [[free trade]] among the urban population. Chamberlain himself was told to keep his \"hands off the people's food!\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Clarke|title=Hope and Glory: Britain 1900\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hsqAAAAYAAJ|year=2004|page=23|isbn=9780141011752}}</ref> Balfour lost his own seat, although he soon returned to Parliament in a by-election. The severe stroke suffered by Joseph Chamberlain in July 1906 ended his career; the cause of Tariff reform would now be promoted by his son [[Austen Chamberlain]].<ref>E.H.H.

In 1910, the Unionist-dominated [[House of Lords]] rejected the so-called \"[[People's Budget]]\", leading to a long conflict over the nature and constitutional place of the House of Lords. The Conservatives managed to make up much of their losses in both the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December]] elections of 1910. This forced the Liberals to rely on Irish Nationalist votes to maintain their majority. Although the Liberals were able to force through the effective subjugation of the Lords with the [[Parliament Act 1911]], their advocacy once again cost them support, so that by 1914 a Unionist victory in the next election looked possible. Under [[Bonar Law]]'s leadership in 1911\u201314, the Party's morale improved, the \"radical right\" wing was contained, and the party machinery strengthened. It made some progress toward developing constructive social policies.<ref>Graham D.

Nigel Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914, especially on the issue of Irish Unionism and the experience of three consecutive election losses. However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out its positions on the Irish question, socialism, woman suffrage, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. They became the dominant partner in Lloyd George's coalition government following [[1918 United Kingdom general election|their landslide in the 1918 \"coupon\" election]].<ref>Trevor Wilson, \"The Coupon and the British General Election of 1918.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 36.1 (1964): 28-42.</ref> Patriotism appealed to its base in rural England.

From then on the rumblings of discontent within the coalition over issues such as the [[Soviet Union]], trade unions and the Irish issue (leading to the ''de facto'' independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1921) led to many Conservatives hoping to break with Lloyd George. Bonar Law resigned in 1921 on the grounds of ill health and the parliamentary party was now led by [[Austen Chamberlain]]. Previously a contender for party leadership in 1911, Chamberlain was to prove ineffective in controlling his party\u2014even passing up the offer of becoming Prime Minister when Lloyd George indicated he was willing to step down. The party eventually broke with Lloyd George in October 1922 as the result of the [[Carlton Club meeting]]. They voted against remaining in the coalition and Chamberlain resigned. He was replaced by Bonar Law, who had been persuaded by friends and allies to return to lead the party. The [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] collapsed in 1922, and the conservative movement in [[Northern Ireland]] was taken up by its successor there, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). The UUP MPs would take the Conservative whip at Westminster until 1972.\n\nAfter winning the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|election of 1922]], Bonar Law, terminally ill, resigned in May 1923. Though holding a majority in government, the Tories were still split, as many of those who stayed to the bitter end of the former coalition had refused to take office in Law's cabinet. Their absence explains why the hitherto unknown [[Stanley Baldwin]] was to become leader of the party barely two years after first entering a major ministerial post. Baldwin called an [[1923 United Kingdom general election|election in 1923]] on the issue of tariffs but lost his majority; [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed a minority Labour government. Baldwin was back after winning the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]]. His second government brought in [[Austen Chamberlain]] as Foreign Secretary, [[Winston Churchill]] at the Exchequer, and [[Neville Chamberlain]] at the health ministry. Baldwin adroitly handled the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike in 1926]] and passed the 1927 Trades Disputes Act to curb the powers of trade unions. Baldwin lost the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 General Election]] and his continued leadership was subject to sharp criticism by the press barons Rothermere and Beaverbrook.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965) ch. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nThe party reached a new height in the inter-war years under Baldwin's leadership. His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the [[UK National Government|National Government]] for most of the interwar years and all through the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The Conservatives under Baldwin were also the last political party in Britain to gain over half of the vote, which they did in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1931]]. Yet as the war ended in victory the public demanded fresh leadership. The Conservatives were soundly defeated in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 General Election]] by a resurgent Labour Party.\n\n==Post war recovery==\n{{main|Postwar Britain}}\nThe party responded to its defeat of 1945 by accepting many of the Attlee government's welfare state reforms, while offering a distinctive Conservative edge, as set out in their policy statement ''[[Industrial Charter]]'' (1947). Until the 1970s the two parties largely agreed on foreign policy, with both supporting [[NATO]] (1949\u2013present) and the Anglo-American alliance of the [[Cold War]] (1947\u20131989). Economic recovery was slow, however, and that provided the opening for a comeback.\n\n===Popular dissatisfaction===\nIn the late 1940s, the Conservative Party incited growing public anger against [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], scarcity, controls, austerity, and omnipresent government bureaucracy. It used the dissatisfaction with the socialistic and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and to build a political comeback that won the 1951 general election. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced even more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.<ref>Ina Zweiniger-Bargileowska, \"Rationing, austerity and the Conservative party recovery after 1945,\" ''Historical Journal'' (1994) 37#1 pp. 173\u201397</ref>\n\n===Modernising the party===\nThe success of the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was validated by its victory in the 1951 election. It had restored its credibility on economic policy with the Industrial Charter written by [[Rab Butler]], which emphasised the importance of removing unnecessary controls, while going far beyond the laissez-faire attitude of old toward industrial social problems. Churchill was party leader, but he brought in a Party Chairman to modernise the creaking institution. [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946\u201355, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasised a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour.\" The libertarian influence of Professor [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s 1944 best-seller ''Road to Serfdom'' was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) pp. 260\u201364</ref>\n\nWith a narrow win in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], Churchill was back. Although he was aging rapidly, he had national and global prestige. Apart from rationing, which was ended, most of the welfare state enacted by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the \"[[post war consensus]]\", which lasted until the 1970s.<ref>[[Richard Toye]], \"From 'Consensus' to 'Common Ground': The Rhetoric of the Postwar Settlement and its Collapse,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (2013) 48#1 pp. 3\u201323.</ref> The Conservatives were conciliatory toward unions, but they did de-nationalise the steel and road haulage industries in 1953.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

Eden had an immense personal popularity and lengthy experience as Foreign Secretary, and saw the Conservatives win the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|general election]] with an increased majority later that year, but his government then ran into a number of troubles on the domestic front as the economy began to overheat.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393283.stm 1955: Eden given mandate] BBC News.</ref>\n\nIn international affairs the spectacular fiasco of the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 ended Eden's career, but it had little negative impact on the party. The succession was contentious, with [[Rab Butler]] as the favourite to succeed. However, it was [[Harold Macmillan]] who became the next Prime Minister and leader of the party. Macmillan sought to rebuild the government's image both at home and abroad, and presided over strong economic growth and a massive expansion in the consumer-product economy. In 1959 he won the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|general election of that year]] on this economic success, summed up in the slogan \"You've never had it so good\". The Conservatives had now won three general elections in succession and once again they had increased their majority. Such was the scale of their success that there was widespread public and media doubt as to whether the Labour Party was capable of winning a general election ever again.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393287.stm 1959: Macmillan wins Tory hat trick] BBC News</ref>\n\nHowever, rising unemployment and an economic downturn in the early 1960s eroded support for Macmillan's government. It was further rocked in 1963 by the resignation of the Secretary of State for War [[John Profumo]] over the [[Profumo affair]]. In October of that year, Macmillan was misdiagnosed with terminal cancer and resigned.\n\nThe party at this time lacked a formal process for electing a new leader and Macmillan's resignation took place in the week of the annual Conservative Party Conference. This event rapidly became an American-style convention as leading ministers sought to establish their credentials. Eventually Macmillan formally recommended to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] that she appoint the [[Alec Douglas-Home|Earl of Home]] as Prime Minister. Home was appointed and renounced his peerage, becoming Sir Alec Douglas-Home, but was unable to restore the party's fortunes and narrowly lost the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] to [[Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson's]] Labour, who ended 13 years of Conservative rule.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393293.stm 1964: Labour scrapes through] BBC News</ref>\n\n==The Heath years: 1965\u20131975==\n[[File:Heathdod.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Conservative Prime Minister (1970\u20131974) [[Edward Heath]]]]\nFollowing the 1964 defeat, the party formally installed a system for electing the leader. Douglas-Home stepped down in 1965 and the [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election|election to succeed him]] was won by [[Edward Heath]] over both [[Reginald Maudling]] and [[Enoch Powell]]. The party proceeded to lose the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]]. Heath's leadership proved controversial, with frequent calls from many prominent party members and supporters for him to step down, but he persevered. To the shock of almost everyone bar Heath, the party won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]].\n\nAs with all British governments in this period, Heath's time in office was difficult. Furthermore, the Heath premiership remains one of the most controversial in the history of the party. Initial attempts to follow [[monetarist]] policies (later considered \"[[Thatcherite]]\") failed, with high inflation and unemployment blocking Heath's attempts at reforming the increasingly militant trade unions. The era of 1970s British industrial unrest had arrived.\n\n[[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland would lead Heath to suspending the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and introducing [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] as a precursor to establishing a [[power-sharing]] executive under the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. This resulted in the Conservative Party losing the support of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] at Westminster, which was to have consequences in later years when the party found itself reliant on tiny Commons majorities. Heath himself considered his greatest success in office to be the United Kingdom's entry into the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (or the \"Common Market\" as it was widely called at the time) but in subsequent years the UK's membership of the EEC was to prove the source of the greatest division in the party.\n\nThe country suffered a further bout of inflation in 1973 as a result of the [[OPEC]] cartel raising oil prices, and this in turn led to renewed demands for wage increases in the coal industry. The government refused to accede to the miner's demands, resulting in a series of stoppages and massive attempts to ration power, including the \"[[Three Day Week]]\". Heath decided to call a snap election on the question of \"Who Governs Britain?\". However the Conservative Party was unprepared, whilst the miners' unions stated that they did not see how the re-election of the government would change the situation. The Conservatives were further rocked by the death of [[Iain Macleod]] and the resignation of [[Enoch Powell]], who denounced the government for taking the country into the EEC and called on voters to back the Labour Party, who had promised a [[referendum]] on withdrawal. The [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]] produced an unusual result as support for the Liberals, [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] all surged, [[Northern Ireland]]'s politics became more localised, whilst the Conservatives won a plurality of votes but Labour had a plurality of seats. With a [[hung Parliament]] elected and the [[Ulster Unionists]] refusing to support the Conservative party, Heath tried to negotiate with the Liberals to form a coalition, but the attempts foundered on demands that were not acceptable to both parties. Heath was forced to resign as Prime Minister.\n\nThese years were seen as the height of \"consensus politics\". However, by the 1970s many traditional methods of running the economy, managing relations with trade unions, and so on began to fail\u2014or had outright already failed. This was also a period of Labour-Party ascendancy, as they ruled for nearly twelve out of the fifteen years between 1964 and 1979. Many in the Conservative Party were left wondering how to proceed.\n\n==The Thatcher Years, 1975\u20131990==\n[[File:Margaret Thatcher (1983).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Conservative Prime Minister (1979\u20131990) [[Margaret Thatcher]]]]\n\nHeath remained leader of the party despite growing challenges to his mandate, and the fact that he had now lost three of his four general elections as party leader. At the time there was no system for challenging an incumbent leader but after renewed pressure and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|a second general election defeat]] a system was put in place and Heath agreed to holding a [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to allow him to renew his mandate. In spite of his track record as Conservative party leader, which had included defeat at three out of four general elections, few both inside and out of the party expected him to be seriously challenged, let alone defeated. However, [[Margaret Thatcher]] stood against Heath and in a shock result outpolled him on the first ballot, leading him to withdraw from the contest. Thatcher then faced off four other candidates to become the first woman to lead a major British political party. Thatcher had much support from the [[Monetarism|monetarists]], led by [[Keith Joseph]]. The Conservatives would eventually capitalise on the [[Winter of Discontent]] during late 1978 and early 1979, and even in the very early Thatcher era they were able to criticise the Labour government for rising inflation and unemployment, not to mention the humiliating bailout of the UK economy by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] in 1976. However, when the Labour government lost its parliamentary majority in March 1977, it survived a vote of confidence in parliament when challenged by the Conservatives, and then formed an electoral pact with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in order to prevent another similar threat to its power.\n\n[[James Callaghan]] had succeeded [[Harold Wilson]] as Labour leader and prime minister in March 1976, and in September 1978 resisted calls to hold a general election, despite improving economic conditions and opinion polls which showed Labour well placed to win a parliamentary majority. However, this proved to be a disastrous miscalculation by Callaghan, which the Tories took advantage of, as the Winter of Discontent followed and the Tories were ascendant in the opinion polls. A vote of no confidence was delivered against Callaghan's government in March 1979, and the Tories won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] with a majority of 43 seats, with Thatcher becoming Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nThatcher soon introduced controversial and difficult economic reforms in order to solve the crises which had blighted Britain for most of the 1970s. The [[Falklands War]], the perceived [[hard left]] nature of the Labour Party, and the intervention of the centrist [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] all contributed to her party winning the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] in a landslide, gaining a majority of 144. This was despite dismal opinion poll showings for the Conservative government until the Falklands conflict, and also in spite of the [[early 1980s recession]] and mass unemployment. Thatcher's monetarist policies had a positive effect in the battle against inflation, which dropped from 27% in 1979 to less than 10% by 1982 and down to 4% by 1983.\n\nThatcher won a third successive election in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], this time with a 102-seat majority. Unemployment had now fallen below 3 million for the first time since 1981, and the economy was continuing to improve.\n\nThe second and third terms were dominated by privatisations of Britain's many state-owned industries, including [[British Telecom]] in 1984, the bus companies in 1985, [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] in 1986, [[British Airways]] in 1987, [[Austin Rover]] (formerly [[British Leyland]]), and [[British Steel Corporation]] in 1988. In 1984, Thatcher also successfully concluded five-year-long negotiations over Britain's budget to the [[European Community|European Economic Community]]. (''See [[UK rebate]]''.)\n\nIn 1989, the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (frequently referred to as the \"[[Tax per head|poll tax]]\") was introduced to replace the ancient system of rates (based on property values) which funded local government. This unpopular new charge was a flat rate per adult no matter what their circumstances; it seemed to be shifting the tax burden disproportionately onto the poor. Once again Thatcher's popularity sagged, but this time the Conservatives thought it might cost them the election. [[Michael Heseltine]], a former cabinet member, challenged her for the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership in November 1990]]. She won the first round, but not enough to win outright, and having initially announced her intention to \"fight on and fight to win\" she resigned after it was clear the cabinet wouldn't back her she announced her intention to stand down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2549000/2549189.stm|title=1990: Thatcher quits as prime minister|work=BBC on this day|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> This signalled the end of her time in office on 22 November 1990 after 11 years as prime minister\u2014a longer spell in power than any prime minister of the 20th century. In the ensuing second ballot, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Major]] beat Heseltine and [[Douglas Hurd]]. Thatcher continued to sit in parliament as an MP until the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], when she stepped down from parliament after 33 years.\n\n==The Major years: 1990\u20131997==\n[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Conservative Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) [[John Major]]]]\n\nMajor introduced a replacement for the Community Charge, the [[Council Tax]], and continued with the privatisations, and went on to narrowly win the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]] with a majority of 21.\n\nMajor's government was beset by scandals, crisis, and missteps. Many of the scandals were about the personal lives of politicians which the media construed as hypocrisy, but the [[Cash for Questions]] affair and the divisions over [[European Union|EU]] were substantive. In 1995, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party in order to trigger [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|a leadership election]] which he hoped would give him a renewed mandate, and quieten the Maastricht rebels (e.g. [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Bill Cash]], [[Bernard Jenkin]]). [[John Redwood]], then Secretary of State for Wales, stood against Major and gained around a fifth of the leadership vote. He was one of the people whom Major inadvertently referred to as 'bastards' during a television interview. Major was pleased that [[Michael Heseltine]] had not stood against him and gave him the position of [[Deputy Prime Minister]] as a result.\n\nAs the term went on, with by-elections being consistently lost by the Conservatives, their majority declined and eventually vanished entirely. Getting every vote out became increasingly important to both sides, and on several occasions ill MPs were wheeled into the [[British House of Commons|Commons]] to vote. Eventually, the Government became a technical minority.\n\nAs predicted, the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election of May 1997]] was a win for the Labour Party, but the magnitude of the victory surprised almost everyone. There was a swing of 20% in some places, and Labour achieved a majority of 179 with 43% of the vote to the Conservatives' 31%. [[Tactical voting]] against the Conservatives is believed to have caused around 40 seats to change hands. They lost all their seats outside England, with prominent members such as [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Malcolm Rifkind]] among the losses. Major resigned within 24 hours.\n\nIt is often said that the Conservatives lost the 1997 election due to EU party-policy divisions. However, it is likely that the European question played only a small or insignificant part in the result. Accusations of \"Tory sleaze\", apathy towards a government that had been in power for nearly two decades, and a rebranded \"New\" Labour Party with a dynamic and charismatic leader ([[Tony Blair]]) are all probable factors in the Conservative defeat.\n\n===Tory \"sleaze\"===\nA number of [[British political scandals|political scandal]]s in the 1990s (building on previous examples in the 1980s) created the impression of what is described in the British press as \"sleaze\": a perception, peaking towards the end of the Major era, that the Conservatives were associated with [[political corruption]] and [[hypocrisy]]. In particular the successful entrapment of [[Graham Riddick]] and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] in the \"cash for questions\" scandal, the contemporaneous misconduct as a minister by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] (who lost a consequent libel action against ''The Guardian''), and the convictions of former Cabinet member [[Jonathan Aitken]] and former party deputy chairman [[Jeffrey Archer]] for [[perjury]] in two separate cases leading to custodial sentences damaged the Conservatives' public reputation. Persistent unsubstantiated rumours about the activities of the party treasurer [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Michael Ashcroft]] did not help this impression.\n\nAt the same time a series of revelations about the private lives of various Conservative politicians also grabbed the headlines and both the media and the party's opponents made little attempt to clarify the distinction between financial conduct and private lives.\n\n[[John Major]]'s \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" morality campaign back-fired on him by providing an excuse for the British media to expose \"sleaze\" within the Conservative Party and, most damagingly, within the Cabinet itself. A number of ministers were then revealed to have committed sexual indiscretions, and Major was forced by media pressure to dismiss them. In September 2002 it was revealed that, prior to his promotion to the cabinet, Major had himself had a longstanding extramarital affair with a fellow MP, [[Edwina Currie]].\n\n==William Hague: 1997\u20132001==\nThe [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|ensuing leadership election]] was contested by five candidates. The electorate for the contest consisted solely of the 165 Conservative MPs who had been returned to the House of Commons. The candidates were [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[William Hague]], [[John Redwood]], [[Peter Lilley]] and [[Michael Howard]], with [[Stephen Dorrell]] launching an initial bid but withdrawing before polling began, citing limited support, and backing Clarke. Clarke was the favoured candidate of the [[Europhile]] left of the party, while the three latter candidates divided right-wing support roughly equally. Hague, who had initially supported Howard, emerged second as a compromise candidate and won the final ballot after Redwood and Clarke negotiated a joint ticket which was derided as an ''Instability Pact'' by their opponents (punning on the economic Stability Pact of the [[European Community]]).\n\nAt first William Hague portrayed himself as a moderniser with a common touch. However, by the time the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] came he concentrated on Europe, asylum seekers and tax cuts whilst declaring that only the Conservative Party could \"Save the Pound\". Though a master debater who would regularly trounce Tony Blair in the Commons,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} his leadership tenure was beset by poor publicity and stumbles. Despite a low turnout, the election resulted in a net gain of a single seat for the Conservative Party and William Hague's resignation as party leader.\n\n==Iain Duncan Smith: 2001\u20132003==\nThe [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|2001 leadership election]] was conducted under a new leadership electoral system designed by Hague. This resulted in five candidates competing for the job: [[Michael Portillo]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] and [[Michael Ancram]]. The drawn-out and at times acrimonious election saw Conservative MPs select Iain Duncan Smith and Ken Clarke to be put forward for a vote by party members. As Conservative Party members are characteristically Eurosceptic, Iain Duncan Smith was elected, even though opinion polls showed that the public preferred Ken Clarke, a member of the [[Tory Reform Group]]. (''Main article: [[2001 Conservative leadership election]].'')\n\nIain Duncan Smith (often known as IDS) was a strong [[euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] but this did not define his leadership \u2013 indeed it was during his tenure that Europe ceased to be an issue of division in the party as it united behind calls for a referendum on the proposed [[European Union Constitution]]. Duncan Smith's [[Shadow Cabinet]] contained many new and unfamiliar faces but despite predictions by some that the party would lurch to the right the team instead followed a pragmatic moderate approach to policy.\n\nOn 27 October Iain Duncan Smith began to face calls within his own party to either resign as leader or face a [[vote of confidence]]. Under the rules of the Conservative party, the backbench [[Conservative 1922 Committee]] would review the leadership, and in order for this to take place the chairman of the committee, Sir [[Michael Spicer, Baron Spicer|Michael Spicer]] must be presented with 25 letters proposing a vote.\n\nOn 28 October sufficient letters were presented to the chairman of the 1922 Committee to initiate a vote of confidence in Iain Duncan Smith. The vote came on 29 October, and IDS lost 90 to 75.\n\n==Michael Howard: 2003\u20132005==\nDuncan Smith remained as caretaker leader until [[Michael Howard]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Folkestone]] and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], was [[2003 Conservative Party leadership election|elected to the post of leader]] (as the only candidate) on 6 November 2003.\n\nHoward announced radical changes to the way the [[Shadow Cabinet]] would work. He slashed the number of members by half, with [[Theresa May]] and [[Tim Yeo]] each shadowing two government departments. Minor departments still have shadows but have been removed from the cabinet, and the post of Shadow Leader of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was abolished. The role of party chairman was also split into two, with [[Lord Saatchi]] responsible for the party machine, and [[Liam Fox]] handling publicity. [[Michael Portillo]] was offered a position but refused, due to his plans to step down from Parliament at the next election.\n\nAlso, a panel of \"grandees\", including [[John Major]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[William Hague]] and, notably, [[Kenneth Clarke]] has been set up to advise the leadership as they see fit.\n\nOn 2 January 2004, influenced by Saatchi, Howard defined a personal credo and [[list of the core beliefs of the Conservative Party of 2004|list of core beliefs of the party]]. At the party conference of October 2004, the Conservatives presented their \"[[Timetable For Action]]\" that a Conservative government would follow.\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:New-conservative-logo.png|thumb|right|The logo of the Conservative Party during the Howard years]] -->\nIn the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], the Conservative Party made a partial recovery by a net gain of 31 seats, with the Labour majority falling to 66.\n\nThe day after, on 6 May, Howard announced that he believed himself too old to lead the party into another election campaign, and he would therefore be stepping down to allow a new leader the time to prepare for the next election. Howard said that he believed that the party needed to amend the rules governing the election of the Party leader, and that he would allow time for that to happen before resigning.

Cameron beat his closest rival [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] by a margin of more than two to one, taking 134,446 votes to 64,398, and announced his intention to reform and realign the Conservative Party in a manner similar to that achieved by the Labour Party in opposition under Tony Blair. As part of this he distanced from himself from the much hated Conservative Party of the past, for example apologising for [[Section 28]], and focused in on modern environmental issues.\n\nIn April 2006 the party set out to deliver a promise by Cameron to modernise its parliamentary representation.

After undertaking a renegotiation of Britain's membership with the EU, the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] was called for 23 June 2016 and resulted in a vote to leave the EU by 52%.

After Gove too was eliminated from the contest Leadsom, a junior minister with little experience, caused controversy by claiming she had more of a stake in the future of society than May because she had children when the latter was medically unable to have children. Leadsom subsequently withdrew from the contest, citing a lack of support within the party.\n\nIn her first speech after taking office, May vowed to tackle injustice and social mobility, seen by many as a departure from the Thatcherite consensus that had been continued by her predecessor. She vowed to legislate for the expansion of selective Grammar schools, peg the pay of top executives to those on the lowest wages in big companies whilst bringing an end to the austerity agenda which dominated the previous administration.\n\nAlthough she supported remain in the EU referendum, she appointed several leave supporters to the cabinet in a wide-ranging shake up including [[Boris Johnson]] as [[UK Foreign Secretary|Foreign Secretary]] and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] as [[Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union|Secretary of State for Leaving the EU]] in a bid to unify the party.

The Tories had been a coalition that more often than not formed the government from 1760 until the [[Reform Act 1832]]. Modernising reformers said the traditionalistic party of \"Throne, Altar and Cottage\" was obsolete, but in the face of an expanding electorate 1830s\u20131860s it held its strength among royalists, devout Anglicans and landlords and their tenants.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Arthur Burns|author2=Joanna Innes|title=Rethinking the Age of Reform: Britain 1780-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTmVgdHczd0C&pg=PA50|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=50|isbn=9780521823944}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWidening of the franchise in the 19th century led the party to popularise its approach, especially under [[Benjamin Disraeli]], whose [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act]] of 1867 greatly increased the electorate. After 1886, the Conservatives allied with the part of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] known as the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] who opposed their party's support for [[Irish Home Rule]] and together they held office for all but three of the following twenty years. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s and [[Arthur Balfour]]'s governments between 1895 and 1906 were given the name of \"Unionist\". The Conservative Party was also known as the Unionist Party in the early 20th century. In 1909, the Conservative Party was renamed the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]] and in May 1912 it formally merged with the Liberal Unionists.\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] saw the formation of an all-party coalition government and for four years after the armistice the Unionist Party remained in coalition with the [[Lloyd George Liberals]]. Eventually, grassroots pressure forced the breakup of the coalition and the party regained power on its own, but after the separation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 it increasingly used the name \"Conservative\" more than \"Unionist\". It again dominated the political scene in the inter-war period from 1931 in a [[UK National Government|National Government]] as the main rivals the Liberals and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] virtually collapsed. The party pursued protective tariffs and low taxes during the depression years of the 1930s. In foreign policy, it favoured peace and appeasement of Italy and Germany until 1939. In the late 1930s, it supported a hurried rearmament program to catch up with Germany. The crisis came in 1940 as Germany defeated France and Britain and its Commonwealth stood alone against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The result was a wartime all-party coalition government with partisanship in abeyance. In the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], the party lost power in a landslide by the Labour Party.\n\nThe Conservatives largely accepted the reality of the Labour government's nationalisation programme, the creation of the welfare state and the taxes required for it. However, when they returned to power in 1951 the party oversaw an economic boom and ever-increasing national prosperity throughout the 1950s. The party stumbled in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1975 [[Margaret Thatcher]] became leader and converted it to a monetarist economic programme; after her election victory in 1979 her government became known for its [[free market]] approach to problems and [[privatisation]] of public utilities. Here, the Conservatives experienced a high-point, with Thatcher leading the Conservatives to two more landslide election victories in 1983 and 1987.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the 1980s Thatcher's increasing unpopularity within the parliamentary party and unwillingness to change policies perceived as vote-losing led to her being deposed in 1990 and replaced by [[John Major]], who won an unexpected election victory in 1992. Major's government suffered a political blow when the [[Pound Sterling]] was [[Black Wednesday|forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism]] later that year, which lost the party much of its reputation for good financial stewardship. Although the country's economy recovered in the mid-1990s, an effective opposition campaign by the Labour Party led to a landslide defeat in 1997. The party returned to government in a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] under [[David Cameron]] following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], the Conservatives managed to win a majority and saw Cameron return to power for a second term. The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] saw the Conservatives lose their majority and form a confidence and supply agreement with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]].\n\n==The nineteenth century==\n\n===Origins===\nThe modern Conservative Party arose in the 1830s, emerging from the [[British Tory Party|Tory party]] that had formed about 1812, a key moment of the transition coming with the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834. Political alignments in those centuries were much looser than now, with many individual groupings. From the 1780s until the 1820s the dominant grouping was those [[Whiggism|Whigs]] following [[William Pitt the Younger]]. From about 1812 on the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party called by the historian Robert Blake \"the ancestors of 'Conservatism.'\". Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"Were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism.'\"<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) p. 4</ref> Pitt never used the term 'Tory'. In the late 1820s, disputes over political reform, especially Roman Catholic Emancipation, broke up this grouping. A government led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] collapsed in 1831 amidst [[1831 United Kingdom general election|a Whig landslide]]. Now in the minority, [[Robert Peel]] set about assembling a new coalition of forces.<ref>Ian Newbould, \"Sir Robert Peel and the Conservative Party, 1832-1841: A Study in Failure?\" ''English Historical Review'' 98.388 (1983): 529-557.</ref> Peel issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in 1834 which set out the basic principles of [[Conservatism]], and that year he formed a short-lived government. On the fall of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]]'s government after a [[1841 United Kingdom general election|Whig electoral defeat in 1841]] Peel took office with a substantial majority and appeared set for a long rule.<ref>Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, \"Ideology, party and interests in the British Parliament of 1841\u201347.\" ''British Journal of Political Science'' 33.4 (2003): 581-605.

Peel and most senior Conservatives favoured <!--Not \"favored\" please as this is a British topic and therefore a British English article.--> repeal, but they were opposed by backbench members representing farming and rural constituencies, led by [[Lord George Bentinck]], [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] (later the Earl of Derby), who favoured [[protectionism]]. Following repeal, the Protectionists combined with the Whigs to overthrow Peel's government. It would be twenty-eight years before a Conservative Prime Minister again had a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nFrom this point on, and especially after the death of Peel in 1850, the [[Peelites]] and Conservatives drifted apart. Most of the Peelites joined with the Whigs and Radicals to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1859, under the leadership of [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]].\n\n===Recovery and triumph under Derby and Disraeli===\nThe Conservatives survived as an independent party, even though they would not form another majority government until the 1870s. The modern Conservative Party descends from the Protectionists who broke with Peel in 1846, although they did not reintroduce Protection when they were returned to power. Under the leadership of Derby and Disraeli they consolidated their position and slowly rebuilt the strength of the party. Although Derby led several minority governments in the 1850s and 1860s, the party could not achieve a majority until 1874, after the passage of the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], which broadened the franchise. Disraeli's mixed message of patriotism and promises of social reforms managed to win him enough working-class support to win a majority in [[1874 United Kingdom general election|1874]], but the Conservative hold remained tenuous, and Disraeli was defeated in the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|election of 1880]]. It was not until the split in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] over [[Irish home rule]] in 1886 that the Conservatives were able to achieve truly secure majorities through the defection of the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]]. In 1891, the [[Irish Conservative Party]], which had experienced considerable electoral loses over the previous two decades, joined with other Irish unionist movements to form the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (IUA). The IUA's MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster.\n\nDisraeli provided a widely popular hero for Conservatives, and was much celebrated in the popular culture in support of imperialism for decades after his death.

From 1895, unofficially, and after 1912 officially, the Conservative-Liberal Unionist coalition was often simply called the \"Unionists\". In 1902 Salisbury retired, and his nephew [[Arthur Balfour]] became Prime Minister.\n\nThe party then split on the issue of [[Tariff Reform]]. The controversy had been taken up by the [[Liberal Unionist]] cabinet minister [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who was [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Clarke, P. Hope and Glory, (London, 2004) p. 32.</ref> Like the earlier schism over the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, the result led to polarisation within the coalition between those who supported Chamberlain and [[Imperial Preference]], and those who opposed him in defence of the ''status quo'' and [[Free Trade]]. The split went across both Unionist parties. With the beleaguered Balfour in the middle, the government struggled on for another two years and saw many Unionist MPs defect to the Liberals. These defectors included the future Conservative party leader [[Winston Churchill]] in 1904.\n\n===Early twentieth century===\nThe Conservatives\u2014usually called \"Unionists\"\u2014were dominant from the 1890s to 1906. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of imperialism, tariffs, the Church of England, a powerful Royal Navy, and traditional hierarchical society. There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests.

Tariff reform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung to.<ref>Andrew S.

In 1910, the Unionist-dominated [[House of Lords]] rejected the so-called \"[[People's Budget]]\", leading to a long conflict over the nature and constitutional place of the House of Lords. The Conservatives managed to make up much of their losses in both the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December]] elections of 1910. This forced the Liberals to rely on Irish Nationalist votes to maintain their majority. Although the Liberals were able to force through the effective subjugation of the Lords with the [[Parliament Act 1911]], their advocacy once again cost them support, so that by 1914 a Unionist victory in the next election looked possible. Under [[Bonar Law]]'s leadership in 1911-14, the Party's morale improved, the \"radical right\" wing was contained, and the party machinery strengthened. It made some progress toward developing constructive social policies.<ref>Graham D.

Nigel Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914, especially on the issue of Irish Unionism and the experience of three consecutive election losses. However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out its positions on the Irish question, socialism, woman suffrage, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. They became the dominant partner in Lloyd George's coalition government following [[1918 United Kingdom general election|their landslide in the 1918 \"coupon\" election]].<ref>Trevor Wilson, \"The Coupon and the British General Election of 1918.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 36.1 (1964): 28-42.</ref> Patriotism appealed to its base in rural England.

From then on the rumblings of discontent within the coalition over issues such as the [[Soviet Union]], trade unions and the Irish issue (leading to the ''de facto'' independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1921) led to many Conservatives hoping to break with Lloyd George. Bonar Law resigned in 1921 on the grounds of ill health and the parliamentary party was now led by [[Austen Chamberlain]]. Previously a contender for party leadership in 1911, Chamberlain was to prove ineffective in controlling his party\u2014even passing up the offer of becoming Prime Minister when Lloyd George indicated he was willing to step down. The party eventually broke with Lloyd George in October 1922 as the result of the [[Carlton Club meeting]]. They voted against remaining in the coalition and Chamberlain resigned. He was replaced by Bonar Law, who had been persuaded by friends and allies to return to lead the party. The [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] collapsed in 1922, and the conservative movement in [[Northern Ireland]] was taken up by its successor there, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). The UUP MPs would take the Conservative whip at Westminster until 1972.\n\nAfter winning the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|election of 1922]], Bonar Law, terminally ill, resigned in May 1923. Though holding a majority in government, the Tories were still split, as many of those who stayed to the bitter end of the former coalition had refused to take office in Law's cabinet. Their absence explains why the hitherto unknown [[Stanley Baldwin]] was to become leader of the party barely two years after first entering a major ministerial post. Baldwin called an [[1923 United Kingdom general election|election in 1923]] on the issue of tariffs but lost his majority; [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed a minority Labour government. Baldwin was back after winning the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]]. His second government brought in [[Austen Chamberlain]] as Foreign Secretary, [[Winston Churchill]] at the Exchequer, and [[Neville Chamberlain]] at the health ministry. Baldwin adroitly handled the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike in 1926]] and passed the 1927 Trades Disputes Act to curb the powers of trade unions. Baldwin lost the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 General Election]] and his continued leadership was subject to sharp criticism by the press barons Rothermere and Beaverbrook.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965) ch. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nThe party reached a new height in the inter-war years under Baldwin's leadership. His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the [[UK National Government|National Government]] for most of the interwar years and all through the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The Conservatives under Baldwin were also the last political party in Britain to gain over half of the vote, which they did in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1931]]. Yet as the war ended in victory the public demanded fresh leadership. The Conservatives were soundly defeated in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 General Election]] by a resurgent Labour Party.\n\n==Post war recovery==\n{{main|Postwar Britain}}\nThe party responded to its defeat of 1945 by accepting many of the Attlee government's welfare state reforms, while offering a distinctive Conservative edge, as set out in their policy statement ''[[Industrial Charter]]'' (1947). Until the 1970s the two parties largely agreed on foreign policy, with both supporting [[NATO]] (1949\u2013present) and the Anglo-American alliance of the [[Cold War]] (1947\u20131989). Economic recovery was slow, however, and that provided the opening for a comeback.\n\n===Popular dissatisfaction===\nIn the late 1940s, the Conservative Party incited growing public anger against [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], scarcity, controls, austerity, and omnipresent government bureaucracy. It used the dissatisfaction with the socialistic and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and to build a political comeback that won the 1951 general election. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced even more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.<ref>Ina Zweiniger-Bargileowska, \"Rationing, austerity and the Conservative party recovery after 1945,\" ''Historical Journal'' (1994) 37#1 pp. 173\u201397</ref>\n\n===Modernising the party===\nThe success of the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was validated by its victory in the 1951 election. It had restored its credibility on economic policy with the Industrial Charter written by [[Rab Butler]], which emphasised the importance of removing unnecessary controls, while going far beyond the laissez-faire attitude of old toward industrial social problems. Churchill was party leader, but he brought in a Party Chairman to modernise the creaking institution. [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946\u201355, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasised a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour.\" The libertarian influence of Professor [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s 1944 best-seller ''Road to Serfdom'' was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party from Peel to Major'' (1997) pp. 260\u201364</ref>\n\nWith a narrow win in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], Churchill was back. Although he was aging rapidly, he had national and global prestige. Apart from rationing, which was ended, most of the welfare state enacted by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the \"[[post war consensus]]\", which lasted until the 1970s.<ref>[[Richard Toye]], \"From 'Consensus' to 'Common Ground': The Rhetoric of the Postwar Settlement and its Collapse,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (2013) 48#1 pp. 3\u201323.</ref> The Conservatives were conciliatory toward unions, but they did de-nationalise the steel and road haulage industries in 1953.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

Eden had an immense personal popularity and lengthy experience as Foreign Secretary, and saw the Conservatives win the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|general election]] with an increased majority later that year, but his government then ran into a number of troubles on the domestic front as the economy began to overheat.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393283.stm 1955: Eden given mandate] BBC News.</ref>\n\nIn international affairs the spectacular fiasco of the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 ended Eden's career, but it had little negative impact on the party. The succession was contentious, with [[Rab Butler]] as the favourite to succeed. However, it was [[Harold Macmillan]] who became the next Prime Minister and leader of the party. Macmillan sought to rebuild the government's image both at home and abroad, and presided over strong economic growth and a massive expansion in the consumer-product economy. In 1959 he won the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|general election of that year]] on this economic success, summed up in the slogan \"You've never had it so good\". The Conservatives had now won three general elections in succession and once again they had increased their majority. Such was the scale of their success that there was widespread public and media doubt as to whether the Labour Party was capable of winning a general election ever again.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393287.stm 1959: Macmillan wins Tory hat trick] BBC News</ref>\n\nHowever, rising unemployment and an economic downturn in the early 1960s eroded support for Macmillan's government. It was further rocked in 1963 by the resignation of the Secretary of State for War [[John Profumo]] over the [[Profumo affair]]. In October of that year, Macmillan was misdiagnosed with terminal cancer and resigned.\n\nThe party at this time lacked a formal process for electing a new leader and Macmillan's resignation took place in the week of the annual Conservative Party Conference. This event rapidly became an American-style convention as leading ministers sought to establish their credentials. Eventually Macmillan formally recommended to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] that she appoint the [[Alec Douglas-Home|Earl of Home]] as Prime Minister. Home was appointed and renounced his peerage, becoming Sir Alec Douglas-Home, but was unable to restore the party's fortunes and narrowly lost the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] to [[Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson's]] Labour, who ended 13 years of Conservative rule.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393293.stm 1964: Labour scrapes through] BBC News</ref>\n\n==The Heath years: 1965\u20131975==\n[[File:Heathdod.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Conservative Prime Minister (1970\u20131974) [[Edward Heath]]]]\nFollowing the 1964 defeat, the party formally installed a system for electing the leader. Douglas-Home stepped down in 1965 and the [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election|election to succeed him]] was won by [[Edward Heath]] over both [[Reginald Maudling]] and [[Enoch Powell]]. The party proceeded to lose the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]]. Heath's leadership proved controversial, with frequent calls from many prominent party members and supporters for him to step down, but he persevered. To the shock of almost everyone bar Heath, the party won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]].\n\nAs with all British governments in this period, Heath's time in office was difficult. Furthermore, the Heath premiership remains one of the most controversial in the history of the party. Initial attempts to follow [[monetarist]] policies (later considered \"[[Thatcherite]]\") failed, with high inflation and unemployment blocking Heath's attempts at reforming the increasingly militant trade unions. The era of 1970s British industrial unrest had arrived.\n\n[[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland would lead Heath to suspending the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and introducing [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] as a precursor to establishing a [[power-sharing]] executive under the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. This resulted in the Conservative Party losing the support of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] at Westminster, which was to have consequences in later years when the party found itself reliant on tiny Commons majorities. Heath himself considered his greatest success in office to be the United Kingdom's entry into the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (or the \"Common Market\" as it was widely called at the time) but in subsequent years the UK's membership of the EEC was to prove the source of the greatest division in the party.\n\nThe country suffered a further bout of inflation in 1973 as a result of the [[OPEC]] cartel raising oil prices, and this in turn led to renewed demands for wage increases in the coal industry. The government refused to accede to the miner's demands, resulting in a series of stoppages and massive attempts to ration power, including the \"[[Three Day Week]]\". Heath decided to call a snap election on the question of \"Who Governs Britain?\". However the Conservative Party was unprepared, whilst the miners' unions stated that they did not see how the re-election of the government would change the situation. The Conservatives were further rocked by the death of [[Iain Macleod]] and the resignation of [[Enoch Powell]], who denounced the government for taking the country into the EEC and called on voters to back the Labour Party, who had promised a [[referendum]] on withdrawal. The [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]] produced an unusual result as support for the Liberals, [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] all surged, [[Northern Ireland]]'s politics became more localised, whilst the Conservatives won a plurality of votes but Labour had a plurality of seats. With a [[hung Parliament]] elected and the [[Ulster Unionists]] refusing to support the Conservative party, Heath tried to negotiate with the Liberals to form a coalition, but the attempts foundered on demands that were not acceptable to both parties. Heath was forced to resign as Prime Minister.\n\nThese years were seen as the height of \"consensus politics\". However, by the 1970s many traditional methods of running the economy, managing relations with trade unions, and so on began to fail\u2014or had outright already failed. This was also a period of Labour-Party ascendancy, as they ruled for nearly twelve out of the fifteen years between 1964 and 1979. Many in the Conservative Party were left wondering how to proceed.\n\n==The Thatcher Years, 1975\u20131990==\n[[File:Margaret Thatcher (1983).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Conservative Prime Minister (1979\u20131990) [[Margaret Thatcher]]]]\n\nHeath remained leader of the party despite growing challenges to his mandate, and the fact that he had now lost three of his four general elections as party leader. At the time there was no system for challenging an incumbent leader but after renewed pressure and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|a second general election defeat]] a system was put in place and Heath agreed to holding a [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to allow him to renew his mandate. In spite of his track record as Conservative party leader, which had included defeat at three out of four general elections, few both inside and out of the party expected him to be seriously challenged, let alone defeated. However, [[Margaret Thatcher]] stood against Heath and in a shock result outpolled him on the first ballot, leading him to withdraw from the contest. Thatcher then faced off four other candidates to become the first woman to lead a major British political party. Thatcher had much support from the [[Monetarism|monetarists]], led by [[Keith Joseph]]. The Conservatives would eventually capitalise on the [[Winter of Discontent]] during late 1978 and early 1979, and even in the very early Thatcher era they were able to criticise the Labour government for rising inflation and unemployment, not to mention the humiliating bailout of the UK economy by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] in 1976. However, when the Labour government lost its parliamentary majority in March 1977, it survived a vote of confidence in parliament when challenged by the Conservatives, and then formed an electoral pact with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in order to prevent another similar threat to its power.\n\n[[James Callaghan]] had succeeded [[Harold Wilson]] as Labour leader and prime minister in March 1976, and in September 1978 resisted calls to hold a general election, despite improving economic conditions and opinion polls which showed Labour well placed to win a parliamentary majority. However, this proved to be a disastrous miscalculation by Callaghan, which the Tories took advantage of, as the Winter of Discontent followed and the Tories were ascendant in the opinion polls. A vote of no confidence was delivered against Callaghan's government in March 1979, and the Tories won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] with a majority of 43 seats, with Thatcher becoming Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nThatcher soon introduced controversial and difficult economic reforms in order to solve the crises which had blighted Britain for most of the 1970s. The [[Falklands War]], the perceived [[hard left]] nature of the Labour Party, and the intervention of the centrist [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] all contributed to her party winning the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] in a landslide, gaining a majority of 144. This was despite dismal opinion poll showings for the Conservative government until the Falklands conflict, and also in spite of the [[early 1980s recession]] and mass unemployment. Thatcher's monetarist policies had a positive effect in the battle against inflation, which dropped from 27% in 1979 to less than 10% by 1982 and down to 4% by 1983.\n\nThatcher won a third successive election in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], this time with a 102-seat majority. Unemployment had now fallen below 3 million for the first time since 1981, and the economy was continuing to improve.\n\nThe second and third terms were dominated by privatisations of Britain's many state-owned industries, including [[British Telecom]] in 1984, the bus companies in 1985, [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] in 1986, [[British Airways]] in 1987, [[Austin Rover]] (formerly [[British Leyland]]), and [[British Steel Corporation]] in 1988. In 1984, Thatcher also successfully concluded five-year-long negotiations over Britain's budget to the [[European Community|European Economic Community]]. (''See [[UK rebate]]''.)\n\nIn 1989, the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (frequently referred to as the \"[[Tax per head|poll tax]]\") was introduced to replace the ancient system of rates (based on property values) which funded local government. This unpopular new charge was a flat rate per adult no matter what their circumstances; it seemed to be shifting the tax burden disproportionately onto the poor. Once again Thatcher's popularity sagged, but this time the Conservatives thought it might cost them the election. [[Michael Heseltine]], a former cabinet member, challenged her for the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership in November 1990]]. She won the first round, but not enough to win outright, and having initially announced her intention to \"fight on and fight to win\" she resigned after it was clear the cabinet wouldn't back her she announced her intention to stand down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2549000/2549189.stm|title=1990: Thatcher quits as prime minister|work=BBC on this day|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> This signalled the end of her time in office on 22 November 1990 after 11 years as prime minister\u2014a longer spell in power than any prime minister of the 20th century. In the ensuing second ballot, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Major]] beat Heseltine and [[Douglas Hurd]]. Thatcher continued to sit in parliament as an MP until the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], when she stepped down from parliament after 33 years.\n\n==The Major years: 1990\u20131997==\n[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Conservative Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) [[John Major]]]]\n\nMajor introduced a replacement for the Community Charge, the [[Council Tax]], and continued with the privatisations, and went on to narrowly win the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]] with a majority of 21.\n\nMajor's government was beset by scandals, crisis, and missteps. Many of the scandals were about the personal lives of politicians which the media construed as hypocrisy, but the [[Cash for Questions]] affair and the divisions over [[European Union|EU]] were substantive. In 1995, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party in order to trigger [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|a leadership election]] which he hoped would give him a renewed mandate, and quieten the Maastricht rebels (e.g. [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Bill Cash]], [[Bernard Jenkin]]). [[John Redwood]], then Secretary of State for Wales, stood against Major and gained around a fifth of the leadership vote. He was one of the people whom Major inadvertently referred to as 'bastards' during a television interview. Major was pleased that [[Michael Heseltine]] had not stood against him and gave him the position of [[Deputy Prime Minister]] as a result.\n\nAs the term went on, with by-elections being consistently lost by the Conservatives, their majority declined and eventually vanished entirely. Getting every vote out became increasingly important to both sides, and on several occasions ill MPs were wheeled into the [[British House of Commons|Commons]] to vote. Eventually, the Government became a technical minority.\n\nAs predicted, the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election of May 1997]] was a win for the Labour Party, but the magnitude of the victory surprised almost everyone. There was a swing of 20% in some places, and Labour achieved a majority of 179 with 43% of the vote to the Conservatives' 31%. [[Tactical voting]] against the Conservatives is believed to have caused around 40 seats to change hands. They lost all their seats outside England, with prominent members such as [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Malcolm Rifkind]] among the losses. Major resigned within 24 hours.\n\nIt is often said that the Conservatives lost the 1997 election due to EU party-policy divisions. However, it is likely that the European question played only a small or insignificant part in the result. Accusations of \"Tory sleaze\", apathy towards a government that had been in power for nearly two decades, and a rebranded \"New\" Labour Party with a dynamic and charismatic leader ([[Tony Blair]]) are all probable factors in the Conservative defeat.\n\n===Tory \"sleaze\"===\nA number of [[British political scandals|political scandal]]s in the 1990s (building on previous examples in the 1980s) created the impression of what is described in the British press as \"sleaze\": a perception, peaking towards the end of the Major era, that the Conservatives were associated with [[political corruption]] and [[hypocrisy]]. In particular the successful entrapment of [[Graham Riddick]] and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] in the \"cash for questions\" scandal, the contemporaneous misconduct as a minister by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] (who lost a consequent libel action against ''The Guardian''), and the convictions of former Cabinet member [[Jonathan Aitken]] and former party deputy chairman [[Jeffrey Archer]] for [[perjury]] in two separate cases leading to custodial sentences damaged the Conservatives' public reputation. Persistent unsubstantiated rumours about the activities of the party treasurer [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Michael Ashcroft]] did not help this impression.\n\nAt the same time a series of revelations about the private lives of various Conservative politicians also grabbed the headlines and both the media and the party's opponents made little attempt to clarify the distinction between financial conduct and private lives.\n\n[[John Major]]'s \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" morality campaign back-fired on him by providing an excuse for the British media to expose \"sleaze\" within the Conservative Party and, most damagingly, within the Cabinet itself. A number of ministers were then revealed to have committed sexual indiscretions, and Major was forced by media pressure to dismiss them. In September 2002 it was revealed that, prior to his promotion to the cabinet, Major had himself had a longstanding extramarital affair with a fellow MP, [[Edwina Currie]].\n\n==William Hague: 1997\u20132001==\nThe [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|ensuing leadership election]] was contested by five candidates. The electorate for the contest consisted solely of the 165 Conservative MPs who had been returned to the House of Commons. The candidates were [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[William Hague]], [[John Redwood]], [[Peter Lilley]] and [[Michael Howard]], with [[Stephen Dorrell]] launching an initial bid but withdrawing before polling began, citing limited support, and backing Clarke. Clarke was the favoured candidate of the [[Europhile]] left of the party, while the three latter candidates divided right-wing support roughly equally. Hague, who had initially supported Howard, emerged second as a compromise candidate and won the final ballot after Redwood and Clarke negotiated a joint ticket which was derided as an ''Instability Pact'' by their opponents (punning on the economic Stability Pact of the [[European Community]]).\n\nAt first William Hague portrayed himself as a moderniser with a common touch. However, by the time the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] came he concentrated on Europe, asylum seekers and tax cuts whilst declaring that only the Conservative Party could \"Save the Pound\". Though a master debater who would regularly trounce Tony Blair in the Commons,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} his leadership tenure was beset by poor publicity and stumbles. Despite a low turnout, the election resulted in a net gain of a single seat for the Conservative Party and William Hague's resignation as party leader.\n\n==Iain Duncan Smith: 2001\u20132003==\nThe [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|2001 leadership election]] was conducted under a new leadership electoral system designed by Hague. This resulted in five candidates competing for the job: [[Michael Portillo]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] and [[Michael Ancram]]. The drawn-out and at times acrimonious election saw Conservative MPs select Iain Duncan Smith and Ken Clarke to be put forward for a vote by party members. As Conservative Party members are characteristically Eurosceptic, Iain Duncan Smith was elected, even though opinion polls showed that the public preferred Ken Clarke, a member of the [[Tory Reform Group]]. (''Main article: [[2001 Conservative leadership election]].'')\n\nIain Duncan Smith (often known as IDS) was a strong [[euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] but this did not define his leadership \u2013 indeed it was during his tenure that Europe ceased to be an issue of division in the party as it united behind calls for a referendum on the proposed [[European Union Constitution]]. Duncan Smith's [[Shadow Cabinet]] contained many new and unfamiliar faces but despite predictions by some that the party would lurch to the right the team instead followed a pragmatic moderate approach to policy.\n\nOn 27 October Iain Duncan Smith began to face calls within his own party to either resign as leader or face a [[vote of confidence]]. Under the rules of the Conservative party, the backbench [[Conservative 1922 Committee]] would review the leadership, and in order for this to take place the chairman of the committee, Sir [[Michael Spicer, Baron Spicer|Michael Spicer]] must be presented with 25 letters proposing a vote.\n\nOn 28 October sufficient letters were presented to the chairman of the 1922 Committee to initiate a vote of confidence in Iain Duncan Smith. The vote came on 29 October, and IDS lost 90 to 75.\n\n==Michael Howard: 2003\u20132005==\nDuncan Smith remained as caretaker leader until [[Michael Howard]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Folkestone]] and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], was [[2003 Conservative Party leadership election|elected to the post of leader]] (as the only candidate) on 6 November 2003.\n\nHoward announced radical changes to the way the [[Shadow Cabinet]] would work. He slashed the number of members by half, with [[Theresa May]] and [[Tim Yeo]] each shadowing two government departments. Minor departments still have shadows but have been removed from the cabinet, and the post of Shadow Leader of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was abolished. The role of party chairman was also split into two, with [[Lord Saatchi]] responsible for the party machine, and [[Liam Fox]] handling publicity. [[Michael Portillo]] was offered a position but refused, due to his plans to step down from Parliament at the next election.\n\nAlso, a panel of \"grandees\", including [[John Major]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[William Hague]] and, notably, [[Kenneth Clarke]] has been set up to advise the leadership as they see fit.\n\nOn 2 January 2004, influenced by Saatchi, Howard defined a personal credo and [[list of the core beliefs of the Conservative Party of 2004|list of core beliefs of the party]]. At the party conference of October 2004, the Conservatives presented their \"[[Timetable For Action]]\" that a Conservative government would follow.\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:New-conservative-logo.png|thumb|right|The logo of the Conservative Party during the Howard years]] -->\nIn the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], the Conservative Party made a partial recovery by a net gain of 31 seats, with the Labour majority falling to 66.\n\nThe day after, on 6 May, Howard announced that he believed himself too old to lead the party into another election campaign, and he would therefore be stepping down to allow a new leader the time to prepare for the next election. Howard said that he believed that the party needed to amend the rules governing the election of the Party leader, and that he would allow time for that to happen before resigning. ''See [[2005 Conservative Party leadership election]]''\n\nThe 2005 campaign received criticism from its main financial backer, [[Michael Spencer]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1604717,00.html]{{Dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' [[Tim Collins (politician)|Tim Collins]] claimed that the specific reasons the party won more seats may not repeat themselves in the next general election::\n*The unpopularity of Tony Blair. This helped the Liberal Democrats and hence the Conservative Party in close fights. Blair will not be standing at the next election.\n*The left-of-Labour policies of the Liberal Democrats helped Conservatives in Conservative/Lib Dem marginal seats.\n*Labour's campaign in their marginal seats was poor.\n\n==David Cameron: 2005\u20132016==\n[[File:David_Cameron_official.jpg|thumb|upright|Conservative Prime Minister (2010\u20132016) [[David Cameron]]]]\n[[David Cameron]] won the subsequent leadership campaign on 6 December 2005. Cameron beat his closest rival [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] by a margin of more than two to one, taking 134,446 votes to 64,398, and announced his intention to reform and realign the Conservative Party in a manner similar to that achieved by the Labour Party in opposition under Tony Blair. As part of this he distanced from himself from the much hated Conservative Party of the past, for example apologising for [[Section 28]], and focused in on modern environmental issues.\n\nIn April 2006 the party set out to deliver a promise by Cameron to modernise its parliamentary representation. A central candidates' committee reduced some five hundred aspiring politicians on the party's list of approved parliamentary candidates to an \"[[A-List (Conservative)|A-list]]\" of between 100 and 150 priority candidates.<ref>Will Woodward and Tania Branigan, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/19/uk.conservatives The A-list: new leader's drive for women and minority candidates]'' in ''[[The Guardian]]'' dated 19 April 2006</ref> More than half of the names on the resulting list proved to be female, and several were of non-Establishment figures of various kinds.<ref>Will Woodward, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/may/11/uk.media Former soap star on Cameron's A-list of Tory candidates]'' in ''The Guardian'', 11 May 2006</ref>\n\nAfter the party had led in [[opinion poll]]s for most of Cameron's time in office, a [[hung parliament]] was achieved in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], with the Conservatives achieving the most votes and largest number of seats in parliament. This outcome had been widely predicted and was largely due to a surge in support for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Cameron successfully negotiated with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] on forming a [[coalition government]].\n\nIn office, David Cameron oversaw an economic recovery and a reduction in government spending,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Giles|first1=Chris|title=Figuring out Cameron's spending cuts|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e083a3fc-546b-11e4-84c6-00144feab7de|website=Financial Times|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> as well as the legalisation of same-sex marriage. He then led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 General election]] in which the Conservatives achieved their first majority since 1992.\n\nThe 2015 election manifesto included a pledge to have a referendum on Britain's membership of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]], after having promised the plebiscite in 2013. After undertaking a renegotiation of Britain's membership with the EU, the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] was called for 23 June 2016 and resulted in a vote to leave the EU by 52%. Cameron subsequently resigned as Prime Minister after having taken a key role in campaigning for a continuation of Britain's membership of the EU.\n<br />The campaign had led to serious tensions in the party <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/07/politics-live-governments-9million-anti-brexit-letter-sparks-fur/|title=Tories at war over EU 'propaganda' leaflet as MPs threaten to 'grind Government to a halt' in protest at David Cameron|author=Kate McCann and Michael Wilkinson|work=Daily Telegraph|date=8 April 2015|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref> and it emerged that Cameron had forbidden the Civil service from doing any serious planning for Brexit<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37360386|title=Brexit: Cameron 'blocked' civil service talks with Leave campaigners|work=BBC news|date=14 December 2016|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref> apparently because of a fear the plans would be leaked.

After Gove too was eliminated from the contest Leadsom, a junior minister with little experience, caused controversy by claiming she had more of a stake in the future of society than May because she had children when the latter was medically unable to have children. Leadsom subsequently withdrew from the contest, citing a lack of support within the party.\n\nIn her first speech after taking office, May vowed to tackle injustice and social mobility, seen by many as a departure from the Thatcherite consensus that had been continued by her predecessor. She vowed to legislate for the expansion of selective Grammar schools, peg the pay of top executives to those on the lowest wages in big companies whilst bringing an end to the austerity agenda which dominated the previous administration.\n\nAlthough she supported remain in the EU referendum, she appointed several leave supporters to the cabinet in a wide-ranging shake up including [[Boris Johnson]] as [[UK Foreign Secretary|Foreign Secretary]] and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] as [[Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union|Secretary of State for Leaving the EU]] in a bid to unify the party. On 29 March, Parliament voted to activate [[Article 50]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/article-50-trigger-latest-theresa-may-brexit-begins-leave-eu-talks-negotiations-a7655636.html |title=Article 50 triggered: Theresa May formally begins Brexit negotiations to leave EU |work=The Independent|date=29 March 2017 |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith a majority of 12, reduced to 11 following the defeat of [[Zac Goldsmith]] in the [[Richmond Park UK Constituency|Richmond Park]] by-election, many had speculated whether May would annul the [[Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011|Fixed Term Parliament Act]] to call an early General Election. However, she ruled that scenario out on a number of occasions, vowing to hold the election in May 2020 as scheduled.\n\nTheresa May changed her mind in April 2017 and called for an early election. This occurred on [[2017 United Kingdom general election|8 June 2017]], in which the Conservatives lost their majority. \n\nThis resulted in a hung parliament and May agreed a confidence and supply deal with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] to create a tenuous majority. However, since then she has faced calls to resign,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40403434 |title=Conservatives agree pact with DUP to support May government |publisher=BBC News |date=26 June 2017 |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> agreeing to do so finally in the summer of 2019.
