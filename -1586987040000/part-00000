They came to prominence with the release of their third studio album, ''[[Boys and Girls in America]]'', in 2006. In 2010, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist [[Franz Nicolay]] left the band prior to the recording of their fifth studio album, ''[[Heaven Is Whenever]]'' (2010). During the band's subsequent tour, the band became a five piece, once more, with the addition of guitarist [[Steve Selvidge]].<ref name=\"blogs.riverfronttimes.com\"/> The band released their sixth LP, ''[[Teeth Dreams]]'', on March 25, 2014. \n\nNicolay re-joined the band on May 4, 2016, and the band has since embarked on several concert residencies in the US and the UK. To coincide with each new event, The Hold Steady releases stand-alone singles, marking the first recorded material of the six-piece line-up. The band's seventh LP, ''[[Thrashing Thru the Passion]]'', was released in August 2019.\n\n==History==\nIn 2003, Minnesota-raised singer, writer, and guitarist [[Craig Finn]] and New York City bartender and bassist Galen Polivka began talking about starting a band. Finn and lead guitarist Tad Kubler (both formerly of [[Lifter Puller]]) developed the idea of The Hold Steady when, while watching [[The Band]] concert film ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', Finn asked Kubler, \"Dude, why aren't there any bands like this anymore?\"<ref>{{cite web | url= http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2007/01/29/ArtsLiving/Hold-Steady.Returns.Hope.To.Rocknroll-2675473.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailycollegian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | last= Master | first= Dave | title= Hold Steady returns hope to rock'n'roll : Daily Collegian exclusive interview with Craig Finn | publisher= The Daily Collegian | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185836/http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2007/01/29/ArtsLiving/Hold-Steady.Returns.Hope.To.Rocknroll-2675473.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailycollegian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | archivedate= 2007-09-30 }}</ref> The Hold Steady's 2004 debut album ''[[Almost Killed Me]]'', released on [[Frenchkiss Records]], was a [[sleeper hit]] among music [[critic]]s, reaching No.&nbsp;31 in the ''[[Pazz & Jop]]'' critics poll that year, an achievement which Finn described as \"like being nominated for an Oscar or something.\"<ref name=villagevoice/> In May 2005, they were the first rock band to grace the front page of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in 15 years {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. They were ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'''s 2006 \"Band of the Year\".\n\nThe band released its second album, ''[[Separation Sunday]]'', on May 3, 2005. The album was a loose [[concept album]] following the exploits of a character named \"Holly\" (short for \"Hallelujah\") and her quest to find a balance between [[Catholicism]] and [[rock and roll]] through drugs and a metaphorical resurrection. The album was critically lauded, and its religious overtones were picked up by many critics, such as Joe Gross of the ''[[Village Voice]]'', who dubbed it \"the most egregiously American [[Catholic]] album since [[X (U.S. band)|X]]'s ''[[Under the Big Black Sun]]'', [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]]'s ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'', or that Jewish new waver [[Billy Joel]]'s ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]''.\"<ref name=villagevoice>{{cite web | url= https://www.villagevoice.com/2005/04/26/the-gospel-according-to-the-hold-steady/ | last= Gross | first= Joe | title= The Gospel According to the Hold Steady | publisher= Village Voice}}</ref>\n\n===''Boys and Girls in America'' (2006\u20132007)===\nAfter ''[[Separation Sunday]]'', the band moved from the [[Frenchkiss Records]] imprint to [[Vagrant Records]].

The album was a loose [[concept album]] following the exploits of a character named \"Holly\" (short for \"Hallelujah\") and her quest to find a balance between [[Catholicism]] and [[rock and roll]] through drugs and a metaphorical resurrection. The album was critically lauded, and its religious overtones were picked up by many critics, such as Joe Gross of the ''[[Village Voice]]'', who dubbed it \"the most egregiously American [[Catholic]] album since [[X (U.S. band)|X]]'s ''[[Under the Big Black Sun]]'', [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]]'s ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'', or that Jewish new waver [[Billy Joel]]'s ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]''.\"<ref name=villagevoice>{{cite web | url= https://www.villagevoice.com/2005/04/26/the-gospel-according-to-the-hold-steady/ | last= Gross | first= Joe | title= The Gospel According to the Hold Steady | publisher= Village Voice}}</ref>\n\n===''Boys and Girls in America'' (2006\u20132007)===\nAfter ''[[Separation Sunday]]'', the band moved from the [[Frenchkiss Records]] imprint to [[Vagrant Records]].
