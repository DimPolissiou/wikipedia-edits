The inscriptions found in these districts record grants of villages located in the Kosala country, and the rulers mentioned in these inscriptions are given the titles indicating their lordship over Dakshina Kosala (such as ''Kosaladhisha'', ''Kosaladhipati'', and ''Kosala-narendra'').{{sfn|Hira Lal|1986|p=162}}\n\nAccording to the 7th century Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]], the extent of the contemporary Kosala kingdom was 6,000 [[li (unit)|li]] in circuit, that is, around 81,000 square miles in area.{{sfn|Hira Lal|1986|pp=161-162}} This suggests that in the 7th century, the Dakshina Kosala region encompassed an area much larger than the region bounded by the above-mentioned districts. The [[Somavamshi dynasty|Somavamshi]] inscriptions suggest that other areas of present-day Odisha, bordering Sambalpur, were also part of the Dakshina Kosala. During Xuanzang's period, Kosala appears to have extended from [[78th meridian east]] to the [[85th meridian east]] in the east-west direction.{{sfn|Hira Lal|1986|p=162}}\n\nThe northern boundary of Kosala was located a little to the south of [[Amarakantaka]], which was a part of the [[Panduvamshis of Mekala|Mekala]] kingdom.{{sfn|Hira Lal|1986|p=162}} The [[Puranas]], including the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' and the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', mention Mekala and Kosala as distinct regions.

North Kosala went to Lava as his share with Shravasti Nagari as his capital  while Kusha received South Kosala.

The government was formed following the [[suicide of Adolf Hitler]] on 30 April 1945 during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. It was headed by Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] as the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident]] and [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] as the Leading Minister.\n\nThe administration was referred to as the \"Flensburg Government\" because D\u00f6nitz's headquarters had been relocated to the port of [[Flensburg]] in northern Germany on 3 May 1945.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=88}} Due to the rapid [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] advance, its nominal jurisdiction at the outset was limited to a narrow wedge of territory running from the [[Austria]]n border through Berlin to the Danish border; which, since 25 April 1945, had been cut in two by the American advance to join with Soviet forces at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe]].  Following the capitulation of all German armed forces on 8 May, the Flensburg government lost all direct territorial, military or civil jurisdiction, and all diplomatic relations were withdrawn. The western Allies allowed the Flensburg government to continue to meet and conduct what business it could until 23 May when they arrested its members as [[prisoners of war]], effectively dissolving the government although the dissolution was not formally recognized by the Allied Powers until 5 June.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=323}}\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-127-06A, Karl D\u00f6nitz - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\n\nOnce it became apparent that Hitler intended to stay and die in the besieged city of Berlin, effective overall command of German armed forces was exercised through the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (German High Command), which had relocated to [[Rheinsburg]].  Anticipating that German-held territory would be split, separate military and civilian commands had provisionally been established on 15 April; under Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] at [[Pullach]] for forces in the south and west, and under Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] at [[Pl\u00f6n]] for forces in the north and east; but then Hitler had stalled on transferring executive military authority to them.\n\nOn 27 April [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and [[Alfred Jodl]], of the Army High Command, met at Rheinsburg with [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]] to discuss the war situation now that the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]] could not be averted. Himmler took the chair as the acknowledged deputy [[F\u00fchrer]]; and, since the disgrace and dismissal of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], Hitler's expected successor. As they were leaving Rheinsberg on 28 April, Himmler asked D\u00f6nitz to confirm that he would be willing to serve in a successor government that Himmler might form. That day however, the British and Americans published Himmler's secret proposals for a separate peace in the West (which they had rejected). On 29 April D\u00f6nitz received a telegram from [[Martin Bormann]] announcing Himmler's dismissal from all posts, and ordering his arrest for treason.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=88}} D\u00f6nitz went to Himmler's headquarters in L\u00fcbeck on 30 April to confront him with the accusations, but Himmler denied them as fabricated propaganda. When a further telegram from Bormann that day confirmed both the dismissal and D\u00f6nitz's appointment as Hitler's successor, Himmler's position became untenable, and D\u00f6nitz summoned him to Pl\u00f6n that night to tell him so.\n\n[[File:1945-05-01GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Situation of World War II in Europe at the time of Hitler\u2019s death.

The same day D\u00f6nitz accepted the offices of Supreme Commander and Head of State in separate broadcast addresses to the German armed forces, and German people.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=89}} Residual ministers of the [[Hitler Cabinet|Hitler cabinet]], who had fled from the fall of Berlin to join D\u00f6nitz at the [[Wehrmacht]] barracks near [[Pl\u00f6n]] in [[Holstein]], resigned the next day.  Suspecting that Bormann might also have escaped from Berlin and be intending to seize power, D\u00f6nitz met with Hitler's former Finance Minister [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] and asked him to constitute a new [[Cabinet of Germany|Reich government]].{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=96}}\n\nVon Krosigk's cabinet first met in [[Eutin]], to which he and his ministerial staff had been evacuated, on 2 May. Later on 2 May, and in view of the rapidly advancing British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] forces which were approaching [[L\u00fcbeck]], D\u00f6nitz met with von Krosigk, [[Paul Wegener (Gauleiter)|Paul Wegener]], Himmler and Keitel to discuss the urgent necessity of a further relocation. Himmler argued for a move to [[Prague]], then the last major central European capital city in German hands, and closer to advancing American forces with whom he hoped to negotiate personally, but D\u00f6nitz refused to sanction any move outside the borders of Germany. Moreover, the political situation of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was highly unstable. D\u00f6nitz decided instead to proceed to the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik|M\u00fcrwik naval academy]] in [[Flensburg]] near the Danish border. The cabinet met in the Sportschool of the naval academy; while administrative offices and accommodation for the various ministries were established on the liner {{Interlanguage link multi|MV Patria (1938)|de|3=Patria (Schiff, 1938)|lt=''Patria''}}, moored in Flensburg harbour.  The German High Command, which had moved from Rheinsburg to [[Neustadt in Holstein]] two days before, then also relocated to Flensburg, while the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leadership had been gathering at Flensburg since 28 April.\n\n==Cabinet==\nRetaining some members from the previous Hitler cabinet and [[Goebbels cabinet]], Karl D\u00f6nitz's government consisted of the following people:\n{{Cabinet table start|hiderefcol=y}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reichspr\u00e4sident]]\n | minister1              = [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 30 April 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = \"Leading Minister\"\n | minister1              = [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]\n | minister1              = Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community|Minister of the Interior]]\n | minister1              = [[Wilhelm Stuckart]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 6 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|Minister of Justice]]\n | minister1              = [[Otto Georg Thierack]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 24 August 1942\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = Minister of Finance\n | minister1              = Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk\n | minister1_termstart    = 1 June 1932\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = Minister of Industry and Production\n | minister1              = [[Albert Speer]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture|Minister for Food and Agriculture]]\n | minister1              = [[Herbert Backe]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1942\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[List of German labour ministers|Minister for Labour]]\n | minister1              = [[Franz Seldte]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = Minister of War\n | minister1              = [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]<ref>[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/DoenitzKarl/ Biography on dhm.de {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n | minister1_termstart    = 30 April 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Reich Ministry of Transport|Minister of Transport]]\n | minister1              = [[Julius Dorpm\u00fcller|Julius Heinrich Dorpm\u00fcller]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 February 1937\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[List of German postal ministers|Minister for Postal Affairs]]\n | minister1              = Julius Heinrich Dorpm\u00fcller\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production|Minister for Armaments and War Production]]\n | minister1              = [[Karl Saur]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 30 April 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table end}}\n\nD\u00f6nitz avoided including prominent Nazi leaders in his cabinet other than Speer, but included several serving officers in the SS and others who had been closely involved in formulating and prosecuting the genocidal policies of the former regime.  Herbert Backe had been the author of the [[Hunger Plan]] of 1941, a deliberate strategy for mass elimination by starvation of Soviet prisoners of war and 'surplus' Soviet urban populations. Speer's deputy in the Economics Ministry was [[Otto Ohlendorf]], who had personally directed the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Communists in occupied Soviet territory. Wilhelm Stuckart had been a participant at the [[Wannsee Conference]] of January 1942, when the administrative responsibilities for the \"[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Problem\" had been agreed.  Otto Ohlendorf had transferred across directly from directing Himmler's office as [[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]; and overall, of 350 staff working in the offices of the Flensburg government, 230 had been members of the SS or other security services.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}} D\u00f6nitz's cabinet picks were clearly circumscribed by who was available. Otherwise, and in spite of his subsequent claim that his government was 'unpolitical', the most consistent characteristic of those chosen was a virulent opposition to Bolshevism, and a determination to ensure that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolutionary events]] in Germany attending the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of 1918]] would not be repeated in 1945. As D\u00f6nitz did not then intend any surrender to the Soviets or Poles and continued to identify \"Jews and profiteers\u201d as enemies of the German people, he had little compunction over including in his cabinet men with blood on their hands, so long as that blood was Russian, Eastern European or Jewish.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}}\n\nFor the first few days the post of Minister of the Interior was kept vacant.  This had been the office of [[Heinrich Himmler]], but Himmler had been condemned as a traitor, dismissed from all functions and ordered to be arrested in [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Last Testament]]. D\u00f6nitz did not want Himmler's name associated with his new government, but nor could he afford to alienate the SS who remained armed and powerful. He tacitly set Hitler's instructions aside and continued to see Himmler on a daily basis without according him any formal appointment. It was only on 6 May 1945, while final negotiations were in prospect for a capitulation to U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the west, that D\u00f6nitz dismissed Himmler from all his posts, and appointed Stuckart in his place.\n\n=== Armed forces High Command ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H30220, Wilhelm Keitel.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilhelm Keitel]]\nD\u00f6nitz had hoped to be able to appoint Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]] as Commander in Chief of the Army and Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]), to which the Army High Command ([[Oberkommando des Heeres]]) had been subject since 28 April 1945, but he could not be contacted on 2 May, and so Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] was kept in the post; and in this capacity Keitel signed the act of surrender for the German High Command in Berlin on 8 May. A further factor favouring the continuation of Keitel as Commander in Chief was the support for him of [[Colonel General]] [[Alfred Jodl]], the Chief of Operations Staff of the ''Wehrmacht'', whose retention D\u00f6nitz recognised as essential. Jodl was to represent D\u00f6nitz in negotiations with the Allies in [[Reims]], France. Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]] was appointed to succeed D\u00f6nitz as Commander of the [[Kriegsmarine]], and was promoted by D\u00f6nitz to the rank of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' on 1 May. The Air Force had largely been destroyed or grounded due to lack of fuel, so no new appointment was made, Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] remaining Commander of the [[Luftwaffe]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=360}}\n\nIn spite of its repeated relocations, the Armed Forces High Command continued to function, its organisation and structures having been maintained. But the same was not true of any other arm of government. Starting in March 1945, the staff of the various ministries had been evacuated to resort hotels in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps \u2013 chiefly in the region of [[Berchtesgaden]], leaving only the ministers themselves in Berlin. On 13 April, the remaining foreign embassies and the diplomatic corps were evacuated to [[Bad Gastein]]. Finally on 20 April all the ministers and their personal staffs had been ordered to make their way southwards; but as by then the roads had been cut and there were insufficient transport aircraft available, several ministers (like von Krosigk) had perforce headed north instead. Thus the government of Germany was, at the death of Hitler, split over six centres. The [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]], the personal fiefdom of [[Joseph Goebbels]], had remained with him in Berlin, as had the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]] under [[Martin Bormann]]; while the [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe High Command]] had relocated to Berchtesgaden, having been until his abrupt dismissal on 23 April the counterpart fiefdom of G\u00f6ring. Himmler had retained his personal powerbase in the offices of the SS and security apparatus, which had been established in L\u00fcbeck in the north and then relocated to Flensburg. Other government ministries and ministers were then variously located at Berchtesgaden and D\u00f6nitz's headquarters in Pl\u00f6n. With the Armed Forces High Command also located in the north \u2013 although many OKW personnel had gone south \u2013 there was, in consequence, no semblance any longer of a German central government, and most of the members of von Krosigk's cabinet lacked any support staff from their nominal ministries.\n\n==Actions==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99621, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|upright|Heinrich Himmler]]\nD\u00f6nitz's initial priority was to open communication with the commanders of German armies, and to establish with them their acknowledgement of his new authority as sole Supreme Commander of all German armed forces. He also sought their agreement with his overall policy of negotiating successive partial surrenders with the Western Allies, while maintaining the war against Soviet forces in the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=362}} Key to this was sidelining [[Heinrich Himmler]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}} [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=361}} [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and other former Nazi grandees who had fled to Flensburg, but whose continued participation in government would preclude any negotiation with the western Allies. D\u00f6nitz's intentions in this were, if possible, to split the Allies, and to offer German military units as components of a common anti-Bolshevik front. Failing that, he sought to save as many German soldiers as possible from Soviet captivity by ordering units in the east to retreat westwards and surrender to the British, Canadians or Americans, and by redoubling [[Operation Hannibal]], the maritime evacuation of units trapped on the Baltic coast. At D\u00f6nitz's urging, Field Marshal Keitel and General Jodl attempted to direct what was left of the Wehrmacht towards these goals.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{citation | publisher = iBiblio | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450506a.html#1 | title = The German Surrender Documents \u2013 WWII}}</ref> On 2 May, D\u00f6nitz obtained pledges of allegiance from the commanders of German armies in Norway, Courland, East Prussia and Bohemia; these pledges were made to him personally as Supreme Commander, and not as Head of State in a forthcoming government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=352}}\n\nOtherwise, however, D\u00f6nitz's policies chiefly demonstrated continuity with the previous regime. The Nazi party was neither banned nor dissolved. D\u00f6nitz kept a bust of Hitler in his office; and the uniforms, insignia and protocol of Nazi Germany were maintained, initially including even the '[[Nazi salute|Heil Hitler]]' greeting. Following a plea from Speer, D\u00f6nitz on 2 May rescinded the infamous '[[Nero Decree]]' ordering [[scorched earth]] destruction of German infrastructure and industrial plants; but it was not until 6 May that counterpart destruction orders were rescinded for those territories remaining under German occupation, such as Norway. Moreover, neither summary courts for civil punishment, nor military discipline by summary courts martial were abolished, with military executions for insulting the memory of Hitler being confirmed even after the final capitulation on 8 May.\n\nWhile the presence of SS leaders and their staffs in Flensburg had provided D\u00f6nitz with a source of personnel to support his government, otherwise they presented problems. In particular, the SS leadership had access to armed forces that were not under D\u00f6nitz's control, and remained firmly loyal to Himmler, whom D\u00f6nitz had surmised was personally unacceptable now to both the Western Allies and to the Wehrmacht. D\u00f6nitz handled the issue by stringing Himmler along for as long as he could with vague prospects of a possible function in the government. Once serious negotiations were underway for surrender to Eisenhower, Himmler and the SS apparatus had to be got out of the way. On 5 May 1945 D\u00f6nitz informed Himmler of his forthcoming dismissal, promising false papers and identities for him and his leading lieutenants if they removed themselves promptly. Himmler called his fellow SS leaders together for a last time that day, and advised them to 'dive down within the Wehrmacht'. By the next day they had fled.\n\nThis came too late for the concentration camp prisoners within the area who were now within D\u00f6nitz's nominal authority, while under the actual control of the SS. These had numbered around 10,000 when D\u00f6nitz assumed the presidency; mainly former inmates of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg, which had been shut down in preparation for the surrender of the city to the British. Between 16 and 28 April, the prisoners had been moved eastwards and concealed by the SS in a flotilla of unseaworthy ships anchored in the [[Bay of L\u00fcbeck]], where they then remained without food or medical attention. At the time, this action had been opposed by Rear Admiral Konrad Englehardt on D\u00f6nitz's staff, but when the Flensburg government came into being, D\u00f6nitz made no attempt to free the prisoners, and his government avoided any subsequent acknowledgement that they had known they were there. On 3 May 1945, the prison flotilla was sunk by the Royal Air Force in the mistaken belief that the ships were being prepared to evacuate leading SS personnel. Over 7,000 prisoners drowned, mainly on the former liner ''[[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]]''.\n\n=== Partial capitulations in the West ===\n\nOn 2 May, while still at Pl\u00f6n, D\u00f6nitz was surprised to learn that German forces in Italy had surrendered unconditionally to the Western Allies. The capitulation had been negotiated without Hitler's knowledge or consent, and signed at [[Surrender of Caserta|Caserta]] on 29 April, but it did not come into effect for three days. While Hitler had been still alive, D\u00f6nitz had followed absolutely his commands to fight on to the last on all fronts. However, he now realized that the Wehrmacht's position in the West was untenable. He believed that surrendering German forces only to the Western Allies could present opportunities to split the British and Americans from the Soviets. Thereon he assumed direction of further German surrender initiatives, exploring opportunities for partial surrender in the West. In the East, however, he continued to order German armies to fight on. On 2 May, he tried unsuccessfully to countermand the decisions of the German commander in [[Berlin]] to surrender their forces to the Soviets; and on 3 May, issued orders to the besieged defenders of Courland and Breslau to maintain their resistance.\n\n[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|thumb|upright|Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery]]\nOn 3 May D\u00f6nitz sent Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]], his successor as naval commander in chief, to the headquarters of British Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] at [[L\u00fcneburg]], with an offer to surrender the German forces in northwest Germany, together with the remaining elements of [[Army Group Vistula]]. Montgomery informed Admiral von Friedeburg that he could not accept the surrender of forces fighting on the Eastern Front, and that consequently Army Group Vistula would have to surrender to the Soviets, although British forces would accept the surrender of any German soldiers fleeing westwards. He proposed instead, following discussions between Eisenhower and the British government, that he would accept the surrender of all German military forces in Northwestern Germany, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], the Netherlands and Denmark, including naval forces and warships in those areas. Von Friedeburg asked for 48 hours to consider this; Montgomery allowed him 24. The proposed inclusion of Denmark, and the German warships operating there, initially alarmed D\u00f6nitz, who wished at all costs to maintain [[Operation Hannibal]], evacuating German troops across the Baltic to Danish ports; but on consideration, he reckoned he might secretly evade the obligation to surrender these ships if they were at sea on the date the surrender came into effect. Furthermore, as it was unlikely that Montgomery would promptly be able to deploy British forces to the Danish islands under German occupation, especially [[Bornholm]] in the central Baltic, there was every possibility that the evacuation proceeding there could continue in total disregard of the agreed surrender terms. Consequently, authorized by D\u00f6nitz, von Friedeburg returned on 4 May and signed an instrument of surrender for all German troops and ships in the Netherlands, Denmark and Northwestern Germany. This was accepted by Montgomery on behalf of Eisenhower.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=367}} This 4 May surrender would become effective at 8:00&nbsp;am on 5 May; so D\u00f6nitz ordered all ships involved in Operation Hannibal to undertake a covert final evacuation voyage, while also unilaterally ordering all U-boat actions to cease. One crew in the evacuation fleet refused to set sail; so D\u00f6nitz ordered the ringleaders to be arrested for mutiny, tried by summary court martial, and shot.\n\nAlso, on 5 May 1945, all German forces in Bavaria and South West Germany signed an act of surrender to the Americans at [[Army Group G|Haar]], outside Munich, coming into effect on 6 May. Montgomery, always seeking to boost his own public standing at the expense of other Allied commanders, had arranged extensive media coverage of the 4 May signing, but D\u00f6nitz and von Krosigk realised that, although he had supplied von Friedeburg with a prepared German text of the surrender documents, Montgomery had failed to issue this to the press. They consequently broadcast their own, doctored, German version, which differed significantly from that signed, specifically in that warships in the Baltic were not included nor was the territory in Schleswig around Flensburg itself; and especially, the surrender was described as a 'truce', not a capitulation. As was D\u00f6nitz's intention, this broadcast exacerbated Stalin's suspicions of the partial capitulations, especially as the greater parts of the [[3rd Panzer Army]] and [[21st Army (Wehrmacht)|21st Army]] had indeed been able to surrender to the British and Americans, rather than the Soviets. Realising this, Eisenhower determined that no further partial capitulations would be negotiated.\n\nThe capitulations at Luneberg and Haar could do nothing, however, for the bulk of the German forces in [[Army Group Centre]], fighting the Soviets in [[Bohemia]] and [[Saxony]]. On 4 May D\u00f6nitz, together with [[Karl Hermann Frank|Karl Frank]] the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, conceived of a device whereby Army Group Centre might be able to surrender to General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s American forces, who had been entering the [[Sudetenland]] areas of former [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] from the west, and approaching [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]]. D\u00f6nitz proposed that Frank should dissolve the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and resign in favour of a puppet Czech government; who would then declare [[Prague]] an [[open city]] and invite the Americans in. General Patton's virulent anti-communist views were well known to the German leadership, who reckoned that with Patton in Prague it would become much easier for Army Group Centre to negotiate surrender terms with him while maintaining their resistance to the Soviets, if possible dragging American and Soviet armies into direct confrontation. Frank had hopes that \"we can engineer a disagreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union even more serious than that of Poland\". The ploy was proposed as being put into effect on 5 May, but was overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Prague uprising]] on that date; and over the succeeding three days, far from surrendering Prague as an open city, SS forces launched a savage response to the insurgents, with brutal reprisals against Czech civilians and widespread destruction in central Prague. Orders to fire-bomb the whole of the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] were only averted due to lack of fuel for Luftwaffe bombing units. Alerted to the German machinations through intercepted [[Ultra]] signals, Eisenhower ordered Patton to stand still in Pilsen in spite of ever more desperate calls for help from the insurgents. Prague was finally relieved by General [[Ivan Konev|Konev]]'s forces on 9 May 1945.\n\n=== General capitulation on all fronts ===\n[[File:Meeting of the Supreme Command.jpg|thumb|SHAEF commanders at a conference in London]]\nFollowing the success of the two partial surrenders of 4 and 5 May, D\u00f6nitz instructed von Friedeburg to go to the [[Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) to negotiate with General Eisenhower terms for a general surrender of all remaining German armies to the Western Allies.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=369}} Since von Friedeburg's meeting with Montgomery, Eisenhower's opposition to accepting a German surrender that excluded the Soviet Union had been made clear to the German High Command, but D\u00f6nitz hoped to change his mind.\n\nOn the next day, 5 May, von Friedeburg arrived at General Eisenhower's headquarters at [[Reims]], France, but learned that Eisenhower was resolute that only a total surrender on all fronts to all the Allies could be discussed. Jodl arrived a day later, ostensibly to sign such a general surrender. D\u00f6nitz had instructed him to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could move west to surrender to the Western Powers. Eisenhower made it clear that the Allies demanded immediate unconditional surrender on all fronts. When it became obvious that the Germans were stalling, Eisenhower threatened to close the western front to all surrendering Germans from the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=371}} Had this happened, German soldiers attempting to cross the line to surrender would be fired on and all subsequent surrenders would have to be to the Soviets. When D\u00f6nitz learned this, he radioed Jodl [[full powers]] to sign the unconditional [[German Instrument of Surrender]] at 1.30&nbsp;am on the morning of 7 May. Just over an hour later, Jodl signed the documents. The surrender documents included the phrase, \"The German High Command will at once issue orders to all German military, naval and air authorities and to all forces under German control to cease active operations at 2301 hours Central European time on 8 May and to remain in the positions occupied at that time.\" The Western Allies had a unified command structure, and formed a single expeditionary force, the \"Allied Expeditionary Force\". U.S. Army General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] (Eisenhower's chief of staff at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Western Allies, and General [[Ivan Susloparov]] (the Soviet liaison officer at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Soviets. French Major General [[Fran\u00e7ois Sevez]] signed as the official witness.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nAlthough Eisenhower had sought to keep General [[Aleksei Antonov]] of the Soviet High Command fully informed of the progress of the surrender negotiations, no confirmation had been received from the Soviets that the text of the Act of Military Surrender was acceptable to them, or that Susloparov was empowered to sign it. Accordingly, Eisenhower extracted from Jodl an additional signed undertaking that the Chief of the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]], and the Commanders in Chief of all three German armed services would attend in person and sign a \"formal ratification\" of the Act of Military Surrender, at a place and date to be specified.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Some six hours after the signing, a response came from Antonov that terms of surrender were unacceptable, and that Susloparov could not sign it. Eisenhower promptly agreed, and undertook to attend together with the rest of the SHAEF for the definitive signing in Berlin two days later. Antonov's response also noted that von Friedeburg had been referring matters back to D\u00f6nitz over the radio; and that D\u00f6nitz, in direct breach of the signed surrender terms, had still not issued orders for German forces in the east to remain in their positions but was instead instructing them to continue their resistance and flee westwards. Antonov stated that, while the internal discussions of the German military in no way obligated the Allied Powers, Jodl's signature could not be accepted as valid if he was doing so as D\u00f6nitz's representative since D\u00f6nitz himself was clearly acting in bad faith. He proposed that the definitive act of surrender should make it clear that the Commanders in Chief of each of the German armed services were, in signing it, surrendering their forces on the authority of the German High Command - and not as delegated by D\u00f6nitz or the purported Flensburg government.\n\nA second, amended, instrument of surrender was accordingly signed at Karlshorst, Berlin on 8 May shortly before midnight.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=372}} Marshal Zhukov signed for the Soviet High Command, and the British Marshal of the [[Royal Air Force]] [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|A.W. Tedder]] signed on behalf of the Western Allies (Tedder acted as Eisenhower's representative at the Berlin ceremony, and signed \"on behalf of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force\", in his capacity as Deputy Supreme Commander). French General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] and [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]] signed as the official witnesses.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The Allies had demanded that representatives of the German Army, Navy and Air Force, and the High Command of the Armed Forces, sign the ratification of unconditional surrender, and that they should present full powers authorizing them to do so on behalf of the German High Command.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Complying with that demand D\u00f6nitz issued a telegraphed communication from his \"Supreme Commander Headquarters\" (''Der Oberste Befehlshaber Hauptquartier'') granting the necessary full powers,<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>The text of the full powers, in German, was as follows: A b s c h r i f t.

DONITZ GRO\u00dfADMIRAL. Siegel.</ref> and accordingly the second Act of Military Surrender was signed by Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] as Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces and as acting Commander in Chief of the Army; by Admiral von Friedeburg as the Commander in Chief of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy), by General [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Stumpff]] as Deputy Commander in Chief of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) as Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]], the Air Force Commander, had been injured. At the time specified, [[end of World War II in Europe|World War II in Europe ended]]. On 9 May, D\u00f6nitz issued orders to the German Armed Forces regarding the military surrender.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=376}}\n\nThe text of the definitive surrender document signed in Berlin differed from that previously signed at Reims, chiefly in that, to the second article, was added the words \"..and to disarm completely, handing over their weapons and equipment to the local allied commanders or officers designated by the Representatives of the Allied Supreme Command\"; which had the effect of requiring German troop facing Soviet forces to hand over their weapons, disband and give themselves up as prisoners. Otherwise neither the Reims nor Berlin surrender instruments provided explicitly for the surrender of the German State, because the draft surrender document prepared by the [[European Advisory Commission]] (EAC) was not used. Instead, a simplified, military-only version had been produced by the SHAEF, based largely on the wording of the partial surrender instrument of German forces in Italy that had been signed at Caserta. This definition of the surrender as an act of military capitulation side-stepped any Allied recognition of the German Government, or of D\u00f6nitz as Head of State. The question of the civil effects of the unconditional surrender was only settled later, when the Allies decided to dissolve the Flensburg Government (23 May) and issued the Berlin declaration, proclaiming the direct assumption of the supreme governmental authority in Germany by the Allied Powers (5 June). The text of the Berlin Declaration was widely based on the EAC's draft instrument of surrender of Germany. The said draft was reworked into a unilateral declaration with an extended explanatory preamble, that spelled out the Allied position that as a result of its complete defeat Germany had been left without a government, a vacuum that the direct assumption of supreme authority by the Allies would replace.\n\n==Dissolution==\n\n=== Withdrawal of diplomatic recognition ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Schellenberg]]\nDuring 1944 and 1945 countries that had been neutral or allies of Germany had been joining the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] and declaring war on Germany.  The German embassies to these countries had been closed down, and their property and archives held in trust by a nominated [[protecting power]] (usually [[Switzerland]] or [[Sweden]]) under the terms of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. There were counterpart arrangements for the former embassies of Allied countries in Berlin. The [[United States Department of State]] had prepared for the diplomatic consequences of the war ending on the assumption that there would have been an explicit statement of unconditional surrender of the German state in accordance with the terms of a draft surrender text jointly agreed by the Allied powers in 1944. In the final days of April 1945 the State Department had notified the protecting powers, and all other remaining neutral governments (such as [[Ireland]]), that following the forthcoming German surrender the continued identity of the German state would rest solely in the four Allied Powers. The Allied Powers would immediately recall all German diplomatic staff, take ownership of all German state property, extinguish all protecting power functions, and require the transfer of all archives and records to one or another of the embassies of the western Allies.<ref name=\"Eckert 2012\">{{cite book|last= Eckert| first = Astrid. M.| title = The Struggle for the Files|translator = Dona Geyer| publisher = CUP| date = 2012| pages = 222}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 May 1945, these arrangements were put into effect in full, notwithstanding that the only German parties to the signed surrender document had been the German High Command. The western Allies maintained that a functioning German state had already ceased to exist, and that consequently the surrender of the German military had effected the complete termination of [[Nazi Germany]]. The protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands: Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland announced the breaking off of relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the only remaining Axis belligerent, had already denounced the German surrender and Flensburg government, and seized the German embassy in Tokyo and seven U-boats. Henceforward, although the Flensburg government had a nominated Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had no access to the diplomatic assets of the former German state and was not accorded diplomatic recognition by any of the former protecting powers or other remaining neutral countries. On 5 May Von Krosigk had dispatched [[Walter Schellenberg]] to Sweden as a personal emissary via [[Folke Bernadotte]], hoping to establish diplomatic relations and to expedite a partial surrender of German forces in Norway. This mission was overtaken by the general capitulation of all German forces, and following 8 May all further approaches from the Flensburg Government to Sweden were ignored.\n\nFormer armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] suggested that after the surrender the Flensburg government should dissolve itself. Instead D\u00f6nitz and his ministers chose to continue in hope of presiding over post-war Germany as a [[provisional government]]. Even though they could exercise no direct territorial authority, the cabinet still met daily at 10.00&nbsp;a.m. Various papers on post-war reconstruction issues were proposed to be prepared, but the Western Allies showed no sign that they might receive them. Otherwise much time was devoted to discussion of how far the symbols, medals and insignia of the Hitler regime should be retained within the Flensburg headquarters.\n\n=== Nazi war crimes ===\nSome acknowledgement of Nazi war crimes became unavoidable. The departure of the SS leadership from Flensburg opened the way for the D\u00f6nitz government to offer its own version of how the murder squads, concentration camps and killing facilities had come into being.  Their response was that all these atrocities had been undertaken in secret, and entirely by Himmler and the SS. D\u00f6nitz and Jodl issued a joint public statement \"that neither the German Wehrmacht nor the German people had knowledge of these things.\"  While this statement was mostly untrue, the consequent [[Clean Wehrmacht|myth of the \"good Wehrmacht\"]] as having been deceived and betrayed by the \"evil SS\" was to achieve wide currency for decades in post-war Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Allied perspectives ===\n\nWhile it had been agreed amongst the Allies that the Flensburg government should be accorded no official recognition, [[Winston Churchill]] proved reluctant to toe the line.  In his speech announcing victory to the British people on 8 May, Churchill specified that the surrender had been authorised by \u201cGrand Admiral D\u00f6nitz, the designated Head of the German State\u201d.<ref>{{citation | first = Winston | last = Churchill | url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/95-end-of-the-war-in-europe | title = End of the War in Europe}}</ref> Equally, following the unconditional surrender, Churchill was instrumental in urging that the Flensburg Government should not immediately be closed down, saying that he could see \"great advantages in letting things slide for a bit\". Churchill's attitude in this was conditioned by his concern that Soviet forces might seek to establish themselves in Denmark; and he saw the temporary continuation of the Flensburg government in territory under British control as establishing a bargaining counter for the British in any negotiations regarding Soviet intentions in the western Baltic, while also facilitating the disbanding of German forces.\n\nConversely, Soviet statements consistently characterised the Flensburg government as an anti-Soviet clique, pursuing a truce in the west only to maintain resistance against Soviet forces in the east. On 20 May, the government of the USSR made it clear what it thought about the Flensburg Government. It attacked the D\u00f6nitz Administration, calling it the \"D\u00f6nitz Gang\" and harshly criticised any idea of allowing it to retain any power. ''[[Pravda]]'' said:\n\n{{quote|Discussions of the status of the Fascist gang around D\u00f6nitz continue. Several prominent Allied circles will deem it necessary to make use of the \"services\" of D\u00f6nitz and his collaborators. In the British Parliament, this gang has been described as the 'D\u00f6nitz Administration'\u2026. A reporter of the reactionary [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] press has called the enlistment of D\u00f6nitz \"an act of political sagacity.\"  Thus a Fascist scribbler has seen fit to make common cause with Hitler's marauding disciple. At the same time, the Fascist press on both sides of the Atlantic has put it abroad that conditions in Germany in 1918, when German Rightists produced similar fairy-tales of impending chaos. Then, the intact German Army units were used for new adventures in the East, immediately after capitulation. The present campaign has similar objectives. Many reactionary circles around the Allies are opposed to the creation of a new Europe on the basis of the Crimea Conference. These circles consider the preservation of Fascist states and breeding grounds as a means of thwarting the democratic aspirations of all freedom-loving nations....<ref>Dollinger, Hans (1995) [1965]. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan: A Pictorial History of the Final Days of World War II'', p. 239</ref>}}\n\nGeneral Eisenhower tended rather to agree with the Soviet position (if not the reasoning behind it), suspecting that D\u00f6nitz and his cabinet could be a front, while the real German leadership, perhaps including Himmler, [[Martin Bormann]] and Hitler himself (whose remains were not then known to have been identified), remained operating behind the scenes, or otherwise plotting for their concealment and escape.  With ill-disguised reluctance Eisenhower agreed to defer to the British view for a short period, but issued a clarifying statement that the continuation of the D\u00f6nitz government did not constitute his being recognised as a head of state \"but only and temporarily under the instructions of the Allied Commanders to carry out duties concerning the feeding, disarming and medical care of the German Armed Forces.\"\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-079-31, Verhaftung von D\u00f6nitz, Speer und Jodl.jpg|thumb|Three members of the Flensburg Government, General [[Alfred Jodl]], Dr [[Albert Speer]], and Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], after their arrest by the Allies.]]\n\n=== Final dissolution of the Flensburg Government ===\n\nOn 12 May, American Major General Lowell W. Rooks and his British deputy, Brigadier E. J. Foord, arrived in Flensburg and established their quarters in the passenger ship ''Patria'', docked in Flensburg harbour, displacing the administrative offices of the Flensburg government that had been housed there. Their mission was to liaise with the D\u00f6nitz \"acting government\" (as it was then referred to by the SHAEF) and to impose the will of the victorious Allied Powers on the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]].  Although the liaison mission arranged meetings with members of the Flensburg government, these only confirmed that neither D\u00f6nitz nor his ministers had been able to establish any degree of civil authority. Churchill withdrew his protection once it became clear that the Soviet High Command would otherwise have to be represented in the liaison mission. On 21 May the SHAEF acceded to Soviet proposals that the Flensburg Government be dissolved and its members arrested as POWs.  The dissolution was carried out on 23 May. On that day, a British officer went to D\u00f6nitz's headquarters and asked to speak to the members of the government. D\u00f6nitz, von Friedeburg and Jodl were then taken aboard the ''Patria'', where Maj. Gen. Rooks informed them of the dissolution of the government; placing them under arrest, and ordering that they be stripped and searched for concealed [[wikt:phial|phials]] of poison.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/other/us-army_germany_1944-46_ch15.htm Chapter XV: The Victory Sealed].

Faced with the prospect of being strip-searched, von Friedeburg committed suicide, while D\u00f6nitz, Speer, Jodl and other members of the dissolved Flensburg Government were taken prisoner,<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\"/> under the responsibility of a [[RAF Regiment]] task force commanded by Squadron Leader Mark Hobden.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The RAF Regiment at War 1942-1946|last=Oliver|first=Kingsley M|publisher=Pen & Sword|year=|isbn=|location=Great Britain 2002|pages=118}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/10085223/Group-Captain-Mark-Hobden.html|title=Daily Telegraph|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe prisoners were later handed over to the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]]. Some Flensburg Government POWs such as Albert Speer were subsequently moved to the British POW camp ''Dustbin'' in [[Castle Kransberg]], while others, including D\u00f6nitz, were transferred to the American-led [[Camp Ashcan]]. Later, all Camp Ashcan prisoners were moved to Nuremberg to stand trial.\n\n=== Berlin Declaration: 5 June 1945 ===\n[[File:Nazi Personalities BU6713.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Speer (left), Karl D\u00f6nitz (center) and Alfred Jodl (right) after their arrest.]]\nWith the arrest of the Flensburg Government on 23 May 1945, the German High Command also ceased to exist, with no central authority having been kept in place to govern Germany even in a nominal capacity, or to assume responsibility for complying with the demands and instructions of the victorious nations. This power vacuum continued for almost two weeks until 5 June 1945, when the representatives of the Allies signed the ''[[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers]]'', also known as the ''Berlin Declaration''.<ref name=\"Declaration\">{{cite web |title=Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers; June 5, 1945 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/ger01.asp |website=Lillian Goldman Law Library |publisher=Yale Law Library |accessdate=30 November 2018 |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Die Sportschule Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik (Mai 2014), Bild 002.JPG|thumb|The Sportschool in [[M\u00fcrwik]], on the edge of the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]], the seat of the Flensburg Government.]]\nThe declaration, issued in Berlin at 18:00 on 5 June 1945, and signed by General Eisenhower on behalf of the United States, Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] on behalf of the United Kingdom, Marshal [[Georgiy Zhukov]] on behalf of the Soviet Union, and by General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] on behalf of the French Provisional Government, contained the following statement:<ref name=\"Declaration\"/>\n\n{{quote|The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of the said authority and powers does not affect the annexation of Germany.}}\n\nTherefore, from 5 June 1945, Germany did not possess a native government; complete authority and sovereignty being thereafter assumed by the Allied Military Occupation Government. The contention of the Allied Powers that the German [[state (polity)|state]] ceased to exist as of 5 June 1945 was then generally accepted, but came subsequently to be challenged in legal and political debate. In any event, the Berlin Declaration maintained the continued existence of Germany as a national territory, implying the continuation of a German nation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nDuring the initial stage of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation of Germany]], supreme authority was discharged by the Four Powers jointly for all occupation zones via the [[Allied Control Council]], so that this council was the immediate successor of the D\u00f6nitz Administration in the Government of Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany|World War II}}\n* [[End of World War II in Europe]]\n* [[German Instrument of Surrender]]\n* [[Victory Day (9 May)]]\n* [[Victory in Europe Day]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kershaw |first1=Ian  |authorlink1=Ian Kershaw |title=[[The End: Hitler's Germany 1944\u201345]] |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7139-9716-3 |ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael Jones (historian) |title=After Hitler: The Last Days of the Second World War in Europe |date=2015 |publisher=John Murray Publishers Ltd |isbn=978-1848544963 |ref = harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{German Cabinets}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Provisional governments]]\n[[Category:Government of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Historic German cabinets|Schwerin von Krosigk]]\n[[Category:Flensburg]]\n[[Category:1945 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Cabinets established in 1945]]\n[[Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Short-lived government of Nazi Germany}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox government cabinet\n| cabinet_name            = Schwerin von Krosigk Cabinet\n| jurisdiction            = Nazi Germany\n| cabinet_number          = \n| flag                    = Flag of German Reich (1935\u20131945).svg\n| incumbent               = 1945\n| image                   = Ludwig Schwerin von Krosigk.jpg\n| caption                 = \"Leading Minister\" [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] \n| date_formed             = {{start date|1945|05|02|df=yes}}\n| date_dissolved          = {{end date|1945|05|23|df=yes}} ''([[de facto]])''<br />{{end date|1945|06|05|df=yes}} ''([[de jure]])''\n| government_head         = [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]]\n| government_head_history = \n| deputy_government_head  =\n| state_head              = [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\n| current_number          =\n| former_members_number   =\n| total_number            =\n| political_party         = [[Nazi Party]]\n| legislature_status      =\n| opposition_cabinet      =\n| opposition_party        = None\n| opposition_leader       =\n| election                =\n| legislature_term        =\n| budget                  =\n| incoming_formation      =\n| outgoing_formation      =\n| previous                = [[Goebbels cabinet]]\n| successor               = [[Allied Control Council]]<br />[[First Adenauer cabinet]]<br />(from 20 September 1949)<br />[[Council of Ministers of East Germany]]<br />(from November 1950)\n}}\nThe '''Flensburg Government''' ({{lang-de|Flensburger Regierung}}), also known as the '''Flensburg Cabinet''' (''Flensburger Kabinett''), the '''D\u00f6nitz Government''' (''Regierung D\u00f6nitz''), or the '''Schwerin von Krosigk Cabinet''' (''Kabinett Schwerin von Krosigk''), was the short-lived government of [[Nazi Germany]] during a period of three weeks around the end of [[World War II]] in Europe. The government was formed following the [[suicide of Adolf Hitler]] on 30 April 1945 during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. It was headed by Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] as the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident]] and [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] as the Leading Minister.\n\nThe administration was referred to as the \"Flensburg Government\" because D\u00f6nitz's headquarters had been relocated to the port of [[Flensburg]] in northern Germany on 3 May 1945.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=88}} Due to the rapid [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] advance, its nominal jurisdiction at the outset was limited to a narrow wedge of territory running from the [[Austria]]n border through Berlin to the Danish border; which, since 25 April 1945, had been cut in two by the American advance to join with Soviet forces at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe]].  Following the capitulation of all German armed forces on 8 May, the Flensburg government lost all direct territorial, military or civil jurisdiction, and all diplomatic relations were withdrawn. The western Allies allowed the Flensburg government to continue to meet and conduct what business it could until 23 May when they arrested its members as [[prisoners of war]], effectively dissolving the government although the dissolution was not formally recognized by the Allied Powers until 5 June.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=323}}\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-127-06A, Karl D\u00f6nitz - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\n\nOnce it became apparent that Hitler intended to stay and die in the besieged city of Berlin, effective overall command of German armed forces was exercised through the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (German High Command), which had relocated to [[Rheinsburg]].  Anticipating that German-held territory would be split, separate military and civilian commands had provisionally been established on 15 April; under Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] at [[Pullach]] for forces in the south and west, and under Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] at [[Pl\u00f6n]] for forces in the north and east; but then Hitler had stalled on transferring executive military authority to them.\n\nOn 27 April [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and [[Alfred Jodl]], of the Army High Command, met at Rheinsburg with [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]] to discuss the war situation now that the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]] could not be averted. Himmler took the chair as the acknowledged deputy [[F\u00fchrer]]; and, since the disgrace and dismissal of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], Hitler's expected successor. As they were leaving Rheinsberg on 28 April, Himmler asked D\u00f6nitz to confirm that he would be willing to serve in a successor government that Himmler might form. That day however, the British and Americans published Himmler's secret proposals for a separate peace in the West (which they had rejected). On 29 April D\u00f6nitz received a telegram from [[Martin Bormann]] announcing Himmler's dismissal from all posts, and ordering his arrest for treason.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=88}} D\u00f6nitz went to Himmler's headquarters in L\u00fcbeck on 30 April to confront him with the accusations, but Himmler denied them as fabricated propaganda. When a further telegram from Bormann that day confirmed both the dismissal and D\u00f6nitz's appointment as Hitler's successor, Himmler's position became untenable, and D\u00f6nitz summoned him to Pl\u00f6n that night to tell him so.\n\n[[File:1945-05-01GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Situation of World War II in Europe at the time of Hitler\u2019s death.

The same day D\u00f6nitz accepted the offices of Supreme Commander and Head of State in separate broadcast addresses to the German armed forces, and German people.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=89}} Residual ministers of the [[Hitler Cabinet|Hitler cabinet]], who had fled from the fall of Berlin to join D\u00f6nitz at the [[Wehrmacht]] barracks near [[Pl\u00f6n]] in [[Holstein]], resigned the next day.  Suspecting that Bormann might also have escaped from Berlin and be intending to seize power, D\u00f6nitz met with Hitler's former Finance Minister [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] and asked him to constitute a new [[Cabinet of Germany|Reich government]].{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=96}}\n\nVon Krosigk's cabinet first met in [[Eutin]], to which he and his ministerial staff had been evacuated, on 2 May. Later on 2 May, and in view of the rapidly advancing British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] forces which were approaching [[L\u00fcbeck]], D\u00f6nitz met with von Krosigk, [[Paul Wegener (Gauleiter)|Paul Wegener]], Himmler and Keitel to discuss the urgent necessity of a further relocation. Himmler argued for a move to [[Prague]], then the last major central European capital city in German hands, and closer to advancing American forces with whom he hoped to negotiate personally, but D\u00f6nitz refused to sanction any move outside the borders of Germany. Moreover, the political situation of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was highly unstable. D\u00f6nitz decided instead to proceed to the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik|M\u00fcrwik naval academy]] in [[Flensburg]] near the Danish border. The cabinet met in the Sportschool of the naval academy; while administrative offices and accommodation for the various ministries were established on the liner {{Interlanguage link multi|MV Patria (1938)|de|3=Patria (Schiff, 1938)|lt=''Patria''}}, moored in Flensburg harbour.  The German High Command, which had moved from Rheinsburg to [[Neustadt in Holstein]] two days before, then also relocated to Flensburg, while the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leadership had been gathering at Flensburg since 28 April.\n\n==Cabinet==\nRetaining some members from the previous Hitler cabinet and [[Goebbels cabinet]], Karl D\u00f6nitz's government consisted of the following people:\n{{Cabinet table start|hiderefcol=y}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reichspr\u00e4sident]]\n | minister1              = [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 30 April 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = \"Leading Minister\"\n | minister1              = [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]\n | minister1              = Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community|Minister of the Interior]]\n | minister1              = [[Wilhelm Stuckart]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 6 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|Minister of Justice]]\n | minister1              = [[Otto Georg Thierack]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 24 August 1942\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = Minister of Finance\n | minister1              = Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk\n | minister1_termstart    = 1 June 1932\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = Minister of Industry and Production\n | minister1              = [[Albert Speer]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture|Minister for Food and Agriculture]]\n | minister1              = [[Herbert Backe]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1942\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[List of German labour ministers|Minister for Labour]]\n | minister1              = [[Franz Seldte]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = Minister of War\n | minister1              = [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]<ref>[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/DoenitzKarl/ Biography on dhm.de {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n | minister1_termstart    = 30 April 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Reich Ministry of Transport|Minister of Transport]]\n | minister1              = [[Julius Dorpm\u00fcller|Julius Heinrich Dorpm\u00fcller]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 February 1937\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[List of German postal ministers|Minister for Postal Affairs]]\n | minister1              = Julius Heinrich Dorpm\u00fcller\n | minister1_termstart    = 2 May 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table minister\n | title                  = [[Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production|Minister for Armaments and War Production]]\n | minister1              = [[Karl Saur]]\n | minister1_termstart    = 30 April 1945\n | minister1_termend      = 23 May 1945\n | minister1_party        = Nazi Party\n}}\n{{Cabinet table end}}\n\nD\u00f6nitz avoided including prominent Nazi leaders in his cabinet other than Speer; but included several serving officers in the SS and others who had been closely involved in formulating and prosecuting the genocidal policies of the former regime.  Herbert Backe had been the author of the [[Hunger Plan]] of 1941, a deliberate strategy for mass elimination by starvation of Soviet prisoners of war and 'surplus' Soviet urban populations. Speer's deputy in the Economics Ministry was [[Otto Ohlendorf]], who had personally directed the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Communists in occupied Soviet territory. Wilhelm Stuckart had been a participant at the [[Wannsee Conference]] of January 1942, when the administrative responsibilities for the \"[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Problem\" had been agreed.  Otto Ohlendorf had transferred across directly from directing Himmler's office as [[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]; and overall, of 350 staff working in the offices of the Flensburg government, 230 had been members of the SS or other security services.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}} D\u00f6nitz's cabinet picks were clearly circumscribed by who was available. Otherwise, and in spite of his subsequent claim that his government was 'unpolitical', the most consistent characteristic of those chosen was a virulent opposition to Bolshevism, and a determination to ensure that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolutionary events]] in Germany attending the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of 1918]] would not be repeated in 1945. As D\u00f6nitz did not then intend any surrender to the Soviets or Poles and continued to identify \"Jews and profiteers\u201d as enemies of the German people, he had little compunction over including in his cabinet men with blood on their hands, so long as that blood was Russian, Eastern European or Jewish.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}}\n\nFor the first few days the post of Minister of the Interior was kept vacant.  This had been the office of [[Heinrich Himmler]], but Himmler had been condemned as a traitor, dismissed from all functions and ordered to be arrested in [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Last Testament]]. D\u00f6nitz did not want Himmler's name associated with his new government, but nor could he afford to alienate the SS who remained armed and powerful. He tacitly set Hitler's instructions aside and continued to see Himmler on a daily basis without according him any formal appointment. It was only on 6 May 1945, while final negotiations were in prospect for a capitulation to U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the west, that D\u00f6nitz dismissed Himmler from all his posts, and appointed Stuckart in his place.\n\n=== Armed forces High Command ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H30220, Wilhelm Keitel.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilhelm Keitel]]\nD\u00f6nitz had hoped to be able to appoint Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]] as Commander in Chief of the Army and Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]), to which the Army High Command ([[Oberkommando des Heeres]]) had been subject since 28 April 1945, but he could not be contacted on 2 May, and so Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] was kept in post; and in this capacity Keitel signed the act of surrender for the German High Command in Berlin on 8 May. A further factor favouring the continuation of Keitel as Commander in Chief, was the support for him of [[Colonel General]] [[Alfred Jodl]], the Chief of Operations Staff of the ''Wehrmacht'', whose retention D\u00f6nitz recognised as essential. Jodl was to represent D\u00f6nitz in negotiations with the Allies in [[Reims]], France. Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]] was appointed to succeed D\u00f6nitz as Commander of the [[Kriegsmarine]], and was promoted by D\u00f6nitz to the rank of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' on 1 May. The Air Force had largely been destroyed or grounded due to lack of fuel, so no new appointment was made, Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] remaining Commander of the [[Luftwaffe]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=360}}\n\nIn spite of its repeated relocations, the Armed Forces High Command continued to function, its organisation and structures having been maintained. But the same was not true of any other arm of government. Starting in March 1945, the staff of the various ministries had been evacuated to resort hotels in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps \u2013 chiefly in the region of [[Berchtesgaden]], leaving only the ministers themselves in Berlin. On 13 April, the remaining foreign embassies and the diplomatic corps were evacuated to [[Bad Gastein]]. Finally on 20 April all the ministers and their personal staffs had been ordered to make their way southwards; but as by then the roads had been cut and there were insufficient transport aircraft available, several ministers (like von Krosigk) had perforce headed north instead. Thus the government of Germany was, at the death of Hitler, split over six centres. The [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]], the personal fiefdom of [[Joseph Goebbels]] had remained with him in Berlin, as had the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]] under [[Martin Bormann]]; while the [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe High Command]] had relocated to Berchtesgaden, having been until his abrupt dismissal on 23 April the counterpart fiefdom of G\u00f6ring. Himmler had retained his personal powerbase in the offices of the SS and security apparatus, which had been established in L\u00fcbeck in the north and then relocated to Flensburg. Other government ministries and ministers were then variously located at Berchtesgaden and D\u00f6nitz's headquarters in Pl\u00f6n. With the Armed Forces High Command also located in the north \u2013 although many OKW personnel had gone south \u2013 there was, in consequence, no semblance any longer of a German central government, and most of the members of von Krosigk's cabinet lacked any support staff from their nominal ministries.\n\n==Actions==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99621, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|upright|Heinrich Himmler]]\nD\u00f6nitz's initial priority was to open communication with the commanders of German armies, and to establish with them their acknowledgement of his new authority as sole Supreme Commander of all German armed forces. He also sought their agreement with his overall policy of negotiating successive partial surrenders with the Western Allies, while maintaining the war against Soviet forces in the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=362}} Key to this was sidelining [[Heinrich Himmler]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}} [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=361}} [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and other former Nazi grandees who had fled to Flensburg, but whose continued participation in government would preclude any negotiation with the western Allies. D\u00f6nitz's intentions in this were, if possible, to split the Allies, and to offer German military units as components of a common anti-Bolshevik front. Failing that, he sought to save as many German soldiers as possible from Soviet captivity by ordering units in the east to retreat westwards and surrender to the British, Canadians or Americans, and by redoubling [[Operation Hannibal]], the maritime evacuation of units trapped on the Baltic coast. At D\u00f6nitz's urging, Field Marshal Keitel and General Jodl attempted to direct what was left of the Wehrmacht towards these goals.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{citation | publisher = iBiblio | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450506a.html#1 | title = The German Surrender Documents \u2013 WWII}}</ref> On 2 May, D\u00f6nitz obtained pledges of allegiance from the commanders of German armies in Norway, Courland, East Prussia and Bohemia; these pledges were made to him personally as Supreme Commander, and not as Head of State in a forthcoming government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=352}}\n\nOtherwise however, D\u00f6nitz's policies chiefly demonstrated continuity with the previous regime. The Nazi party was neither banned nor dissolved. D\u00f6nitz kept a bust of Hitler in his office; and the uniforms, insignia and protocol of Nazi Germany were maintained, initially including even the '[[Nazi salute|Heil Hitler]]' greeting. Following a plea from Speer, D\u00f6nitz on 2 May rescinded the infamous '[[Nero Decree]]' ordering [[scorched earth]] destruction of German infrastructure and industrial plants; but it was not until 6 May that counterpart destruction orders were rescinded for those territories remaining under German occupation, such as Norway. Moreover, neither summary courts for civil punishment, nor military discipline by summary courts martial were abolished; with military executions for insulting the memory of Hitler being confirmed even after the final capitulation on 8 May.\n\nWhile the presence of SS leaders and their staffs in Flensburg had provided D\u00f6nitz with a source of personnel to support his government, otherwise they presented problems. In particular, the SS leadership had access to armed forces that were not under D\u00f6nitz's control, and remained firmly loyal to Himmler, whom D\u00f6nitz had surmised was personally unacceptable now to both the Western Allies and to the Wehrmacht. D\u00f6nitz handled the issue by stringing Himmler along for as long as he could with vague prospects of a possible function in the government. Once serious negotiations were underway for surrender to Eisenhower, Himmler and the SS apparatus had to be got out of the way. On 5 May 1945 D\u00f6nitz informed Himmler of his forthcoming dismissal, promising false papers and identities for him and his leading lieutenants if they removed themselves promptly. Himmler called his fellow SS leaders together for a last time that day, and advised them to 'dive down within the Wehrmacht'. By the next day they had fled.\n\nThis came too late for the concentration camp prisoners within the area who were now within D\u00f6nitz's nominal authority, while under the actual control of the SS. These had numbered around 10,000 when D\u00f6nitz assumed the presidency; mainly former inmates of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg, which had been shut down in preparation for the surrender of the city to the British. Between 16 and 28 April, the prisoners had been moved eastwards and concealed by the SS in a flotilla of unseaworthy ships anchored in the [[Bay of L\u00fcbeck]], where they then remained without food or medical attention. At the time, this action had been protested by Rear Admiral Konrad Englehardt on D\u00f6nitz's staff, but when the Flensburg government came into being, D\u00f6nitz made no attempt to free the prisoners, and his government avoided any subsequent acknowledgement that they had known they were there. On 3 May 1945, the prison flotilla was sunk by the Royal Air Force in the mistaken belief that the ships were being prepared to evacuate leading SS personnel. Over 7,000 prisoners drowned, mainly on the former liner ''[[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]]''.\n\n=== Partial capitulations in the West ===\n\nOn 2 May, while still at Pl\u00f6n, D\u00f6nitz was surprised to learn that German forces in Italy had surrendered unconditionally to the Western Allies. The capitulation had been negotiated without Hitler's knowledge or consent, and signed at [[Surrender of Caserta|Caserta]] on 29 April but did not come into effect for three days. While Hitler had been still alive, D\u00f6nitz had followed absolutely his commands to fight on to the last on all fronts. However, he now realized that the Wehrmacht's position in the West was untenable. He believed that surrendering German forces only to the Western Allies could present opportunities to split the British and Americans from the Soviets. Thereon he assumed direction of further German surrender initiatives, exploring opportunities for partial surrender in the West. In the East, however, he continued to order German armies to fight on. On 2 May, he tried unsuccessfully to countermand the decisions of the German commander in [[Berlin]] to surrender their forces to the Soviets; and on 3 May, issued orders to the besieged defenders of Courland and Breslau to maintain their resistance.\n\n[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|thumb|upright|Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery]]\nOn 3 May D\u00f6nitz sent Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]], his successor as naval commander in chief, to the headquarters of British Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] at [[L\u00fcneburg]], with an offer to surrender of German forces in northwest Germany, together with the remaining elements of [[Army Group Vistula]]. Montgomery informed Admiral von Friedeburg that he could not accept the surrender of forces fighting on the Eastern Front; and that consequently Army Group Vistula would have to surrender to the Soviets although British forces would accept the surrender of any German soldiers fleeing westwards. He proposed instead, following discussions between Eisenhower and the British government, that he would accept the surrender of all German military forces in Northwestern Germany, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], the Netherlands and Denmark, including naval forces and warships in those areas. Von Friedeburg asked for 48 hours to consider this; Montgomery allowed him 24. The proposed inclusion of Denmark, and the German warships operating there, initially alarmed D\u00f6nitz, who wished at all costs to maintain [[Operation Hannibal]], evacuating German troops across the Baltic to Danish ports; but on consideration, he reckoned he might secretly evade the obligation to surrender these ships if they were at sea on the date the surrender came into effect. Furthermore, as it was unlikely that Montgomery would promptly be able to deploy British forces to the Danish islands under German occupation, especially [[Bornholm]] in the central Baltic, there was every possibility that the evacuation proceeding there could continue in total disregard of the agreed surrender terms. Consequently, authorized by D\u00f6nitz, von Friedeburg returned on 4 May and signed an instrument of surrender for all German troops and ships in the Netherlands, Denmark and Northwestern Germany. This was accepted by Montgomery on behalf of Eisenhower.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=367}} This 4 May surrender would become effective at 8:00&nbsp;am on 5 May; so D\u00f6nitz ordered all ships involved in Operation Hannibal to undertake a covert final evacuation voyage, while also unilaterally ordering all U-boat actions to cease. One crew in the evacuation fleet refused to set sail; so D\u00f6nitz ordered the ringleaders to be arrested for mutiny, tried by summary court martial, and shot.\n\nAlso, on 5 May 1945, all German forces in Bavaria and South West Germany signed an act of surrender to the Americans at [[Army Group G|Haar]], outside Munich; coming into effect on 6 May. Montgomery, always seeking to boost his own public standing at the expense of other Allied commanders, had arranged extensive media coverage of the 4 May signing, but D\u00f6nitz and von Krosigk realised that, although he had supplied von Friedeburg with a prepared German text of the surrender documents, Montgomery had failed to issue this to the press. They consequently broadcast their own, doctored, German version; which differed significantly from that signed; specifically in that warships in the Baltic were not included nor was the territory in Schleswig around Flensburg itself; and especially, the surrender was described as a 'truce', not a capitulation. As was D\u00f6nitz's intention, this broadcast exacerbated Stalin's suspicions of the partial capitulations, especially as the greater parts of the [[3rd Panzer Army]] and [[21st Army (Wehrmacht)|21st Army]] had indeed been able to surrender to the British and Americans, rather than the Soviets. Realising this, Eisenhower determined that no further partial capitulations would be negotiated.\n\nThe capitulations at Luneberg and Haar could do nothing however for the bulk of German forces in [[Army Group Centre]], fighting the Soviets in [[Bohemia]] and [[Saxony]]. On 4 May D\u00f6nitz, together with [[Karl Hermann Frank|Karl Frank]] the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, conceived of a device whereby Army Group Centre might be able to surrender to General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s American forces, who had been entering the [[Sudetenland]] areas of former [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] from the west, and approaching [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]]. D\u00f6nitz proposed that Frank should dissolve the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and resign in favour of a puppet Czech government; who would then declare [[Prague]] an [[open city]] and invite the Americans in. General Patton's virulent anti-communist views were well known to the German leadership, who reckoned that with Patton in Prague it would become much easier for Army Group Centre to negotiate surrender terms with him while maintaining their resistance to the Soviets, if possible dragging American and Soviet armies into direct confrontation. Frank had hopes that \"we can engineer a disagreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union even more serious than that of Poland\". The ploy was proposed as being put into effect on 5 May, but was overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Prague uprising]] on that date; and over the succeeding three days, far from surrendering Prague as an open city, SS forces launched a savage response to the insurgents, with brutal reprisals against Czech civilians and widespread destruction in central Prague. Orders to fire-bomb the whole of the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] were only averted due to lack of fuel for Luftwaffe bombing units. Alerted to the German machinations through intercepted [[Ultra]] signals, Eisenhower ordered Patton to stand still in Pilsen in spite of ever more desperate calls for help from the insurgents. Prague was finally relieved by General [[Ivan Konev|Konev]]'s forces on 9 May 1945.\n\n=== General capitulation on all fronts ===\n[[File:Meeting of the Supreme Command.jpg|thumb|SHAEF commanders at a conference in London]]\nFollowing the success of the two partial surrenders of 4 and 5 May, D\u00f6nitz instructed von Friedeburg to go to the [[Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) to negotiate with General Eisenhower terms for a general surrender of all remaining German armies to the Western Allies.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=369}} Since von Friedeburg's meeting with Montgomery, Eisenhower's opposition to accepting a German surrender that excluded the Soviet Union had been made clear to the German High Command, but D\u00f6nitz hoped to change his mind.\n\nOn the next day, 5 May, von Friedeburg arrived at General Eisenhower's headquarters at [[Reims]], France, but learned that Eisenhower was resolute that only a total surrender on all fronts to all the Allies could be discussed. Jodl arrived a day later, ostensibly to sign such a general surrender. D\u00f6nitz had instructed him to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could move west to surrender to the Western Powers. Eisenhower made it clear that the Allies demanded immediate unconditional surrender on all fronts. When it became obvious that the Germans were stalling, Eisenhower threatened to close the western front to all surrendering Germans from the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=371}} Had this happened, German soldiers attempting to cross the line to surrender would be fired on and all subsequent surrenders would have to be to the Soviets. When D\u00f6nitz learned this, he radioed Jodl [[full powers]] to sign the unconditional [[German Instrument of Surrender]] at 1.30&nbsp;am on the morning of 7 May. Just over an hour later, Jodl signed the documents. The surrender documents included the phrase, \"The German High Command will at once issue orders to all German military, naval and air authorities and to all forces under German control to cease active operations at 2301 hours Central European time on 8 May and to remain in the positions occupied at that time.\" The Western Allies had a unified command structure, and formed a single expeditionary force, the \"Allied Expeditionary Force\". U.S. Army General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] (Eisenhower's chief of staff at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Western Allies, and General [[Ivan Susloparov]] (the Soviet liaison officer at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Soviets. French Major General [[Fran\u00e7ois Sevez]] signed as the official witness.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nAlthough Eisenhower had sought to keep General [[Aleksei Antonov]] of the Soviet High Command fully informed of the progress of the surrender negotiations, no confirmation had been received from the Soviets that the text of the Act of Military Surrender was acceptable to them, or that Susloparov was empowered to sign it. Accordingly, Eisenhower extracted from Jodl an additional signed undertaking that the Chief of the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]], and the Commanders in Chief of all three German armed services would attend in person and sign a \"formal ratification\" of the Act of Military Surrender, at a place and date to be specified.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Some six hours after the signing, a response came from Antonov that terms of surrender were unacceptable, and that Susloparov could not sign it. Eisenhower promptly agreed, and undertook to attend together with the rest of the SHAEF for the definitive signing in Berlin two days later. Antonov's response also noted that von Friedeburg had been referring matters back to D\u00f6nitz over the radio; and that D\u00f6nitz, in direct breach of the signed surrender terms, had still not issued orders for German forces in the east to remain in their positions but was instead instructing them to continue their resistance and flee westwards. Antonov stated that, while the internal discussions of the German military in no way obligated the Allied Powers, Jodl's signature could not be accepted as valid if he was doing so as D\u00f6nitz's representative since D\u00f6nitz himself was clearly acting in bad faith. He proposed that the definitive act of surrender should make it clear that the Commanders in Chief of each of the German armed services were, in signing it, surrendering their forces on the authority of the German High Command - and not as delegated by D\u00f6nitz or the purported Flensburg government.\n\nA second, amended, instrument of surrender was accordingly signed at Karlshorst, Berlin on 8 May shortly before midnight.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=372}} Marshal Zhukov signed for the Soviet High Command, and the British Marshal of the [[Royal Air Force]] [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|A.W. Tedder]] signed on behalf of the Western Allies (Tedder acted as Eisenhower's representative at the Berlin ceremony, and signed \"on behalf of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force\", in his capacity as Deputy Supreme Commander). French General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] and [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]] signed as the official witnesses.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The Allies had demanded that representatives of the German Army, Navy and Air Force, and the High Command of the Armed Forces, sign the ratification of unconditional surrender, and that they should present full powers authorizing them to do so on behalf of the German High Command.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Complying with that demand D\u00f6nitz issued a telegraphed communication from his \"Supreme Commander Headquarters\" (''Der Oberste Befehlshaber Hauptquartier'') granting the necessary full powers,<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>The text of the full powers, in German, was as follows: A b s c h r i f t.

DONITZ GRO\u00dfADMIRAL.

At the time specified, [[end of World War II in Europe|World War II in Europe ended]]. On 9 May, D\u00f6nitz issued orders to the German Armed Forces regarding the military surrender.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=376}}\n\nThe text of the definitive surrender document signed in Berlin differed from that previously signed at Reims, chiefly in that, to the second article, was added the words \"..and to disarm completely, handing over their weapons and equipment to the local allied commanders or officers designated by the Representatives of the Allied Supreme Command\"; which had the effect of requiring German troop facing Soviet forces to hand over their weapons, disband and give themselves up as prisoners. Otherwise neither the Reims nor Berlin surrender instruments provided explicitly for the surrender of the German State, because the draft surrender document prepared by the [[European Advisory Commission]] (EAC) was not used. Instead, a simplified, military-only version had been produced by the SHAEF, based largely on the wording of the partial surrender instrument of German forces in Italy that had been signed at Caserta. This definition of the surrender as an act of military capitulation side-stepped any Allied recognition of the German Government, or of D\u00f6nitz as Head of State. The question of the civil effects of the unconditional surrender was only settled later, when the Allies decided to dissolve the Flensburg Government (23 May) and issued the Berlin declaration, proclaiming the direct assumption of the supreme governmental authority in Germany by the Allied Powers (5 June). The text of the Berlin Declaration was widely based on the EAC's draft instrument of surrender of Germany. The said draft was reworked into a unilateral declaration with an extended explanatory preamble, that spelled out the Allied position that as a result of its complete defeat Germany had been left without a government, a vacuum that the direct assumption of supreme authority by the Allies would replace.\n\n==Dissolution==\n\n=== Withdrawal of diplomatic recognition ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Schellenberg]]\nDuring 1944 and 1945 countries that had been neutral or allies of Germany had been joining the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] and declaring war on Germany.  The German embassies to these countries had been closed down, and their property and archives held in trust by a nominated [[protecting power]] (usually [[Switzerland]] or [[Sweden]]) under the terms of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. There were counterpart arrangements for the former embassies of Allied countries in Berlin. The [[United States Department of State]] had prepared for the diplomatic consequences of the war ending on the assumption that there would have been an explicit statement of unconditional surrender of the German state in accordance with the terms of a draft surrender text jointly agreed by the Allied powers in 1944. In the final days of April 1945 the State Department had notified the protecting powers, and all other remaining neutral governments (such as [[Ireland]]), that following the forthcoming German surrender the continued identity of the German state would rest solely in the four Allied Powers. The Allied Powers would immediately recall all German diplomatic staff, take ownership of all German state property, extinguish all protecting power functions, and require the transfer of all archives and records to one or another of the embassies of the western Allies.<ref name=\"Eckert 2012\">{{cite book|last= Eckert| first = Astrid. M.| title = The Struggle for the Files|translator = Dona Geyer| publisher = CUP| date = 2012| pages = 222}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 May 1945, these arrangements were put into effect in full, notwithstanding that the only German parties to the signed surrender document had been the German High Command. The western Allies maintained that a functioning German state had already ceased to exist, and that consequently the surrender of the German military had effected the complete termination of [[Nazi Germany]]. The protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands: Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland announced the breaking off of relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the only remaining Axis belligerent, had already denounced the German surrender and Flensburg government, and seized the German embassy in Tokyo and seven U-boats. Henceforward, although the Flensburg government had a nominated Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had no access to the diplomatic assets of the former German state and was not accorded diplomatic recognition by any of the former protecting powers or other remaining neutral countries. On 5 May Von Krosigk had dispatched [[Walter Schellenberg]] to Sweden as a personal emissary via [[Folke Bernadotte]], hoping to establish diplomatic relations and to expedite a partial surrender of German forces in Norway. This mission was overtaken by the general capitulation of all German forces, and following 8 May all further approaches from the Flensburg Government to Sweden were ignored.\n\nFormer armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] suggested that after the surrender the Flensburg government should dissolve itself. Instead D\u00f6nitz and his ministers chose to continue in hope of presiding over post-war Germany as a [[provisional government]]. Even though they could exercise no direct territorial authority, the cabinet still met daily at 10.00&nbsp;a.m. Various papers on post-war reconstruction issues were proposed to be prepared, but the Western Allies showed no sign that they might receive them. Otherwise much time was devoted to discussion of how far the symbols, medals and insignia of the Hitler regime should be retained within the Flensburg headquarters.\n\n=== Nazi war crimes ===\nSome acknowledgement of Nazi war crimes became unavoidable. The departure of the SS leadership from Flensburg opened the way for the D\u00f6nitz government to offer its own version of how the murder squads, concentration camps and killing facilities had come into being.  Their response was that all these atrocities had been undertaken in secret, and entirely by Himmler and the SS. D\u00f6nitz and Jodl issued a joint public statement \"that neither the German Wehrmacht nor the German people had knowledge of these things.\"  While this statement was mostly untrue, the consequent [[Clean Wehrmacht|myth of the \"good Wehrmacht\"]] as having been deceived and betrayed by the \"evil SS\" was to achieve wide currency for decades in post-war Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Allied perspectives ===\n\nWhile it had been agreed amongst the Allies that the Flensburg government should be accorded no official recognition, [[Winston Churchill]] proved reluctant to toe the line.  In his speech announcing victory to the British people on 8 May, Churchill specified that the surrender had been authorised by \u201cGrand Admiral D\u00f6nitz, the designated Head of the German State\u201d.<ref>{{citation | first = Winston | last = Churchill | url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/95-end-of-the-war-in-europe | title = End of the War in Europe}}</ref> Equally, following the unconditional surrender, Churchill was instrumental in urging that the Flensburg Government should not immediately be closed down, saying that he could see \"great advantages in letting things slide for a bit\". Churchill's attitude in this was conditioned by his concern that Soviet forces might seek to establish themselves in Denmark; and he saw the temporary continuation of the Flensburg government in territory under British control as establishing a bargaining counter for the British in any negotiations regarding Soviet intentions in the western Baltic, while also facilitating the disbanding of German forces.\n\nConversely, Soviet statements consistently characterised the Flensburg government as an anti-Soviet clique, pursuing a truce in the west only to maintain resistance against Soviet forces in the east. On 20 May, the government of the USSR made it clear what it thought about the Flensburg Government. It attacked the D\u00f6nitz Administration, calling it the \"D\u00f6nitz Gang\" and harshly criticised any idea of allowing it to retain any power. ''[[Pravda]]'' said:\n\n{{quote|Discussions of the status of the Fascist gang around D\u00f6nitz continue. Several prominent Allied circles will deem it necessary to make use of the \"services\" of D\u00f6nitz and his collaborators. In the British Parliament, this gang has been described as the 'D\u00f6nitz Administration'\u2026. A reporter of the reactionary [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] press has called the enlistment of D\u00f6nitz \"an act of political sagacity.\"  Thus a Fascist scribbler has seen fit to make common cause with Hitler's marauding disciple. At the same time, the Fascist press on both sides of the Atlantic has put it abroad that conditions in Germany in 1918, when German Rightists produced similar fairy-tales of impending chaos. Then, the intact German Army units were used for new adventures in the East, immediately after capitulation. The present campaign has similar objectives. Many reactionary circles around the Allies are opposed to the creation of a new Europe on the basis of the Crimea Conference. These circles consider the preservation of Fascist states and breeding grounds as a means of thwarting the democratic aspirations of all freedom-loving nations....<ref>Dollinger, Hans (1995) [1965]. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan: A Pictorial History of the Final Days of World War II'', p. 239</ref>}}\n\nGeneral Eisenhower tended rather to agree with the Soviet position (if not the reasoning behind it), suspecting that D\u00f6nitz and his cabinet could be a front, while the real German leadership, perhaps including Himmler, [[Martin Bormann]] and Hitler himself (whose remains were not then known to have been identified), remained operating behind the scenes, or otherwise plotting for their concealment and escape.  With ill-disguised reluctance Eisenhower agreed to defer to the British view for a short period, but issued a clarifying statement that the continuation of the D\u00f6nitz government did not constitute his being recognised as a head of state \"but only and temporarily under the instructions of the Allied Commanders to carry out duties concerning the feeding, disarming and medical care of the German Armed Forces.\"\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-079-31, Verhaftung von D\u00f6nitz, Speer und Jodl.jpg|thumb|Three members of the Flensburg Government, General [[Alfred Jodl]], Dr [[Albert Speer]], and Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], after their arrest by the Allies.]]\n\n=== Final dissolution of the Flensburg Government ===\n\nOn 12 May, American Major General Lowell W. Rooks and his British deputy, Brigadier E. J. Foord, arrived in Flensburg and established their quarters in the passenger ship ''Patria'', docked in Flensburg harbour, displacing the administrative offices of the Flensburg government that had been housed there. Their mission was to liaise with the D\u00f6nitz \"acting government\" (as it was then referred to by the SHAEF) and to impose the will of the victorious Allied Powers on the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]].  Although the liaison mission arranged meetings with members of the Flensburg government, these only confirmed that neither D\u00f6nitz nor his ministers had been able to establish any degree of civil authority. Churchill withdrew his protection once it became clear that the Soviet High Command would otherwise have to be represented in the liaison mission. On 21 May the SHAEF acceded to Soviet proposals that the Flensburg Government be dissolved and its members arrested as POWs.  The dissolution was carried out on 23 May. On that day, a British officer went to D\u00f6nitz's headquarters and asked to speak to the members of the government. D\u00f6nitz, von Friedeburg and Jodl were then taken aboard the ''Patria'', where Maj. Gen. Rooks informed them of the dissolution of the government; placing them under arrest, and ordering that they be stripped and searched for concealed [[wikt:phial|phials]] of poison.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/other/us-army_germany_1944-46_ch15.htm Chapter XV: The Victory Sealed].

Rooks, and an official interpreter was also present at the proceedings, that were photographed.<ref name=\"trove.nla.gov.au\"/> By the time D\u00f6nitz emerged from the ship, the town's main street was filled with British tanks and troops rounding up the Germans. Faced with the prospect of being strip-searched, von Friedeburg committed suicide, while D\u00f6nitz, Speer, Jodl and other members of the dissolved Flensburg Government were taken prisoner,<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\"/> under the responsibility of a [[RAF Regiment]] task force commanded by Squadron Leader Mark Hobden.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The RAF Regiment at War 1942-1946|last=Oliver|first=Kingsley M|publisher=Pen & Sword|year=|isbn=|location=Great Britain 2002|pages=118}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/10085223/Group-Captain-Mark-Hobden.html|title=Daily Telegraph|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe prisoners were later handed over to the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]]. Some Flensburg Government POWs such as Albert Speer were subsequently moved to the British POW camp ''Dustbin'' in [[Castle Kransberg]], while others, including D\u00f6nitz, were transferred to the American-led [[Camp Ashcan]]. Later, all Camp Ashcan prisoners were moved to Nuremberg to stand trial.\n\n=== Berlin Declaration: 5 June 1945 ===\n[[File:Nazi Personalities BU6713.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Speer (left), Karl D\u00f6nitz (center) and Alfred Jodl (right) after their arrest.]]\nWith the arrest of the Flensburg Government on 23 May 1945, the German High Command also ceased to exist, with no central authority having been kept in place to govern Germany even in a nominal capacity, or to assume responsibility for complying with the demands and instructions of the victorious nations. This power vacuum continued for almost two weeks until 5 June 1945, when the representatives of the Allies signed the ''[[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers]]'', also known as the ''Berlin Declaration''.<ref name=\"Declaration\">{{cite web |title=Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers; June 5, 1945 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/ger01.asp |website=Lillian Goldman Law Library |publisher=Yale Law Library |accessdate=30 November 2018 |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Die Sportschule Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik (Mai 2014), Bild 002.JPG|thumb|The Sportschool in [[M\u00fcrwik]], on the edge of the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]], the seat of the Flensburg Government.]]\nThe declaration, issued in Berlin at 18:00 on 5 June 1945, and signed by General Eisenhower on behalf of the United States, Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] on behalf of the United Kingdom, Marshal [[Georgiy Zhukov]] on behalf of the Soviet Union, and by General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] on behalf of the French Provisional Government, contained the following statement:<ref name=\"Declaration\"/>\n\n{{quote|The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of the said authority and powers does not affect the annexation of Germany.}}\n\nTherefore, from 5 June 1945, Germany did not possess a native government; complete authority and sovereignty being thereafter assumed by the Allied Military Occupation Government. The contention of the Allied Powers that the German [[state (polity)|state]] ceased to exist as of 5 June 1945 was then generally accepted, but came subsequently to be challenged in legal and political debate. In any event, the Berlin Declaration maintained the continued existence of Germany as a national territory, implying the continuation of a German nation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nDuring the initial stage of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation of Germany]], supreme authority was discharged by the Four Powers jointly for all occupation zones via the [[Allied Control Council]], so that this council was the immediate successor of the D\u00f6nitz Administration in the Government of Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany|World War II}}\n* [[End of World War II in Europe]]\n* [[German Instrument of Surrender]]\n* [[Victory Day (9 May)]]\n* [[Victory in Europe Day]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kershaw |first1=Ian  |authorlink1=Ian Kershaw |title=[[The End: Hitler's Germany 1944\u201345]] |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7139-9716-3 |ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael Jones (historian) |title=After Hitler: The Last Days of the Second World War in Europe |date=2015 |publisher=John Murray Publishers Ltd |isbn=978-1848544963 |ref = harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{German Cabinets}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Provisional governments]]\n[[Category:Government of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Historic German cabinets|Schwerin von Krosigk]]\n[[Category:Flensburg]]\n[[Category:1945 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Cabinets established in 1945]]\n[[Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Ralph23", "label": "safe", "comment": "Incorrect comma placements; incorrect use of semicolons", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flensburg_Government"}

It is located in '''[[Kalaw Township]]''' which is part of '''[[Taunggyi District]]'''. \nIt lies at the elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to '''[[Yangon]]''', '''[[Mandalay]]''', '''[[Karen State]]''' and '''[[Mon State]]'''.\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by '''[[Kanbawza Bank]]'''.\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named Mingalar Lake in Bahtoo Park. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of '''[[Kanbawza Bank]]''' and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through Aungpan is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place.

As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's Pindaya exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by KBZ bank.\n\nThe Aungpan-Loikaw railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to Loikaw was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of Kalaw as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on Kalaw that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named Mingalar Lake in Bahtoo Park. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of KBZ bank and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through Aungpan is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation.

The son of [[Balian of Ibelin]] and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem]], he had close ties with the nobility of both [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Jerusalem]], since he was the half-brother of Queen [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]].  Before he was 20, he was appointed [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]], and a few years later became lord of [[Beirut]], where he rebuilt the city after Saladin's conquest, and established the grand Ibelin family palace. He served as regent for two of his young relatives, Isabella's daughter [[Maria of Montferrat]] from 1205 to 1210, and then [[Henry I of Cyprus]] from 1228 until Henry came of age in 1232.  John was known as a principled man, and was seen as the natural leader of the Christian barons in the Holy Land. He resisted the power-seeking of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in Cyprus, and opposed the imperial forces until Henry came of age.\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the son of [[Balian of Ibelin|Balian]], Lord of [[Nablus]] and [[Lordship of Ibelin|Ibelin]], and [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]]. By 1198 he had become [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]]; the fact that he was the half-brother of [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem]] gave him considerable influence. At the time he was a vassal of [[Ralph of Tiberias]], who was exiled from the kingdom after being accused of attempting to assassinate king [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric II]]. John attempted to mediate but Amalric would not back down.\n\n==Lord of Beirut==\nSometime before 1205 John relinquished the office of constable in exchange for the lordship of [[Beirut]], which became the home of the Ibelin family for the rest of the century. He rebuilt the city, which had been completely destroyed during [[Saladin]]'s conquest of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem kingdom]]. He also constructed an opulent palace with art from both Muslim and Byzantine influences.  A German ambassador in 1212, Wilbrand of Oldenburg, wrote an impressive account of the castle, describing [[fresco]] paintings, mosaics on the floors, and a marble fountain in the courtyard.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Crusades|author=Kenneth Setton|pages=142&ndash;143|year=1985|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09144-6| quote=The Ibelin palace of Beirut, which took away the breath of a German ambassador to the east, shows Moslem and Byzantine influences.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Crusader Art in the Holy Land|author=Folda, Jaroslav|isbn=978-0-521-83583-1 |year=2005 | publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> Historian Peter Edbury described the ambassador's account as \"A feature of the public rooms were the ''[[Trompe-l'oeil]]'' effects achieved with marble inlays, with a floor resembling the sea and a ceiling 'painted with such life-like colours that clouds pass across, the west wind blows, and there the sun seems to mark out the year and the months, the days and the weeks, the hours and the moments by its movement in the zodiac'. A marble fountain with a dragon as the centre-piece stood in the central hall, its jets cooling the air and the murmur of the water giving an altogether soothing effect.\" The castle was so well fortified, that in 1231\u20131232, it withstood a siege lasting several months.<ref name=edbury-29>Edbury, p. 29</ref>\n\nBeirut was effectively an independent state under John's rule; in 1207 John added [[Arsuf]] to his territory through his marriage to [[Melisende of Arsuf]], making him one of the wealthiest nobles in the kingdom.<ref name=edbury-29/>\n\n==Regent==\n\nFrom 1205 to 1210 John served as [[regent]] in [[Akko|Acre]], the new capital of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem#Disaster and recovery|Kingdom of Jerusalem]], for [[Maria of Montferrat]], Queen Isabella I's daughter. As regent, John helped arrange the marriage of Amalric II's son [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] to [[Alice of Cyprus|Alice of Champagne]], daughter of Amalric's predecessor as [[King of Jerusalem]], [[Henry II of Champagne]]. In 1210 he also helped arrange Maria of Montferrat's marriage to [[John of Brienne]], who was suggested by king [[Philip II of France]].\n\nBy 1217 John and his brother Philip of Ibelin had become involved in the politics of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] as well. They had apparently alienated themselves from John of Brienne, but the two represented Cyprus at a council in Acre, which met to plan for the arrival of the [[Fifth Crusade]].  When Hugh I died in 1218, Philip became regent for Hugh's son [[Henry I of Cyprus]], Philip's nephew.  When Philip died in 1228, John took over the same office.  Although both Philip and John were closely related to Henry I, as his uncles, they were still opposed on Cyprus by supporters of the [[Lusignan]] family, of which Henry was also a member; another of his uncles, [[Guy of Lusignan]], and father Amalric, were the first two kings of Cyprus.\n\n==Battle for Cyprus==\n{{see also|War of the Lombards}}\nIn 1228, the power struggle was amplified when [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] arrived in Cyprus on the [[Sixth Crusade]]. Frederick was connected to the Jerusalem nobles by being married to [[Yolande of Jerusalem|Isabella II]], John of Brienne's daughter, and Frederick attempted to use this to take power.  He claimed the kingship of Jerusalem and the overlordship of Cyprus, as well as John of Ibelin's lordship of Beirut, which John naturally refused. When lured to a banquet and then confronted with Frederick's armed guards, John was forced to hand over the regency, and Cyprus, to Emperor Frederick's control. However, this was temporary, as John later resisted with military force.  After Frederick departed from the island in April, John's forces defeated the remaining imperial bailiffs in a battle outside [[Nicosia]] on July 14, 1229, thus beginning the [[War of the Lombards]]. Frederick sent an army in 1231, under the marshal of the Empire, which attempted to invade Cyprus. John was able to repel the invasion at the [[Battle of Agridi]], but the imperial fleet sailed to John's power center of Beirut, which they besieged and almost captured. The imperial marshal, [[Richard Filangieri]], was able to establish himself in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], which he had regained by treaty in 1229, but not in Beirut or the capital in Acre.\n\nIn Acre, John's supporters formed a [[medieval commune|commune]], of which John himself was elected mayor when he arrived in 1232. The [[Commune of Acre]] was able to relieve the siege of Beirut, but in John's absence from Cyprus, the supporters of the Lusignans took control. In any case, the boy [[Henry I of Cyprus]] came of age in the same year, and John's regency was no longer necessary. When Henry I succeeded to the throne, both John and Riccardo immediately raced back to Cyprus, where the imperial forces were defeated in battle on June 15.  Henry became undisputed king of Cyprus, and since he supported the Ibelins over the Lusignans, John's family remained influential.\n\nConflict continued, as Filangieri remained in control of Jerusalem and Tyre, and had the support of [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]], the [[Teutonic Knights]], the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and the [[Pisa]]n merchants.  John, for his part, was supported by his nobles on Cyprus, and in his continental holdings in Beirut, [[Caesarea]], and [[Arsuf]], as well as by the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant community. Neither side could make any headway, and in 1234 [[Pope Gregory IX]] [[excommunicated]] John and his supporters. This was partly revoked in 1235, but still no peace could be made.\n\nIn the last year of his life, John of Ibelin, as did many other elderly barons, joined the order of the [[Knights Templar]], so that he could die as a Templar.  His family was opposed to this, but John insisted, and was honored with a grand funeral in [[Acre (city)|Acre]] in 1236.<ref>[[Malcolm Barber]], ''The New Knighthood''</ref>\n\n==Family==\nJohn was married twice.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1973|p=22}} His first wife, in 1201/1202, was Helvis of Nephin.

By 1198 he had become [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]]; the fact that he was the half-brother of [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem]] gave him considerable influence. At the time he was a vassal of [[Ralph of Tiberias]], who was exiled from the kingdom after being accused of attempting to assassinate king [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric II]]. John attempted to mediate but Amalric would not back down.\n\n==Lord of Beirut==\nSometime before 1205 John relinquished the office of constable in exchange for the lordship of [[Beirut]], which became the home of the Ibelin family for the rest of the century. He rebuilt the city, which had been completely destroyed during [[Saladin]]'s conquest of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem kingdom]]. He also constructed an opulent palace with art from both Muslim and Byzantine influences.  A German ambassador in 1212, Wilbrand of Oldenburg, wrote an impressive account of the castle, describing [[fresco]] paintings, mosaics on the floors, and a marble fountain in the courtyard.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Crusades|author=Kenneth Setton|pages=142&ndash;143|year=1985|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09144-6| quote=The Ibelin palace of Beirut, which took away the breath of a German ambassador to the east, shows Moslem and Byzantine influences.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Crusader Art in the Holy Land|author=Folda, Jaroslav|isbn=978-0-521-83583-1 |year=2005 | publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> Historian Peter Edbury described the ambassador's account as \"A feature of the public rooms were the ''[[Trompe-l'oeil]]'' effects achieved with marble inlays, with a floor resembling the sea and a ceiling 'painted with such life-like colours that clouds pass across, the west wind blows, and there the sun seems to mark out the year and the months, the days and the weeks, the hours and the moments by its movement in the zodiac'. A marble fountain with a dragon as the centre-piece stood in the central hall, its jets cooling the air and the murmur of the water giving an altogether soothing effect.\" The castle was so well fortified, that in 1231\u20131232, it withstood a siege lasting several months.<ref name=edbury-29>Edbury, p. 29</ref>\n\nBeirut was effectively an independent state under John's rule; in 1207 John added [[Arsuf]] to his territory through his marriage to [[Melisende of Arsuf]], making him one of the wealthiest nobles in the kingdom.<ref name=edbury-29/>\n\n==Regent==\n\nFrom 1205 to 1210 John served as [[regent]] in [[Akko|Acre]], the new capital of the [[kingdom of Jerusalem#Disaster and recovery|Kingdom of Jerusalem]], for [[Maria of Montferrat]], Queen Isabella I's daughter. As regent, John helped arrange the marriage of Amalric II's son [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] to [[Alice of Cyprus|Alice of Champagne]], daughter of Amalric's predecessor as [[King of Jerusalem]], [[Henry II of Champagne]]. In 1210 he also helped arrange Maria of Montferrat's marriage to [[John of Brienne]], who was suggested by king [[Philip II of France]].\n\nBy 1217 John and his brother Philip of Ibelin had become involved in the politics of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] as well. They had apparently alienated themselves from John of Brienne, but the two represented Cyprus at a council in Acre, which met to plan for the arrival of the [[Fifth Crusade]].  When Hugh I died in 1218, Philip became regent for Hugh's son [[Henry I of Cyprus]], Philip's nephew.  When Philip died in 1228, John took over the same office.  Although both Philip and John were closely related to Henry I, as his uncles, they were still opposed on Cyprus by supporters of the [[Lusignan]] family, of which Henry was also a member; another of his uncles, [[Guy of Lusignan]], and father Amalric, were the first two kings of Cyprus.\n\n==Battle for Cyprus==\n{{see also|War of the Lombards}}\nIn 1228, the power struggle was amplified when [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] arrived in Cyprus on the [[Sixth Crusade]]. Frederick was connected to the Jerusalem nobles by being married to [[Yolande of Jerusalem|Isabella II]], John of Brienne's daughter, and Frederick attempted to use this to take power.  He claimed the kingship of Jerusalem and the overlordship of Cyprus, as well as John of Ibelin's lordship of Beirut, which John naturally refused. When lured to a banquet and then confronted with Frederick's armed guards, John was forced to hand over the regency, and Cyprus, to Emperor Frederick's control. However, this was temporary, as John later resisted with military force.  After Frederick departed from the island in April, John's forces defeated the remaining imperial bailiffs in a battle outside [[Nicosia]] on July 14, 1229, thus beginning the [[War of the Lombards]]. Frederick sent an army in 1231, under the marshal of the Empire, which attempted to invade Cyprus. John was able to repel the invasion at the [[Battle of Agridi]], but the imperial fleet sailed to John's power center of Beirut, which they besieged and almost captured. The imperial marshal, [[Richard Filangieri]], was able to establish himself in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], which he had regained by treaty in 1229, but not in Beirut or the capital in Acre.\n\nIn Acre, John's supporters formed a [[medieval commune|commune]], of which John himself was elected mayor when he arrived in 1232. The [[Commune of Acre]] was able to relieve the siege of Beirut, but in John's absence from Cyprus, the supporters of the Lusignans took control. In any case, the boy [[Henry I of Cyprus]] came of age in the same year, and John's regency was no longer necessary. When Henry I succeeded to the throne, both John and Riccardo immediately raced back to Cyprus, where the imperial forces were defeated in battle on June 15.  Henry became undisputed king of Cyprus, and since he supported the Ibelins over the Lusignans, John's family remained influential.\n\nConflict continued, as Filangieri remained in control of Jerusalem and Tyre, and had the support of [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]], the [[Teutonic Knights]], the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and the [[Pisa]]n merchants.  John, for his part, was supported by his nobles on Cyprus, and in his continental holdings in Beirut, [[Caesarea]], and [[Arsuf]], as well as by the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant community. Neither side could make any headway, and in 1234 [[Pope Gregory IX]] [[excommunicated]] John and his supporters. This was partly revoked in 1235, but still no peace could be made.\n\nIn the last year of his life, John of Ibelin, as did many other elderly barons, joined the order of the [[Knights Templar]], so that he could die as a Templar.  His family was opposed to this, but John insisted, and was honored with a grand funeral in [[Acre (city)|Acre]] in 1236.<ref>[[Malcolm Barber]], ''The New Knighthood''</ref>\n\n==Family==\nJohn was married twice.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1973|p=22}} His first wife, in 1201/1202, was Helvis of Nephin.
