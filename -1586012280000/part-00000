He wrote it after appearing in, and being moved by, an earlier play about [[World War I]], ''[[Journey's End]]'' by [[R. C. Sherriff]]. As soon as he had completed writing it, however, he decided that it was suitable for publication but not for production.\n\nThe play was first staged in a [[prisoner of war]] camp in Austria in 1944. In 1966, the first full public performance was mounted by [[Lord Williams's School|Lord Williams's Grammar School]], [[Thame]]. A television version was broadcast in 1968. The play was not professionally presented on stage until 1992, two decades after Coward's death. Critical opinion has generally agreed with Coward about the effectiveness of the play onstage, although it includes some techniques that Coward used elsewhere with greater success.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1930, Coward briefly played the role of Stanhope in [[R. C. Sherriff]]'s play ''[[Journey's End]]'', set in the trenches of [[World War I]]. He did not consider his performance successful, writing afterwards that his audience \"politely watched me take a fine part in a fine play and throw it into the alley.\"<ref>Coward, ''Present Indicative'', p. 304.</ref> However, he was \"strongly affected by the poignancy of the play itself\" and wrote his own \"angry little vilification of war\" shortly afterwards.<ref name=lesley>Lesley, p. 140.</ref> As soon as it was written, he decided that it was for publication only and should not be staged,<ref name=lesley/> and he published it in 1931.<ref name=times31>Display advertisement for ''Post-Mortem'', ''[[The Times]]'', 8 May 1931, p. 22.</ref> The press commented on the absence of a production: \"Mr Noel Coward, riding on the crest of such a wave of success that it might have been imagined that his least work would be bargained for, published last year a serious play, ''Post-Mortem'', that, so far as we know, no manager made the smallest attempt to produce.\"<ref>\"Dramatis Personae\", ''[[The Observer]]'', 11 September 1932, p. 13.</ref>\n\nWhen the first volume of Coward's collected plays was published in 1934, he wrote an introduction commenting on the various plays. Reviewing the volume, the critic [[St. John Ervine]] wrote of ''Post-Mortem'', \"Mr. Coward's considered judgment on it is sound, and a sign of his rapidly maturing talent. He now regards it as 'sadly confused and unbalanced'.\"<ref>Ervine, St. John. \"At the Play \u2013 Mr. Sherriff and Some Others\", ''The Observer'', 11 November 1934, p. 17.</ref> Reviewing the same volume, [[James Agate]] praised Coward's seriousness and reproached avant garde theatres for failing to stage the play.<ref>Agate, James. \"How Good is Noel Coward?\", ''[[The Daily Express]]'', 11 October 1934, p. 8.</ref> In 1935 a production was planned at a small provincial theatre with a reputation for staging new works, but the plans were not realised.<ref>\"Miscellany\", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 December 1935, p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe play foreshadows Coward's treatment of the theme of ghosts in his 1940 play, ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]''. The middle scenes of ''Post-Mortem'' portray John as a ghost whom everyone can see, but about whose nature the other characters are apparently not greatly concerned. In the later play, there are two ghosts, which some characters can see and others cannot.<ref>''Blithe Spirit'', Act I, scene II and Act III, scene II and ''passim''</ref> The last scene uses the same technique as [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s \"[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]\", where, at the end, it is revealed that most of the story occurred only within the protagonist's mind.<ref>Bierce, Ambrose.

In the trenches, John argues with another soldier, Perry Lomas, over the war; Perry accuses John's father of glorifying war in his newspaper, but John denies this. At the end of the scene, John is mortally wounded by enemy fire. He is dragged back to the trench, where as he lies dying he imagines the reaction of the people he knows best to the end of the war.\n\nThe next six scenes take place in England in 1930. John, now a ghost dressed in the muddy uniform he died in, encounters family, friends, and those of his wartime comrades who have survived. He finds out what the war, ended more than ten years past, has meant to them \u2013 not much, it turns out. Perry had survived the war and has written a book, ''Post-Mortem'', exposing the truth about the horrible treatment of British soldiers returned from \"The Great War\". John's mother is afraid of the book, John's father wants the book banned, and John's girlfriend treats it as a rare collector's item to be prized for its monetary worth. Perry, after a spirited monologue laying out the miserable aftermath of war, shoots himself in the head in despair.\n\nIn the last scene, back in 1917 in the trenches in France, John dies, receding into shadow, lamenting the futility of his generation's sacrifice.\n\n== Productions ==\n''Post-Mortem'' was published in 1931, but was not staged until 1944. Its premi\u00e8re was a production by British prisoners of war in a German camp, during [[World War II]], at [[Eichst\u00e4tt]]. The four leading parts were performed by professional actors, [[Michael Goodliffe]], Dan Cunningham, Brian McIrvine and [[Desmond Llewelyn]], and the play was produced and directed by a fifth professional actor and producer, Wallace Finlayson.

What disfigures the play is not Coward's thumping message but the mechanical nature of Cavan's civilian Cook's tour and the easy caricature of soft targets: philandering press-magnates, pleasure-seeking bishops and purblind Lady Bountifuls.

Coward's hatred of this brittle, blas\u00e9 age, which does not want to understand the horrors of the first world war, is not so surprising as his perception that the second is already in the making: someone actually remarks that the next Olympic games (1932) could be a preparation for it. I never imagined that the Master, at 31, was so politically switched on.

Meanwhile, Abdur Rahman Khan conquered the [[Nuristanis]] and made them Muslims. Concurrently, Afridi tribesmen began rising up in arms against the British, creating a zone of instability between Peshawar and the Durand Line. Further, frequent skirmishes and wars between the Afghan state and the [[British Raj]] starting in the 1870s made travel between [[Peshawar]] and [[Jalalabad]] almost impossible. As a result, travel across the boundary was almost entirely halted. Further, the British recruited tens of thousands of local Pashtuns into the [[British Indian Army]] and stationed them throughout British India and southeast Asia. Exposure to India, combined with the ease of travel eastwards into [[Punjab]] and the difficulty of travel towards Afghanistan, led many Pashtuns to orient themselves towards the heartlands of [[British India]] and away from Kabul.

Meanwhile, Abdur Rahman Khan conquered the [[Nuristanis]] and made them Muslims. Concurrently, Afridi tribesmen began rising up in arms against the British, creating a zone of instability between Peshawar and the Durand Line. Further, frequent skirmishes and wars between the Afghan state and the [[British Raj]] starting in the 1870s made travel between [[Peshawar]] and [[Jalalabad]] almost impossible. As a result, travel across the boundary was almost entirely halted. Further, the British recruited tens of thousands of local Pashtuns into the [[British Indian Army]] and stationed them throughout British India and southeast Asia. Exposure to India, combined with the ease of travel eastwards into [[Punjab]] and the difficulty of travel towards Afghanistan, led many Pashtuns to orient themselves towards the heartlands of [[British India]] and away from Kabul.
