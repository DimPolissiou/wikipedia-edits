He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at the [[University of Cambridge]], and became president of the [[Footlights]], touring internationally with its revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and was a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for almost 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read economics and politics before changing to read law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and  transferred to the [[West End of London|West End]] in London before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> Brooke-Taylor was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.

Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in [[David Frost]]'s pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/tag/John-Cleese|title=Tags: John Cleese &#124; Dangerous Minds|website=dangerousminds.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063100/fullcredits|title=\"David Frost Presents\" How to Irritate People (TV Episode 1969) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sotcaa.org/history/ukonline/python_frame.html?/history/ukonline/python/python_irritate.html|title=Some Of The Corpses Are Amusing|website=sotcaa.org}}</ref> Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nAlso in 1968 Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369 Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''.

Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]].

The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\".<ref name=BBCDeath/> Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ldEQYB39GSsC|title=The Fully Authorised History of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue: The Clue Bible from Footlights to Mornington Crescent|first=Jem|last=Roberts|date=2 September 2010|publisher=Random House|via=Google Books}}</ref> On 18 February 1981, Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nIn 1998 Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode of the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143043/fullcredits|title=If I Ruled the World (TV Series 1998\u2013 ) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]]. [[Paul McGann]] played the [[Eighth Doctor]], and Brooke-Taylor played the part of Mims, a [[Zygon]] taking the shape of a human.\n\nBrooke-Taylor was the voice of the narrator on the children's cartoon series ''[[Bananaman (TV series)|Bananaman.]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they had two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>''Who's Who on Television'' \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in [[Berkshire]].<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref>  He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 Today \u2013 Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom]], Brooke-Taylor died of complications from [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on 12 April 2020, aged 79.<ref name=BBCDeath>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews ===\nBrooke-Taylor was elected Lord [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Rector]] by the students of the [[University of St Andrews]] and held office between 1979 and 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/rectorelection/previousrectors/|title=Previous Rectors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>  In this role he represented the students, chaired the University Court and presided over the [[General Council of the University of St Andrews|General Council]] in the absence of the [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|Chancellor]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/rectorelection/history/|title=History of the Rector|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/key-officials/rector/|title=Rector|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\u00a0 At his installation he arrived by helicopter, rode a motorbike and was hauled in an open carriage as part of The Drag.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://standrewsrarebooks.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/cricketer-comedians-and-campaigners-rectors-1967-93/|title=Cricketer, Comedians, and Campaigners: Rectors, 1967-1993|last=St Andrews Special Collections|date=2018-04-13|website=Echoes from the Vault|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> His installation speech included a mother-in-law joke in Latin and a suggestion his successor should be a woman;

All the trains on the NSL runs with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the East West line. In the 1990s, the line extends to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line includes a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and set to open in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nAfter the decision to build a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore, the construction of what would become the North South Line was given priority as the line passed through the [[Orchard Road]] corridor as well as the rest of the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], the latter of which faced a high demand for public transport.

Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5.30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL runs with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the East West line. In the 1990s, the line extends to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity.
