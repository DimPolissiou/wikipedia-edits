He was a high-ranking [[Song dynasty]] [[scholar-official]] and historian who authored the monumental history book ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''. Sima was a political conservative who opposed [[Wang Anshi]]'s reforms.\n\n==Early life==\nSima Guang was named after his birthplace [[Gu\u0101ng Prefecture]], where his father Sima Chi (\u53f8\u99ac\u6c60) served as a [[county magistrate]] in [[Guangshan County]]. The Simas were originally from [[Xia County]] in [[Sh\u01cen Prefecture]], and claimed descent from [[Sima Fu]] in the 3rd century. A famous anecdote relates how the young Sima Guang once saved a playmate who had fallen into an enormous vat full of water. As other children scattered in panic, Sima Guang calmly picked up a rock and smashed a hole in the base of the pot. Water leaked out, and his friend was saved from drowning.<ref name=ss336>{{harvnb|''Song Shi''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/\u5b8b\u53f2/\u5377336 ch. 336.]}}</ref>\n\nAt age 6, Sima Guang once heard a lecture on the 4th-century BC history book ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''. Fascinated, he was able to retell the stories to his family when he returned home. He became an avid reader, \"to the point of not recognizing hunger, thirst, coldness or heat\".<ref name=ss336/>\n\nSima Guang obtained early success as a scholar and officer. When he was barely twenty, he passed the [[Imperial examination]] with the highest rank of ''j\u00ecnsh\u00ec'' (\u9032\u58eb \"metropolitan graduate\"), and spent the next several years in official positions.\n\n==Professional life==\nSima Guang is best remembered for his masterwork, [[Zizhi Tongjian|''Zizhi Tongjian'',]] and the Australian sinologist [[Rafe de Crespigny]]  describes him as \"perhaps the greatest of all Chinese historians\"  {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1973|p=65}}.\n\nIn 1064, Sima presented to [[Emperor Yingzong of Song]] the five-volume ([[Wikt:\u5377|\u5377]]) ''Liniantu'' (\u6b77\u5e74\u5716 \"Chart of Successive Years\"). It chronologically summarized events in [[Chinese history]] from 403 BCE to 959 CE, and served as a prospectus for sponsorship of his ambitious project in [[historiography]]. These dates were chosen because 403 BCE was the beginning of the [[Warring States]] period, when the ancient [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] was subdivided, which eventually led to the establishment of the [[Qin Dynasty]]; and because 959 CE was the end of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] and the beginning of the Song Dynasty.\n[[File:China, Jiangxi province, Jingdezhen, Qing dynasty, Shunzhi period - Brush Pot with Episode from Life on Sima Guang - 1964.179 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|thumb|Brush pot with the pot-breaking episode from the story of Sima Guang, [[Transitional porcelain]].]]\n\nIn 1066, he presented a more detailed eight-volume ''Tongzhi'' (\u901a\u5fd7; \"Comprehensive Records\"), which chronicled Chinese history from 403 BCE to 207 BCE (the end of the Qin Dynasty). The emperor issued an edict for the compilation of a groundbreaking [[universal history]] of China, granting full access to imperial libraries, and allocating funds for the costs of compilation, including research assistance by experienced historians such as Liu Ban (\u5289\u653d, 1022\u201388), Liu Shu (\u5289\u6055, 1032-78), and Fan Zuyu (\u8303\u7956\u79b9, 1041\u201398). After Yingzong died in 1067, Sima was invited to the palace to introduce his work-in-progress to [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]]. The new emperor not only confirmed the interest his father had shown, but showed his favor by bestowing an imperial preface in which he changed the title from ''Tongzhi'' (\"Comprehensive Records\") to ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' (\"Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government\"). Scholars interpret the \"Mirror\" of the title to denote a work of reference and guidance, indicating that Shenzong accepted Sima as his guide in the study of history and its application to government. The emperor maintained his support for the compilation of this comprehensive history until its completion in 1084.\n\nFrom the late 1060s, Sima came to assume a role as leader of what has been identified as a conservative faction at court, resolutely opposed to the [[New Policies (Song dynasty)|New Policies]] of Chancellor [[Wang Anshi]]. Sima presented increasingly critical [[memorials to the throne]] until 1070, when he refused further appointment and withdrew from court. In 1071, he took up residence in [[Luoyang]], where he remained with an official sinecure, providing sufficient time and resources to continue the compilation of [[Zizhi Tongjian]]. Though the historian and the emperor continued to disagree on policies, Sima's enforced retirement proved essential for him to complete his chronological history over the following one and a half decades. Contemporary accounts relate that to work more and sleep less when he was writing his great opus, the Zizhi Tongjian, he had a wooden pillow made from a log, designed to slip from under his head whenever he rolled over. He called this Jingzhen \u8b66\u6795 (Alert Pillow), and used it throughout the period of [[Zizhi Tongjian]]'s compilation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sima Guang and His History Book |url=http://people.chinesecio.com/en/article/2009-12/11/content_91256.htm |accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nEmperor Shenzong died in 1085, shortly after Sima had submitted ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' to the throne. Sima was recalled to court and appointed to lead the government under [[Emperor Zhezong of Song]]. He used this time in power to repeal many of the [[New Policies (Song dynasty)|New Policies]], but he died the following year, in 1086.\n\n==Achievement==\nAs well as his achievements as a statesman and historian, Sima Guang was also a [[lexicographer]] (who perhaps edited the ''[[Jiyun]]''), and spent decades compiling his 1066 ''[[Leipian]]'' (\"Classified Chapters\", cf. the [[Yupian]]) dictionary. It was based on the [[Shuowen Jiezi]], and included 31,319 [[Chinese characters]], many of which were coined in the Song and [[Tang Dynasty]].

Elias Merhige]], written by [[Steven A. Katz|Steven Katz]], and starring [[John Malkovich]] and [[Willem Dafoe]]. The film is a fictionalized documentary account of the making of the classic [[vampire]] film ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens]]'', directed by [[F. W. Murnau]], during which the film crew began to have disturbing suspicions about their lead actor.\n\nThe film borrows the techniques of [[silent film]]s, including the use of [[intertitle]]s to explain [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|elided]] action, and [[Iris shot|iris lenses]]. The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]]. For his performance, Dafoe was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35161/dread-centrals-best-horror-films-decade Dread Central's Best Horror Films of the Decade]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1921, German director [[F. W. Murnau]] takes his cast and crew on-location in [[Czechoslovakia]] to shoot ''[[Nosferatu]]'', an unauthorized version of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]''. Murnau keeps his team in the dark about their schedule and the actor playing the [[vampire]] [[Count Orlok]]. It is left to the film's other main actor, [[Gustav von Wangenheim]], to explain that the lead is an obscure [[German people|German]] theater performer named [[Max Schreck]], who is a [[character actor]]. To involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear amongst the cast and crew in makeup, will only ever be filmed at night, and will never break character. \n\nAfter filming scenes in a studio with leading actress [[Greta Schr\u00f6der]], who is displeased about leaving Berlin, Murnau's team travels to the remote inn where they will be staying and shooting further scenes. The landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller, falls into a strange, hypnotic state. Gustav discovers a bottle of blood amongst the team's food supplies, and Murnau delivers a caged ferret in the middle of the night to a not yet fully revealed Shreck. \n\nOne night, Murnau rushes his team up to an old [[Slovakia|Slovak]] castle for the first scene with the vampire. Schreck appears for the first time, and his appearance and behavior impress and disturb them. The film's producer, [[Albin Grau]], suspects that Schreck is not a German theater actor, and is confused when Murnau tells him that he originally found Schreck in the castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolfgang is found collapsed in the tunnel into which Schreck had receded. Upon returning to the inn, the landlady appears frightened by his pale, weak appearance and mutters \"Nosferatu\" while clutching at a [[rosary]].\n\nWhilst filming a dinner scene between Gustav and Count Orlok, Murnau startles Gustav, making him cut his finger. Schreck reacts wildly at the sight of the blood and tries drinking from Gustav's wound. The [[Electric generator|generator]] powering the lights fails and when the lights return, Schreck has pinned Wolfgang to the floor, apparently draining his blood. Albin orders filming ended for the night, and the crew rushes from the castle, leaving Schreck behind. Alone, Schreck examines the camera equipment, fascinated by footage of a sunrise.\n\nWith Wolfgang near death, Murnau is forced to bring in another cinematographer, [[Fritz Arno Wagner]], after chastising Schreck in private for attacking his crew members and threatening him with harm if he does not control himself in Murnau's absence -- a threat that Schreck challenges due to his immortality. During Murnau's absence in Berlin to calm financiers of the film, Schreck approaches Albin and the screenwriter, [[Henrik Galeen]]. They invite Schreck to join them, believing he is still in character, and ask him a vampire's opinion of [[Dracula]]. Schreck points out Dracula's loneliness and the sadness of Dracula trying to remember how to do otherwise mundane chores (such as setting a table to entertain [[Jonathan Harker]]) that he has not needed to perform for centuries. When they ask how he became a vampire, Schreck says it was a woman. A bat flies by and Schreck catches it, viciously sucking its blood. Grau and Galeen, thanks to their drunkenness on schnapps, are impressed by what they assume is talented acting. Later that night, Schreck disregards Murnau's threat and attacks a crew member in the boat replica, feeding on him and tossing his lifeless body from the deck to the grounds below.\n\nThe production moves to [[Heligoland]] to film the final scenes, and Murnau, in a laudanum-induced stupor, admits Schreck's true nature to Albin and Fritz: Schreck is in fact an actual vampire, and Murnau has struck a deal with him in order to create the most realistic vampire film possible. In return for his cooperation, Murnau has promised him Greta as a reward. The two realize they are trapped on the island, leaving no choice but to complete the film and give Greta to the vampire if they wish to survive.\n\nJust as they are about to begin filming their scene together, Greta becomes hysterical after noticing Schreck casts no reflection. Murnau, Albin and Fritz drug her with Murnau's laudanum, and film as Schreck feeds on a now comatose Greta, with the laudanum in her blood putting Schreck to sleep. At dawn, the three attempt to open a door and let in sunlight to destroy Schreck, but discover that the vampire, suspecting their treachery, had cut the chain to the mechanism, trapping them in the process. Fritz and Albin each try other means of killing Schreck, using a pistol and prop stake respectively, only to be killed by the vampire. Murnau, meanwhile, resumes filming, and, seemingly crazed, completely ignores the deaths of his colleagues and the glare of malicious intent Schreck is giving him. Instead, he instructs Schreck to return to his mark for another take. Schreck is perplexed by Murnau's disregard for the threat, and is told \"If it's not in frame, it doesn't exist\". Schreck obliges the request, returning to Greta and feeding on her again, finally finishing her off as Murnau resumes filming. During this second take, Galeen and the crew arrive and lift the door, flooding the set with sunlight and destroying Schreck. The crew sees how insane and obsessed Murnau's become, and he stops filming before calmly states, \"I think we have it.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[F. W.

Fritz Wagner and Albin Grau, who are shown having their necks snapped by Count Orlok, lived to the 1950s and 1970s respectively. Greta Schroeder, who also did not actually die, continued to have a film career until the 1950s and died in 1980. She is also depicted as being a famous actress, but in fact, she was little known, and by the 1930s her roles had diminished to only occasional appearances. Of all the characters, Murnau died the soonest after the production of ''Nosferatu'', killed in a car crash in California in 1931. The film's depiction of Murnau as ruthless and dictatorial is also wrong. He was known as a director with rare sensitivity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Atkinson |first1=Michael |title=The truth about film-maker FW Murnau |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jan/26/culture.features2 |website=The Guardian |accessdate=21 February 2019 |date=26 January 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=May 2015}}\nThe film's working title was ''Burned to Light'', but Merhige decided to change the name of the film when Dafoe asked, \"Who's Ed?\"; the actor thought the title was ''Burn Ed to Light''.<ref>Bonus features on ''Shadow of the Vampire'' DVD - Interview with [[E.

Elias Merhige]], written by [[Steven A. Katz|Steven Katz]], and starring [[John Malkovich]] and [[Willem Dafoe]]. The film is a fictionalized documentary account of the making of the classic [[vampire]] film ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens]]'', directed by [[F. W. Murnau]], during which the film crew began to have disturbing suspicions about their lead actor.\n\nThe film borrows the techniques of [[silent film]]s, including the use of [[intertitle]]s to explain [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|elided]] action, and [[Iris shot|iris lenses]]. The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]]. For his performance, Dafoe was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35161/dread-centrals-best-horror-films-decade Dread Central's Best Horror Films of the Decade]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1921, German director [[F. W. Murnau]] takes his cast and crew on-location in [[Czechoslovakia]] to shoot ''[[Nosferatu]]'', an unauthorized version of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]''. Murnau keeps his team in the dark about their schedule and the actor playing the [[vampire]] [[Count Orlok]]. It is left to the film's other main actor, [[Gustav von Wangenheim]], to explain that the lead is an obscure [[German people|German]] theater performer named [[Max Schreck]], who is a [[character actor]]. To involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear amongst the cast and crew in makeup, will only ever be filmed at night, and will never break character. \n\nAfter filming scenes in a studio with leading actress [[Greta Schr\u00f6der]], who is displeased about leaving Berlin, Murnau's team travels to the remote inn where they will be staying and shooting further scenes. The landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller, falls into a strange, hypnotic state. Gustav discovers a bottle of blood amongst the team's food supplies, and Murnau delivers a caged ferret in the middle of the night to a not yet fully revealed Shreck. \n\nOne night, Murnau rushes his team up to an old [[Slovakia|Slovak]] castle for the first scene with the vampire. Schreck appears for the first time, and his appearance and behavior impress and disturb them. The film's producer, [[Albin Grau]], suspects that Schreck is not a German theater actor, and is confused when Murnau tells him that he originally found Schreck in the castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolfgang is found collapsed in the tunnel into which Schreck had receded. Upon returning to the inn, the landlady appears frightened by his pale, weak appearance and mutters \"Nosferatu\" while clutching at a [[rosary]].\n\nWhilst filming a dinner scene between Gustav and Count Orlok, Murnau startles Gustav, making him cut his finger. Schreck reacts wildly at the sight of the blood and tries drinking from Gustav's wound. The [[Electric generator|generator]] powering the lights fails and when the lights return, Schreck has pinned Wolfgang to the floor, apparently draining his blood. Albin orders filming ended for the night, and the crew rushes from the castle, leaving Schreck behind. Alone, Schreck examines the camera equipment, fascinated by footage of a sunrise.\n\nWith Wolfgang near death, Murnau is forced to bring in another cinematographer, [[Fritz Arno Wagner]], after chastising Schreck in private for attacking his crew members and threatening him with harm if he does not control himself in Murnau's absence -- a threat that Schreck challenges due to his immortality. During Murnau's absence in Berlin to calm financiers of the film, Schreck approaches Albin and the screenwriter, [[Henrik Galeen]]. They invite Schreck to join them, believing he is still in character, and ask him a vampire's opinion of [[Dracula]]. Schreck points out Dracula's loneliness and the sadness of Dracula trying to remember how to do otherwise mundane chores (such as setting a table to entertain [[Jonathan Harker]]) that he has not needed to perform for centuries. When they ask how he became a vampire, Schreck says it was a woman. A bat flies by and Schreck catches it, viciously sucking its blood. Grau and Galeen, thanks to their drunkenness on schnapps, are impressed by what they assume is talented acting. Later that night, Schreck disregards Murnau's threat and attacks a crew member in the boat replica, feeding on him and tossing his lifeless body from the deck to the grounds below.\n\nThe production moves to [[Heligoland]] to film the final scenes, and Murnau, in a laudanum-induced stupor, admits Schreck's true nature to Albin and Fritz: Schreck is in fact an actual vampire, and Murnau has struck a deal with him in order to create the most realistic vampire film possible. In return for his cooperation, Murnau has promised him Greta as a reward. The two realize they are trapped on the island, leaving no choice but to complete the film and give Greta to the vampire if they wish to survive.\n\nJust as they are about to begin filming their scene together, Greta becomes hysterical after noticing Schreck casts no reflection. Murnau, Albin and Fritz drug her with Murnau's laudanum, and film as Schreck feeds on a now comatose Greta, with the laudanum in her blood putting Schreck to sleep. At dawn, the three attempt to open a door and let in sunlight to destroy Schreck, but discover that the vampire, suspecting their treachery, had cut the chain to the mechanism, trapping them in the process.

Instead, he instructs Schreck to return to his mark for another take. Schreck is perplexed by Murnau's disregard for the threat, and is told \"If it's not in frame, it doesn't exist\". Schreck obliges the request, returning to Greta and feeding on her again, finally finishing her off as Murnau resumes filming. During this second take, Galeen and the crew arrive and lift the door, flooding the set with sunlight and destroying Schreck. The crew sees how insane and obsessed Murnau's become, and he stops filming before calmly states, \"I think we have it.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[F. W.
