''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nDespite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Customs ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masai Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morvi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Family arrangements ===\nMembers of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2\u20133, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nMarried couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Bharwads practice \"sartorial conservatism\", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&nbsp;\u2014 in terms of style, colour and material&nbsp;\u2014 have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}\n\nThe clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&nbsp;\u2014 as late as the early 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nThere also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dhangar]]\n* [[Rabari]]\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n\n'''Citations'''\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n[[Category:Tribal communities of Gujarat]]\n[[Category:Maldhari communities]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Kutch]]\n[[Category:Herding castes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hindu caste found in the state of Gujarat in India}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Member of the Bharwad community of India.jpg|thumb|Member of the Bharwad community of India]]\nThe '''Bharwad''' are a [[Hindu]] [[Adivasi]] [[caste]] found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in India.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1nVCAAAAYAAJ&q=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A1+%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF&dq=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A1+%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF | title=Vanyaj\u0101ti, \u092d\u093e\u0917 16,\u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e 2 | year=1968 | publisher=Bharatiya Adimjati Sevak Sangh., 1968| accessdate=23 Apr 2009| page=79}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Bharwad name may derive from the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] word ''bharawad'', constructed from ''bhara'' (sheep) and ''wad'' (a compound or enclosure).

These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]]. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===\nThe [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ |date=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===MINIX===\nIn 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MINi-unIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]</ref> The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the \"Who wrote Linux\" Kerfuffle]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818183310/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ |date=August 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf |title=USENIX April 06 |access-date=2007-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807222457/http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf |archive-date=2007-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ |title=Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit |access-date=2009-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111055829/http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ |archive-date=2010-01-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.\n\n===Research projects===\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]]. These projects include:\n* [[Amoeba distributed operating system|Amoeba]]<ref>{{Cite journal\n |last1        = Tanenbaum\n |first1       = A.

He stated that he created the site as an American who \"knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.\"<ref name=\"EVFAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html |title=The Votemaster FAQ |accessdate=2017-02-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102014915/http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html |archivedate=November 2, 2004 }}</ref> The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as \"the Votemaster\" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred [[John Kerry]]. Mentioning that he supported the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day before the election, and also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.<ref name=\"EVFAQ\" />\n\nThrough the site he also covered the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.\n\nFor the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 elections]], he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].\n\nElectoral-vote.com incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton would win the [[2016 United States presidential election]].  The website incorrectly predicted Clinton would win Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida.  Electoral-vote.com did not predict a winner for Nevada, which Clinton would win.  The website predicted the winners of the remaining 44 states and the District of Columbia correctly.<ref>https://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2016/Pres/Maps/Nov08.html</ref>\n\n==Tanenbaum\u2013Torvalds debate==\nThe [[Tanenbaum\u2013Torvalds debate]] was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on [[Usenet]] in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI%5B1-25-false%5D |title=\"LINUX is obsolete\" Usenet Debate Text |access-date=2014-07-19 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121219010015/https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups%3D#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI%5B1-25-false%5D |archive-date=2012-12-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n* Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]\n* Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1994)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4853 |title=Andrew Tanenbaum |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=17 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721044135/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4853 |archive-date=2015-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Eurosys Lifetime Achievement Award, 2015\n* Honorary doctorate from Petru Maior University, Targu Mures, Romania, 2011\n* Winner of the TAA [[William Holmes McGuffey#McGuffey Awards|McGuffey award]] for classic textbooks for Modern Operating Systems, 2010\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the LADC Conference, 2009\n* Winner of a 2.5 million euro [[European Research Council]] Advanced Grant, 2008\n* [[USENIX]] Flame Award 2008 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/about/flame.html# |title=USENIX Flame Award |access-date=2008-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006152610/https://www.usenix.org/about/flame |archive-date=2012-10-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> for his many contributions to systems design and to openness both in discussion and in source\n* Honorary doctorate from Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Romania\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the Real-Time and Network Systems Conf., 2008\n* Winner of the 2007 [[IEEE James H.

The award was given in the academic senate chamber, after which Tanenbaum gave a lecture on his vision of the future of the computer field. The degree was given in recognition of Tanenbaum's career work, which includes about 150 published papers, 18 books (which have been translated into over 20 languages), and the creation of a large body of open-source software, including the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX.\n* On October 7, 2011, Universitatea Petru Maior din T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 ([[Petru Maior University of T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]) granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa (honorary doctorate) title for his remarkable work in the field of computer science and achievements in education. The academic community is hereby honoring his devotion to teaching and research with this award. At the ceremony, the Chancellor, the Rector, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and others all spoke about Tanenbaum and his work. The pro-rector then read the 'laudatio,' summarizing Tanenbaum's achievements. These include his work developing MINIX (the predecessor to Linux), the RFID Guardian, his work on Globe, Amoeba, and other systems, and his many books on computer science, which have been translated in many languages, including Romanian, and which are used at Petru Maior University.\n\n==Keynote talks==\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n* [http://www.froscon.de/en/home FrOSCon 2015] Sankt Augustin, Germany, Aug. 22, 2015\n* [http://www.bsdcan.org BSDCan 2015] Ottawa, Canada, June 12, 2015\n* [http://www.haxpo.nl HAXPO 2015] Amsterdam May 28, 2015\n* [[Codemotion 2015]]  Rome Italy, March 28, 2015\n* [http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_889BS7 SIREN 2010]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Veldhoven, The Netherlands, Nov. 2, 2010\n* [[FOSDEM]] Brussels, Belgium, Feb 7, 2010\n* [http://neteng.nudt.edu.cn/NSCNE09/cfp2.html NSCNE '09]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Changsha, China, Nov. 5, 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924085448/http://www.e-democracy2009.gr/ E-Democracy 2009 Conference] Athens, Greece, Sept. 25, 2009\n* [http://www.froscon.org Free and Open Source Conference] Sankt Augustin, Germany, August 23, 2008\n* XV [http://www.sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/ Semana Inform\u00e1tica] of the [[Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico]], Lisbon, Portugal, March 13, 2008\n* [[NLUUG]] [https://www.nluug.nl/events/nj07/en/programma/tanenbaum.html 25 year anniversary] conference, Amsterdam, November 7, 2007\n* [[linux.conf.au]] in Sydney, Australia, January 17, 2007\n* Academic IT Festival in Cracow, Poland, February 23, 2006 (2nd edition)\n* [http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp05/default.htm ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles], Brighton, England, October 24, 2005\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Andrew S.

These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]]. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===\nThe [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ |date=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===MINIX===\nIn 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MINi-unIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]</ref> The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the \"Who wrote Linux\" Kerfuffle]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818183310/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ |date=August 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf |title=USENIX April 06 |access-date=2007-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807222457/http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf |archive-date=2007-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure operating system.

The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.\n\n===Research projects===\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]].

He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].\n\nElectoral-vote.com incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton would win the [[2016 United States presidential election]].  The website incorrectly predicted Clinton would win Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida.  Electoral-vote.com did not predict a winner for Nevada, which Clinton would win.

The award was given in the academic senate chamber, after which Tanenbaum gave a lecture on his vision of the future of the computer field. The degree was given in recognition of Tanenbaum's career work, which includes about 150 published papers, 18 books (which have been translated into over 20 languages), and the creation of a large body of open-source software, including the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX.\n* On October 7, 2011, Universitatea Petru Maior din T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 ([[Petru Maior University of T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]) granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa (honorary doctorate) title for his remarkable work in the field of computer science and achievements in education. The academic community is hereby honoring his devotion to teaching and research with this award. At the ceremony, the Chancellor, the Rector, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and others all spoke about Tanenbaum and his work. The pro-rector then read the 'laudatio,' summarizing Tanenbaum's achievements. These include his work developing MINIX (the predecessor to Linux), the RFID Guardian, his work on Globe, Amoeba, and other systems, and his many books on computer science, which have been translated in many languages, including Romanian, and which are used at Petru Maior University.\n\n==Keynote talks==\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n* [http://www.froscon.de/en/home FrOSCon 2015] Sankt Augustin, Germany, Aug. 22, 2015\n* [http://www.bsdcan.org BSDCan 2015] Ottawa, Canada, June 12, 2015\n* [http://www.haxpo.nl HAXPO 2015] Amsterdam May 28, 2015\n* [[Codemotion 2015]]  Rome Italy, March 28, 2015\n* [http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_889BS7 SIREN 2010]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Veldhoven, The Netherlands, Nov. 2, 2010\n* [[FOSDEM]] Brussels, Belgium, Feb 7, 2010\n* [http://neteng.nudt.edu.cn/NSCNE09/cfp2.html NSCNE '09]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Changsha, China, Nov. 5, 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924085448/http://www.e-democracy2009.gr/ E-Democracy 2009 Conference] Athens, Greece, Sept. 25, 2009\n* [http://www.froscon.org Free and Open Source Conference] Sankt Augustin, Germany, August 23, 2008\n* XV [http://www.sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/ Semana Inform\u00e1tica] of the [[Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico]], Lisbon, Portugal, March 13, 2008\n* [[NLUUG]] [https://www.nluug.nl/events/nj07/en/programma/tanenbaum.html 25 year anniversary] conference, Amsterdam, November 7, 2007\n* [[linux.conf.au]] in Sydney, Australia, January 17, 2007\n* Academic IT Festival in Cracow, Poland, February 23, 2006 (2nd edition)\n* [http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp05/default.htm ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles], Brighton, England, October 24, 2005\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Andrew S.

Its [[unit of measurement|unit]] is [[kilogram]] per [[second]] in [[SI]] units, and [[Slug (unit)|slug]] per second or [[pound (mass)|pound]] per second in [[US customary unit]]s.  The common symbol is <math>\\dot{m}</math> ('''\u1e41''', pronounced \"m-dot\"), although sometimes ''\u03bc'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] lowercase [[Mu (letter)|mu]]) is used.\n\nSometimes, mass flow rate is termed ''[[mass flux]]'' or ''mass current'', see for example ''Fluid Mechanics, Schaum's et al''.<ref>Fluid Mechanics, M. Potter, D.C. Wiggart, Schuam's outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-07-148781-8}}</ref> In this article, the (more intuitive) definition is used.\n\nMass flow rate is defined by the [[limit of a function|limit]]:<ref>http://www.engineersedge.com/fluid_flow/mass_flow_rate.htm</ref><ref>http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/mflow.html</ref>\n\n:<math>\\dot{m} = \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Delta m}{ \\Delta t}= \\frac{{\\rm d}m}{{\\rm d}t}</math>\n\ni.e. the flow of mass ''m'' through a surface per unit time ''t''.\n\nThe overdot on the ''m'' is [[Newton's notation]] for a [[time derivative]]. Since mass is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, the mass flow rate (the time derivative of mass) is also a scalar quantity. The change in mass is the amount that flows ''after'' crossing the boundary for some time duration, not the initial amount of mass at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in mass flowing through the area would be zero for [[steady flow]].\n\n==Alternative equations==\n\nMass flow rate can also be calculated by:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho \\cdot \\dot V = \\rho \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere:\n*''<math>\\dot V</math>'' or '''Q''' = [[Volumetric flow rate|Volume flow rate]],\n*''&rho;'' = mass [[density]] of the fluid,\n*'''v''' = [[Flow velocity]] of the mass elements,\n*'''A''' = [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] [[vector area]]/surface,\n* '''j'''<sub>m</sub> = [[mass flux]].\n\nThe above equation is only true for a flat, plane area. In general, including cases where the area is curved, the equation becomes a [[surface integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\iint_A \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = \\iint_A \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nThe [[area]] required to calculate the mass flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. E.g. for substances passing through a [[Filter paper|filter]] or a [[Artificial membrane|membrane]], the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopically]] - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered. The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>. The relation is <math>\\mathbf{A} = A \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>.\n\nThe reason for the [[dot product]] is as follows. The only mass flowing ''through'' the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, i.e. [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the unit normal. This amount is:  \n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos\\theta </math>\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the unit normal <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math> and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor <math>\\cos\\theta </math>, as ''\u03b8'' increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is [[perpendicular]] to the unit normal, ''doesn't'' actually pass ''through'' the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when ''\u03b8'' = ''\u03c0''/2:\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0</math>\nThese results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.\n\nConsidering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced. It is related with [[superficial velocity]], v<sub>s</sub>, with the following relationship:\n:<math>\\dot m_s = v_s \\cdot \\rho = \\dot m/A </math><ref>Lindeburg M. R. Chemical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam. \u2013 Professional Publications (CA), 2013.</ref>\nThe quantity can be used in [[Reynolds number#Object in a fluid|particle Reynolds number]] or mass transfer coefficient calculation for fixed and fluidized bed systems.\n\n==Usage==\n\nIn the elementary form of the [[continuity equation]] for mass, in [[hydrodynamics]]:<ref>Essential Principles of Physics, P.M.

He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''Histor\u00edai''), a detailed record of his \"inquiry\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} [[History#Etymology|''histor\u00eda'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as \"[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]],\" a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC [[Roman Empire|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]].<ref>T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nDespite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes many obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. However, Herodotus states that he is merely reporting what he has seen and been told, on several occasions saying that he does not himself believe the story that he reports. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.\n\n==Place in history==\nHerodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories:''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''. The original title can be translated from the Greek as \"researches\" or \"inquiries\".<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herodotus \"Herodotus\"] ''Encyclopedia of World Biography.'' The Gale Group. Retrieved March 11, 2018.</ref>}}\n\n{{quotation|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.|Herodotus, ''The Histories''<br>\nRobin Waterfield translation (2008)}}\n\n===Predecessors===\nHis record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus' work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history,\"<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as \"Heliopolitans\" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>\n\nBut Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name=\"OswynMurray\" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904\u2013920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181\u2013182, n. 904\u2013920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary and modern critics===\nIt is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics have branded him \"The Father of Lies.\"<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\">{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}</ref> Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|\nHerodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

Taylor and Francis. p.&nbsp;174</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] dismissed Herodotus as a \"logos-writer\" (story-teller).<ref name=\"OswynMurray_a\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=191}}</ref> Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.<ref>Waterfield, Robin (trans.) and Dewald, Carolyn (ed.). (1998). ''The Histories by Herodotus''. University of Oxford Press. \u201cIntroduction\u201d, p.&nbsp;xviii</ref> Moreover, Thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the Greek world-view: focused on the context of the ''[[polis]]'' or city-state. The interplay of civilizations was more relevant to Greeks living in Anatolia, such as Herodotus himself, for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent memory.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_a\" />\n{{quotation|Before the Persian crisis, history had been represented among the Greeks only by local or family traditions. The \"Wars of Liberation\" had given to Herodotus the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a Greek.

With him, the spirit of history was born into Greece; and his work, called after the nine Muses, was indeed the first utterance of [[Clio]].|[[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]]<ref>Richard C.

His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&nbsp;BC. \n\nThe epic poet [[Panyassis]] \u2013 a relative of Herodotus \u2013 is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. \n\nThe ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454&nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] \u2013 a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u201355), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium,\" and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces.\" These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable,\" so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p.&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade \u2013 by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p.&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, \"Your son's soul yearns for knowledge.\"\n\nEventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''in Vita. Thucyd.'' p.&nbsp;ix, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref> According to the ''Suda'', he was buried in Macedonian [[Pella]] and in the [[agora]] in [[Thurium]].<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==Reliability==\n[[File:Dedication page for the Historiae by Herodotus printed at Venice 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dedication]] in the ''Histories'', translated into Latin by [[Lorenzo Valla]], Venice 1494]]\n''The Histories'' were occasionally criticized in antiquity,{{efn|See [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in ''Verae Historiae''.}} but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=189}}</ref> Despite the controversy,<ref>{{harvp|Mikalson|2003|pp=198\u2013200}}</ref>{{efn|Some regard his works as being at least partly unreliable.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff).

This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant.\" Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire.

A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology,\"<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography,\"<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history.\"<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9\u201316.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality.\" Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.

He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''Histor\u00edai''), a detailed record of his \"inquiry\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} [[History#Etymology|''histor\u00eda'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as \"[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]]\", a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC [[Roman Empire|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]].<ref>T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nDespite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes many obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. However, Herodotus states that he is merely reporting what he has seen and been told, on several occasions saying that he does not himself believe the story that he reports. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.\n\n==Place in history==\nHerodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories:''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''. The original title can be translated from the Greek as \"researches\" or \"inquiries\".<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herodotus \"Herodotus\"] ''Encyclopedia of World Biography.'' The Gale Group. Retrieved March 11, 2018.</ref>}}\n\n{{quotation|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.|Herodotus, ''The Histories''<br>\nRobin Waterfield translation (2008)}}\n\n===Predecessors===\nHis record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus' work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history\",<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as \"Heliopolitans\" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>\n\nBut Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name=\"OswynMurray\" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904\u2013920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181\u2013182, n. 904\u2013920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary and modern critics===\nIt is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics have branded him \"The Father of Lies\".<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\">{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}</ref> Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|\nHerodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

Taylor and Francis. p.&nbsp;174</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] dismissed Herodotus as a \"logos-writer\" (story-teller).<ref name=\"OswynMurray_a\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=191}}</ref> Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.<ref>Waterfield, Robin (trans.) and Dewald, Carolyn (ed.). (1998). ''The Histories by Herodotus''. University of Oxford Press. \u201cIntroduction\u201d, p.&nbsp;xviii</ref> Moreover, Thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the Greek world-view: focused on the context of the ''[[polis]]'' or city-state. The interplay of civilizations was more relevant to Greeks living in Anatolia, such as Herodotus himself, for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent memory.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_a\" />\n{{quotation|Before the Persian crisis, history had been represented among the Greeks only by local or family traditions. The \"Wars of Liberation\" had given to Herodotus the first genuinely historical inspiration felt by a Greek.

There is no reason to disbelieve the ''Suda''<nowiki/>'s information about his family: that it was influential and that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of Theodorus, and that he was also related to [[Panyassis]] \u2013 an epic poet of the time.\n\nThe town was within the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] at that time, making Herodotus a Persian subject,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M.

His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&nbsp;BC. \n\nThe epic poet [[Panyassis]] \u2013 a relative of Herodotus \u2013 is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. \n\nThe ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454&nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] \u2013 a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u201355), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium\", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces\". These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable\", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p.&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade \u2013 by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p.&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, \"Your son's soul yearns for knowledge.\"\n\nEventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they \"saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards\", although, being unaware of the existence of the southern hemisphere, he says that he does not believe the claim. Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/ |title=Herodotus on the First Circumnavigation of Africa |year=1996 |access-date=12 June 2019 |work=[[Livius.org]]}}\n</ref> His accounts of India are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_307.gif |title=The Indian Empire |work=[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]] |year=1909 |volume=2 |page=272 |via=[[Digital South Asia Library]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Jain\">{{cite book |last=Jain |first=Meenakshi |title=The India They Saw: Foreign Accounts |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=[[Prabhat Prakashan]] |location=Delhi |isbn=978-81-8430-106-9 |volume=1-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlMkBQAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |year=1981 |title=The Classical Accounts of India: Being a Compilation of the English Translations of the Accounts Left by Herodotus, Megasthenes, Arrian, Strabo, Quintus, Diodorus, Siculus, Justin, Plutarch, Frontinus, Nearchus, Apollonius, Pliny, Ptolemy, Aelian, and Others with Maps |location=Calcutta |publisher=Firma KLM |pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicalaccounts/page/n523 504] |url=https://archive.org/details/classicalaccounts |oclc=247581880}}</ref>\n\nDiscoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to Herodotus's credibility. He described [[Gelonus]], located in [[Scythia]], as a city thousands of times larger than [[Troy]]; this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975. The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called \"Naucratis stela\" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]].\n[[File:Claude Vignon - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.jpg|thumb|left|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]\n\nAfter journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\">{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}</ref> In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry \"[[ant]]s\" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant\". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Marlise |last=Simons |author-link=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |access-date=23 February 2016 |page=5 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the \"ants\" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.\n\n===Accusations of bias===\nSome \"calumnious fictions\" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case \"a great collector of slanders\"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom ''Orat. xxxvii, p11 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 an account also given by [[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]] in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''</ref> In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece.

A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology\",<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography\",<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history\".<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9\u201316.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality\". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.
