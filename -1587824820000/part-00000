In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed.

From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed.

It has not been confirmed whether the Rimmer onboard ship is the one who originally left, the revived version, or a third incarnation entirely; however, episodes have alluded to him remembering events from both previous incarnations' lives.\n\n==Characters and actors==\n{{Main|List of Red Dwarf characters}}\n* [[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc (\"Bronze swimming certificate\" and \"Silver swimming certificate\"), played by [[Chris Barrie]], was the second-lowest-ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neuroticism|neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself) except Lister. Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 24\u201330.</ref> because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become his swashbuckling dimensional counterpart, Ace Rimmer. Along with the ''Red Dwarf'' ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with [[Death (personification)|Death]] at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. From ''Back to Earth'' onwards, he is once again a hologram, although to what circumstances lead to this is never elaborated.\n* [[Dave Lister]], played by [[Craig Charles]], is a genial [[Scouser]] and self-described bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident. Lister survived the accident, as he was in stasis for smuggling an unquarantined cat on board. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\">Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 19\u201324.</ref> He likes [[Indian food]], especially chicken [[vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.\n[[File:Red Dwarf cast.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], and [[Kryten]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth'']]\n* The [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], played by [[Danny John-Jules]], is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes. He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time, and begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human. It is later revealed that, unlike his human companions, he has a \"cool\" sounding pulse, six nipples, and colour-coordinated internal organs.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 30\u201334.</ref>\n* [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] (played by [[Norman Lovett]] in series I, II, VIII, The Promised Land and a guest appearance in each of series VII and XII; and [[Hattie Hayridge]] in series III to V), is the ship's computer. Holly has a functional [[IQ]] of 6000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338.</ref> Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the [[Nanarchy|nanobots who stole ''Red Dwarf'']]. From ''Back to Earth'' to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing [[offscreen]], caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline.\n* [[Kryten]], full name Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by [[Robert Llewellyn]] from series III onwards, and as a one-off appearance in series II by [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]), was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship ''Nova 5'' in series II, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years.

Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her. Lister is advised by fans of the television series to find her in \"the next series\" and to make amends.

Many visual and character elements bear similarities to the Trident nuclear submarine BBC documentary ''Defence of the Realm''.

With the main characters routinely displaying their cowardice, incompetence and laziness, while exchanging insulting and sarcastic dialogue, the series provided a humorous antidote to the fearless and morally upright space explorers typically found in science-fiction series,<ref name=\"screenonline: Red Dwarf\"/> with its main characters acting bravely only when there was no other possible alternative. The increasing science-fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other television series, films and books. These have included references to the likes of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968),<ref name=\"2001: A Space Odyssey parody\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=2&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing |title=Red Dwarf series II Writing |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=17 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421163512/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=2&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing |archivedate=21 April 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986),<ref name=\"Top Gun influences\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=4&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=music |title=Red Dwarf: Series IV music |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=17 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230251/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=4&subsectionID=music |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1942), ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984),<ref name=\"GreatDebate\"/> ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), Isaac Asimov's [[Robot series|''Robot'' series]] (1939\u20131985) and the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe writers based the whole theme of some episodes on the plots of feature films. The series III episode \"Polymorph\" references and parodies key moments from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979); from series IV, \"[[Camille (Red Dwarf)|Camille]]\" echoes key scenes from ''Casablanca'' (1942),<ref name=\"GreatDebate\"/> while \"[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]\" borrows the main plot from ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973). For series IX, \"[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]\" was partially inspired by ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=121&title=red_dwarf_back_to_earth_this_weekend_s_e_1&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |title='Red Dwarf: Back To Earth' \u2013 This Weekend's Essential Viewing |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=9 April 2009 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=15 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011201714/http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=121&title=red_dwarf_back_to_earth_this_weekend_s_e_1&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> The series' themes are not limited to films or television, having also incorporated historical events and figures.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 67\u201368.</ref> Religion also plays a part in the series, as a significant factor in the ultimate fate of the Cat race, and the perception of Lister as their 'God', both within the episode \"[[Waiting for God (Red Dwarf)|Waiting for God]]\"<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 48\u201349.</ref> (whose title makes a literary reference to the [[Samuel Beckett]] play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''), as well as the crew meeting a man they believe to be [[Jesus]] Christ in series X episode \"[[Lemons (Red Dwarf)|Lemons]]\". The series VII episode titled \"[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]\" derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]]. The third episode of series VI \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\" was based on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the [[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.\n\n[[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]] do not feature in the series, as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually addressed with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/analysis/ten-moments-that-shaped-red-dwarf/index.cfm |title=Ten Moments That Shaped Red Dwarf |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307064851/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/analysis/ten-moments-that-shaped-red-dwarf/index.cfm |archivedate=7 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Hallmarks==\n{{Main|List of Red Dwarf concepts}}\nThe series developed its own distinct vocabulary.

The second novel, ''[[Better Than Life]]'', followed in October 1990, and is largely based on the second-series episode of the same name.

These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of [[Waiting for God (TV series)|another comedy series]] (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]\" and \"[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf series V Aftermath\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath |title=Red Dwarf series V Aftermath |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230342/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=5&subsectionID=aftermath |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context.

According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/>\n\nThe studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227.</ref> The intention was to shoot a \"promo video\" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as \"a garage\".<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat (now depicted as female) and Rimmer,<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] and Anthony Fusco, respectively.<ref name=\"Resume\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |title=Red Dwarf (1992) |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218085224/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |archivedate=18 February 2017}}</ref> This meant that, unlike the original British series, the cast was all Caucasian, which Charles referred to as \"White Dwarf\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |title=Red Dwarf USA unaired pilot |date=February 2010 |website=The Red Dwarf Section |accessdate=28 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909061544/http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |archivedate=9 September 2016}}</ref> Chris Barrie was asked to play Rimmer in the second pilot, but he declined. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', in which she was cast as [[Jadzia Dax]]. Similarly, one year later [[Jane Leeves]] was cast in ''[[Frasier]]'' as [[Daphne Moon]].\n\nThe cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister, who is portrayed in the British version as a likeable slob, but in the U.S. version as somewhat clean-cut.

Four novels were published from 1989 to 1996. Two [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] of an American version of the show were produced but never aired. The magazine ''The Red Dwarf Smegazine'' was published from 1992 to 1994.\n\nOne of the series' highest accolades came in 1994, when an episode from the sixth series, \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\", won an International [[Emmy Award]] in the Popular Arts category, and in the same year the series was also awarded \"Best BBC Comedy Series\" at the [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web

It has not been confirmed whether the Rimmer onboard ship is the one who originally left, the revived version, or a third incarnation entirely; however, episodes have alluded to him remembering events from both previous incarnations' lives.\n\n==Characters and actors==\n{{Main|List of Red Dwarf characters}}\n* [[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc (\"Bronze swimming certificate\" and \"Silver swimming certificate\"), played by [[Chris Barrie]], was the second-lowest-ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neuroticism|neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself) except Lister. Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 24\u201330.</ref> because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become his swashbuckling dimensional counterpart, Ace Rimmer. Along with the ''Red Dwarf'' ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with [[Death (personification)|Death]] at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. From ''Back to Earth'' onwards, he is once again a hologram, although to what circumstances lead to this is never elaborated.\n* [[Dave Lister]], played by [[Craig Charles]], is a genial [[Scouser]] and self-described bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident. Lister survived the accident, as he was in stasis for smuggling an unquarantined cat on board. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\">Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 19\u201324.</ref> He likes [[Indian food]], especially chicken [[vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.\n[[File:Red Dwarf cast.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], and [[Kryten]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth'']]\n* The [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], played by [[Danny John-Jules]], is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes. He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time, and begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human. It is later revealed that, unlike his human companions, he has a \"cool\" sounding pulse, six nipples, and colour-coordinated internal organs.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 30\u201334.</ref>\n* [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] (played by [[Norman Lovett]] in series I, II, VIII, The Promised Land and a guest appearance in each of series VII and XII; and [[Hattie Hayridge]] in series III to V), is the ship's computer. Holly has a functional [[IQ]] of 6000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338.</ref> Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the [[Nanarchy|nanobots who stole ''Red Dwarf'']]. From ''Back to Earth'' to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing [[offscreen]], caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline.\n* [[Kryten]], full name Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by [[Robert Llewellyn]] from series III onwards, and as a one-off appearance in series II by [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]), was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship ''Nova 5'' in series II, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years.

She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses.<ref name=\"Series VII review at DVD Active\"/> By the first episode of the ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'' specials, Lister believes her dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her \"death\") had lied to Lister.

The increasing science-fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other television series, films and books.

The series VII episode titled \"[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]\" derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]]. The third episode of series VI \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\" was based on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the [[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.\n\n[[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]] do not feature in the series, as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually addressed with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature.

These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of [[Waiting for God (TV series)|another comedy series]] (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]\" and \"[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf series V Aftermath\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath |title=Red Dwarf series V Aftermath |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230342/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=5&subsectionID=aftermath |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context.

According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/>\n\nThe studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227.</ref> The intention was to shoot a \"promo video\" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as \"a garage\".<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat (now depicted as female) and Rimmer,<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] and Anthony Fusco, respectively.<ref name=\"Resume\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |title=Red Dwarf (1992) |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218085224/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |archivedate=18 February 2017}}</ref> This meant that, unlike the original British series, the cast was all Caucasian, which Charles referred to as \"White Dwarf\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |title=Red Dwarf USA unaired pilot |date=February 2010 |website=The Red Dwarf Section |accessdate=28 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909061544/http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |archivedate=9 September 2016}}</ref> Chris Barrie was asked to play Rimmer in the second pilot, but he declined. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', in which she was cast as [[Jadzia Dax]]. Similarly, one year later [[Jane Leeves]] was cast in ''[[Frasier]]'' as [[Daphne Moon]].\n\nThe cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister, who is portrayed in the British version as a likeable slob, but in the U.S. version as somewhat clean-cut.

''Darwin Online: On the Origin of Species'', 2002.</ref> published on 24 November 1859, is a work of [[scientific literature]] by [[Charles Darwin]] which is considered to be the foundation of [[evolutionary biology]].{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=477}} Darwin's book introduced the [[scientific theory]] that populations [[evolution|evolve]] over the course of generations through a process of [[natural selection]]. It presented a body of evidence that [[biodiversity|the diversity of life]] arose by [[common descent]] through a [[tree of life (science)|branching pattern of evolution]]. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the ''Beagle'' expedition]] in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darwin Manuscripts (Digitised notes on Origin)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/darwin_mss|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[History of evolutionary thought|Various evolutionary ideas]] had already been proposed to explain [[History of biology|new findings in biology]]. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the [[Church of England]], while science was part of [[natural theology]]. Ideas about the [[transmutation of species]] were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.\n\nThe book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.&nbsp;H. Huxley]] and his fellow members of the [[X Club]] to [[Secularity|secularise]] science by promoting [[Naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]]. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During \"[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary [[adaptation]] through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the [[life science]]s.\n\nOk \n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of evolutionary thought|History of biology}}\n\n===Developments before Darwin's theory===\nIn later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as [[Aristotle]];<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=18 xiii]}}</ref> the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]].<ref>{{Citation|author=Aristotle|title=Physics|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html|accessdate=23 April 2009|publisher=translated by Hardie, R.

Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and [[spontaneous generation]] of life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=27, 43, 45}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] inspired [[Biblical literalism|a literal interpretation of the Bible]], with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an [[Scientific Revolution|emerging science]] seeking explanations congruent with the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and the [[empiricism]] of the [[Baconian method]]. After the turmoil of the [[English Civil War]], the [[Royal Society]] wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. [[John Ray]] developed an influential [[natural theology]] of rational order; in his [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[species]] were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and [[Subspecies|varieties]] showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by [[parasitism]] was a [[problem of evil|puzzling problem]]. The [[biological classification]] introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, [[Georges Buffon]] suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The [[Ussher chronology]] of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004&nbsp;BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Werner]]ians thought [[stratum|strata]] were [[Neptunism|deposits from shrinking seas]], but [[James Hutton]] proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=27\u201336, 39\u201342, 57\u201362, 67, 70, 77\u201380}}</ref>\n\nCharles Darwin's grandfather [[Erasmus Darwin]] outlined a hypothesis of [[transmutation of species]] in the 1790s, and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called [[Lamarckism]]. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=84\u201390}}</ref> [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]] contended that [[recapitulation theory|embryonic development recapitulated]] transformations of organisms in past [[era]]s when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by [[Homology (biology)|homologies]]. [[Georges Cuvier]] strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=47\u201354}}</ref> His [[history of paleontology|pal\u00e6ontological work]] in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local [[catastrophism|catastrophes]], followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=111\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nIn Britain, [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology'' saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial [[Teleological argument|\"design\" by the Creator]] acting through natural laws.

''Vestiges'' used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored [[adaptation]].

Reminded of his lack of expertise in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], Darwin began an eight-year study of [[barnacle]]s, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered [[homology (biology)|homologies]] showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in the evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].<ref name=bowl169>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=169\u2013173}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=121 117\u2013121]}}</ref>\n\nDarwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his ''Beagle''-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of [[Genetic divergence|evolutionary divergence]] was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that [[Allopatric speciation|species formed in isolated populations only]], as on islands, to an emphasis on [[Sympatric speciation|speciation without isolation]]; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new [[ecological niche]]s. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in [[fancy pigeon]] breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]]) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.<ref name=bowl169/><ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=138\u2013142}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Publication==\n{{Main|Publication of Darwin's theory}}\n\n===Time taken to publish===\nIn his autobiography, Darwin said he had \"gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=128&itemID=F1497&viewtype=text 124]}}</ref> On the first page of his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up \"some short notes\" after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and \"from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.\"<ref name=\"vW time to publish\" />{{sfn|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=16&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 1]}}\n\nVarious biographers have proposed that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. [[Charles Darwin's illness]] caused repeated delays. His paper on [[Glen Roy]] had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. [[David Quammen]] has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=84\u201392}}</ref>\n\nA more recent study by science historian [[John van Wyhe]] has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin's contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another. While he was researching, he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. He firmly intended to publish, but it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full-time. His 1846 estimate that writing his \"big book\" would take five years proved optimistic.<ref name=\"vW time to publish\">{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Events leading to publication: \"big book\" manuscript===\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|A photograph of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823\u20131913) taken in [[Singapore]] in 1862]]\nAn 1855 paper on the \"introduction\" of species, written by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species.<ref>{{citation | last=Wallace | first=Alfred R. | title=On the law which has regulated the introduction of new species |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History | year=1855 | volume=16 | issue=93 | pages=184\u2013196 | url= http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A11&pageseq=1 | doi=10.1080/037454809495509}}</ref> [[Charles Lyell]] recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1\u20132 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \"sketch\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his \"big book\" on ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]''.

He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to \"publish this Abstract\" of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory:\n<blockquote>\nAs many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=20 5].}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nStarting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a sketch of the historical development of evolutionary ideas.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=1}}</ref> In that sketch he acknowledged that [[Patrick Matthew]] had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831;<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F381&pageseq=20 xiii].}}</ref> in the fourth edition he mentioned that [[William Charles Wells]] had done so as early as 1813.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1866|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F385&pageseq=21 xiv\u2013xv].}}</ref>\n\n===Variation under domestication and under nature===\nChapter I covers [[animal husbandry]] and [[plant breeding]], going back to [[ancient Egypt]]. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by [[selective breeding]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=7}}</ref> As an illustration of [[artificial selection]], he describes [[fancy pigeon]] breeding,<ref name=q184/> noting that \"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\", yet all were descended from one species of [[rock pigeon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=35 20\u201328 ]}}</ref> Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \"sports\" or \"monstrosities\" (example: [[Ancon sheep]] with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons).<ref name=rez>David Reznick (2009) ''The Origin Then and Now'', Princeton University Press, p.49.</ref> Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution.

(2000), \"Darwin on Variation and heredity\", Journal of the History of Biology\" '''33''', pp. 425-455</ref>\n\nIn Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between [[species]] and [[Variety (biology)|varieties]] is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that \"a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species\" and that \"species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=59 44\u201359 Chap. II].}}</ref> He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=44}}</ref> Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the [[archetype]] of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God.

I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.<ref name=dar5960/>\n</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that both [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|A. P. de Candolle]] and [[Charles Lyell]] had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase \"[[The struggle for existence|struggle for existence]]\" in \"a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another\"; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: \"It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.\" He discusses checks to such increase including complex [[ecology|ecological]] interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms \"which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=77 62\u201376]}}</ref>\n\nChapter IV details natural selection under the \"infinitely complex and close-fitting&nbsp;... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=95 80]}}</ref> Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying:\n<blockquote>\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=127 112]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHistorians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an [[ecological niche]].<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=189}}</ref> He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.\n\n[[File:Darwin divergence.jpg|thumb|350px|This tree diagram, used to show the divergence of species, is the only illustration in the ''Origin of Species''.]]\n\nDarwin proposes [[sexual selection]], driven by competition between males for mates, to explain [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=102 87\u2013101]}}</ref> He analysed sexual selection more fully in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could \"see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection\". Using a [[Phylogenetic tree|tree diagram]] and calculations, he indicates the \"divergence of character\" from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in \"the great [[Tree of life (science)|Tree of life]]&nbsp;... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=133 117\u2013130].}}</ref>\n\n===Variation and heredity===\nIn Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of [[heredity]];<ref>{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=85}}</ref> in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=28 13]}}</ref> He accepted a version of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] (which after Darwin's death came to be called [[Lamarckism]]), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\", and that this also applied in nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=152 134].}}</ref> Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island-dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of ''Origin'', Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors.<ref>{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=86\u201387}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=149 131\u2013150]}}</ref> However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection.<ref name=rez /> The ''observation'' that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of ''understanding'' of the underlying hereditary mechanism.\n\nBreeding of animals and plants showed related varieties varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating [[common descent]]. He recounted how [[Lord Morton's mare]] apparently demonstrated [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=159\u2013167}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=177 159\u2013167]}}</ref>\n\nMore detail was given in Darwin's 1868 book on ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Although Darwin had privately questioned [[blending inheritance]], he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen,<ref name=\"flowering of genetics\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/08/peopleinscience.evolution |title=An early flowering of genetics, Books |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |date=8 February 2003 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=24 October 2010}}</ref> and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable.<ref name=\"Bowler 200\">{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> It was not until the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|1989}}</ref> This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories of evolution with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theories of genetic inheritance.<ref>McBride, P.

Journal of Biological Education, 43(3), 104\u2013107.</ref>\n\n===Difficulties for the theory===\nChapter VI begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, \"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?  Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 page 171]}}</ref> Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 171\u2013178]}}</ref> This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.\n\nAnother difficulty, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection \"innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\" and wondered \"why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 page 172]}}</ref> (For further discussion of these difficulties, see [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?]] and Bernstein et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=Sex and the emergence of species |journal=J.

Darwin said:\n<blockquote>\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 171\u2013172]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHis answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented [[flying squirrels]], and [[flying lemurs]] as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=198 180\u2013181]}}</ref> He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the [[evolution of the eye|vertebrate eye could have evolved]]. Darwin concludes: \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=205 187\u2013190]}}</ref>\n\nIn a section on \"organs of little apparent importance\", Darwin discusses the difficulty of explaining various seemingly trivial traits with no evident adaptive function, and outlines some possibilities such as correlation with useful features. He accepts that we \"are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\" which distinguish [[Domestication|domesticated]] breeds of animals,<ref>{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=194\u2013199}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=215&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 197\u2013199]}}, Quote: \"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries\"</ref> and [[Race (human categorization)|human races]]. He suggests that [[sexual selection]] might explain these variations:<ref>{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}<br>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&itemID=F944&viewtype=text vi]}}, Quote: \"\u2026 I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man.\"</ref>{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|2009|p=310}}\n<blockquote>\nI might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.<ref name=\"OTOoS 199\">{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 199]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nChapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: [[slave-making ant]]s and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded:\n<blockquote>\nFinally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, \u2014ants making slaves, \u2014the larv\u00e6 of ichneumonid\u00e6 feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, \u2014not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=261 243\u2013244]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nChapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: \"Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=263 245\u2013278]}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to [[George Jackson Mivart]]'s criticisms, including his claim that features such as [[baleen]] filters in whales, [[flatfish]] with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of [[Phasmatodea|stick insects]] could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=196 168\u2013205]}}</ref>\n\n===Geological record===\nChapter IX deals with the fact that the [[geological record]] appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable [[transitional fossil]]s expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed [[Charles Lyell]]'s argument in ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' that the record is extremely imperfect as [[fossil]]isation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geological formations]], and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well-founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms.<ref name=bowl182>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=182}}</ref><ref name=punkeek>{{Citation |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/punc-eq.html#pe-vs-pg |title=Punctuated Equilibria |author=Wesley R.

Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=324 306\u2013308]}}</ref> Fossil evidence of [[pre-Cambrian]] life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schopf|2000}}</ref>\n\nChapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at [[phyletic gradualism|the same rate]] \u2013 some organisms such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'' were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment.<ref name=darX/> This distanced his theory from [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] laws of inevitable progress.<ref name=bowl182/> It has been argued that this anticipated the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis,<ref name=punkeek/><ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|1987}}</ref> but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=108}}</ref> He cited [[Richard Owen]]'s findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor.<ref name=bowl182/> Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and [[William Clift]] had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.<ref name=darX>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=330 312\u2013345]}}</ref>\n\n===Geographic distribution===\nChapter XI deals with evidence from [[biogeography]], starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=368 350\u2013351]}}</ref> Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=364 346\u2013382]}}</ref>\n\nChapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says:\n\n<blockquote>\n...&nbsp;I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent&nbsp;... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=426 408\u2013409]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs===\nChapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a ''[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]]'', a multilevel system of groups and sub-groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes:\n\n<blockquote>\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=438 420]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDarwin discusses [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the importance of [[homology (biology)|homologous structures]]. He says, \"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\" This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even [[Richard Owen]] had admitted, but the \"explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications\" showing [[common descent]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=452 434\u2013435]}}</ref> He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar [[embryology|embryos]].

Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows.

[[Herbert Spencer]] had already incorporated [[Lamarckism]] into his popular philosophy of progressive [[free market]] human society. He popularised the terms ''evolution'' and ''[[survival of the fittest]]'', and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=203\u2013207, 220\u2013222}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on the scientific community===\n{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}\nScientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to [[Physical law|laws of nature]], but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \"law of development\" of ''Vestiges'' had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented [[natural selection]] as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as [[inheritance of acquired characters]] were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the [[empiricism]] of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic]]'', while opponents held to the idealist school of [[William Whewell]]'s ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'', in which investigation could begin with the intuitive idea that species were fixed objects created by design.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=179\u2013180, 197\u2013198}}</ref> Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying [[biogeography]] and ecology, including [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] in 1860, and [[Asa Gray]] in 1862. [[Henry Walter Bates]] presented research in 1861 that explained [[Batesian mimicry|insect mimicry]] using natural selection. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] discussed evidence from his [[Malay archipelago]] research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the [[Wallace line]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=183\u2013184, 189}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|left|300px|thumb|[[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] used illustrations to show that humans and apes had the same basic skeletal structure.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=208}}</ref>]]\nEvolution had less obvious applications to [[anatomy]] and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].<ref name=\"Bowler184-185\">{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=184\u2013185}}</ref> Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's [[gradualism]] was sufficient without [[Saltation (biology)|sudden leaps]] to cause [[speciation]].

[[Heinrich Georg Bronn|Bronn]]'s alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives, but enthused political radicals.

Haeckel used [[embryology]] extensively in his [[recapitulation theory]], which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that [[Karl Ernst von Baer|von Baer's]] laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.<ref name=\"Bowler190_191\">{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=169\u2013170, 190\u2013192}}</ref>\n\n[[Asa Gray]] promoted and defended ''Origin'' against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably [[Louis Agassiz]] who viewed every species as a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties.<ref>Dupree, pp. 216\u2013232</ref> [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]] reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] involving recapitulation theory.<ref name=bowler186>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=186\u2013187, 237, 241}}</ref>\n\nFrench-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much-modified French translation by [[Cl\u00e9mence Royer]], but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism.<ref name=browne142/> The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by [[Karl Marx]] and by [[Leo Tolstoy]], who had the character Levin in his novel ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.<ref name=browne256/>\n\n====Challenges to natural selection====\nThere were serious scientific objections to the process of [[natural selection]] as the key mechanism of evolution, including [[Karl Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli|Karl von N\u00e4geli]]'s insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the [[age of the Earth]] allowed gradual evolution was disputed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin)]], who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted [[blending inheritance]], but [[Fleeming Jenkin]] calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the fifth edition. [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]] supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.<ref name=miv/><ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=198\u2013200, 234\u2013236}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \"[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]\" included forms of \"[[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]]\" in which new species were thought to arise through \"jumps\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of [[orthogenesis]] claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of [[August Weismann]], that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called [[neo-Darwinism]]. It was thought that the rediscovery of [[Mendelian inheritance]] invalidated Darwin's views.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=225}}</ref><ref name=Quammen205-234>{{Harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=205\u2013234}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on economic and political debates===\nWhile some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including [[Walter Bagehot]]'s ''Physics and Politics'' (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in [[anthropology]] to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] over non-white races and justify European [[imperialism]]. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed [[polygenism]], the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=294\u2013307}}</ref>\n\n===Religious attitudes===\nThe book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation.

In the 1872 sixth edition \"On\" was omitted, so the full title is ''The origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.'' This edition is usually known as ''The Origin of Species.'' The 6th is Darwin's final edition; there were minor modifications in the text of certain subsequent issues. See Freeman, R. B. \"[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_OntheOriginofSpecies.html The works of Charles Darwin: an annotated bibliographical handlist.]\" In Van Wyhe, John, ed. ''Darwin Online: On the Origin of Species'', 2002.</ref> published on 24 November 1859, is a work of [[scientific literature]] by [[Charles Darwin]] which is considered to be the foundation of [[evolutionary biology]].{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=477}} Darwin's book introduced the [[scientific theory]] that populations [[evolution|evolve]] over the course of generations through a process of [[natural selection]]. It presented a body of evidence that [[biodiversity|the diversity of life]] arose by [[common descent]] through a [[tree of life (science)|branching pattern of evolution]]. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the ''Beagle'' expedition]] in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darwin Manuscripts (Digitised notes on Origin)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/darwin_mss|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[History of evolutionary thought|Various evolutionary ideas]] had already been proposed to explain [[History of biology|new findings in biology]]. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the [[Church of England]], while science was part of [[natural theology]]. Ideas about the [[transmutation of species]] were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.\n\nThe book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.&nbsp;H. Huxley]] and his fellow members of the [[X Club]] to [[Secularity|secularise]] science by promoting [[Naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]]. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During \"[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary [[adaptation]] through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the [[life science]]s.\n\n==Summary of Darwin's theory==\n[[File:Charles Darwin seated.jpg|thumb|upright|Darwin pictured shortly before publication]]\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution is based on key [[fact]]s and the [[inference]]s drawn from them, which biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] summarised as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=479\u2013480}}</ref>\n\n:* Every [[species]] is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).\n:* Despite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact).\n:* Resources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact).\n:* A [[struggle for existence|struggle for survival]] ensues (inference).\n:* Individuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact).\n:* Much of this variation is [[heredity|heritable]] (fact).\n:* Individuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of [[natural selection]] (fact).\n:* This slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference).\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of evolutionary thought|History of biology}}\n\n===Developments before Darwin's theory===\nIn later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as [[Aristotle]];<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=18 xiii]}}</ref> the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]].<ref>{{Citation|author=Aristotle|title=Physics|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html|accessdate=23 April 2009|publisher=translated by Hardie, R.

Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and [[spontaneous generation]] of life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=27, 43, 45}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Georges Cuvier - Elephant jaw.png|thumb|left|Cuvier's 1799 paper on living and fossil elephants helped establish the reality of [[extinction]].]]\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] inspired [[Biblical literalism|a literal interpretation of the Bible]], with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an [[Scientific Revolution|emerging science]] seeking explanations congruent with the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and the [[empiricism]] of the [[Baconian method]]. After the turmoil of the [[English Civil War]], the [[Royal Society]] wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. [[John Ray]] developed an influential [[natural theology]] of rational order; in his [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[species]] were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and [[Subspecies|varieties]] showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by [[parasitism]] was a [[problem of evil|puzzling problem]]. The [[biological classification]] introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, [[Georges Buffon]] suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The [[Ussher chronology]] of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004&nbsp;BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Werner]]ians thought [[stratum|strata]] were [[Neptunism|deposits from shrinking seas]], but [[James Hutton]] proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=27\u201336, 39\u201342, 57\u201362, 67, 70, 77\u201380}}</ref>\n\nCharles Darwin's grandfather [[Erasmus Darwin]] outlined a hypothesis of [[transmutation of species]] in the 1790s, and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called [[Lamarckism]]. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=84\u201390}}</ref> [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]] contended that [[recapitulation theory|embryonic development recapitulated]] transformations of organisms in past [[era]]s when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by [[Homology (biology)|homologies]]. [[Georges Cuvier]] strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=47\u201354}}</ref> His [[history of paleontology|pal\u00e6ontological work]] in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local [[catastrophism|catastrophes]], followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=111\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nIn Britain, [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology'' saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial [[Teleological argument|\"design\" by the Creator]] acting through natural laws. All naturalists in the two English universities ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]) were [[Church of England]] clergymen, and science became a search for these laws.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=91, 129}}</ref> Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the [[Deluge (mythology)|biblical flood]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=115\u2013117}}</ref> Some anatomists such as [[Robert Edmond Grant|Robert Grant]] were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=34\u201335}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Inception of Darwin's theory===\n{{See also|Charles Darwin's education|Inception of Darwin's theory}}\nDarwin went to [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] in 1825 to study medicine.

''Vestiges'' used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored [[adaptation]].

Reminded of his lack of expertise in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], Darwin began an eight-year study of [[barnacle]]s, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered [[homology (biology)|homologies]] showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in the evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].<ref name=bowl169>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=169\u2013173}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=121 117\u2013121]}}</ref>\n\nDarwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his ''Beagle''-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of [[Genetic divergence|evolutionary divergence]] was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that [[Allopatric speciation|species formed in isolated populations only]], as on islands, to an emphasis on [[Sympatric speciation|speciation without isolation]]; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new [[ecological niche]]s. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in [[fancy pigeon]] breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]]) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.<ref name=bowl169/><ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=138\u2013142}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Publication==\n{{Main|Publication of Darwin's theory}}\n\n===Time taken to publish===\nIn his autobiography, Darwin said he had \"gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=128&itemID=F1497&viewtype=text 124]}}</ref> On the first page of his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up \"some short notes\" after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and \"from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.\"<ref name=\"vW time to publish\" />{{sfn|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=16&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 1]}}\n\nVarious biographers have proposed that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. [[Charles Darwin's illness]] caused repeated delays. His paper on [[Glen Roy]] had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. [[David Quammen]] has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=84\u201392}}</ref>\n\nA more recent study by science historian [[John van Wyhe]] has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin's contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another. While he was researching, he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. He firmly intended to publish, but it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full-time.

Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \"sketch\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his \"big book\" on ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]''.

While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the [[artificial selection]] practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to [[selective breeding]], and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=162\u2013163}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref> Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing [[group selection]] rather than selection acting on individual variation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowler|2013|pp=61\u201363}}</ref>\n\n===Abstract of Species book===\nSoon after the meeting, Darwin decided to write \"an abstract of my whole work\" in the form of one or more papers to be published by the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]], but was concerned about \"how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which would be impossible.\" He asked Hooker how many pages would be available, but \"If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific I would, perhaps publish it as pamphlet.\"<ref name=\"Correspondence 1858-1859: Origin\" /><ref name=\"Letter 2303\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2303 |title=Letter 2303 \u2014 Darwin, C.

He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to \"publish this Abstract\" of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory:\n<blockquote>\nAs many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=20 5].}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nStarting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a sketch of the historical development of evolutionary ideas.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=1}}</ref> In that sketch he acknowledged that [[Patrick Matthew]] had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831;<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F381&pageseq=20 xiii].}}</ref> in the fourth edition he mentioned that [[William Charles Wells]] had done so as early as 1813.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1866|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F385&pageseq=21 xiv\u2013xv].}}</ref>\n\n===Variation under domestication and under nature===\nChapter I covers [[animal husbandry]] and [[plant breeding]], going back to [[ancient Egypt]].

However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution. In this chapter Darwin expresses his erroneous belief that environmental change is necessary to generate variation.<ref>Winther, Rasmus G. (2000), \"Darwin on Variation and heredity\", Journal of the History of Biology\" '''33''', pp. 425-455</ref>\n\nIn Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between [[species]] and [[Variety (biology)|varieties]] is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that \"a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species\" and that \"species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=59 44\u201359 Chap. II].}}</ref> He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=44}}</ref> Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the [[archetype]] of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.<ref name=q184>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=184\u2013186}}</ref>\n\n===Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence===\nIn Chapter III, Darwin asks how varieties \"which I have called incipient species\" become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls \"[[natural selection]]\";<ref name=dar5960>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=75 60\u201361 Chap.

I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.<ref name=dar5960/>\n</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that both [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|A. P. de Candolle]] and [[Charles Lyell]] had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase \"[[The struggle for existence|struggle for existence]]\" in \"a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another\"; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: \"It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.\" He discusses checks to such increase including complex [[ecology|ecological]] interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms \"which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=77 62\u201376]}}</ref>\n\nChapter IV details natural selection under the \"infinitely complex and close-fitting&nbsp;... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=95 80]}}</ref> Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying:\n<blockquote>\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=127 112]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHistorians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an [[ecological niche]].<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=189}}</ref> He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.\n\n[[File:Darwin divergence.jpg|thumb|350px|This tree diagram, used to show the divergence of species, is the only illustration in the ''Origin of Species''.]]\n\nDarwin proposes [[sexual selection]], driven by competition between males for mates, to explain [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=102 87\u2013101]}}</ref> He analysed sexual selection more fully in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could \"see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection\". Using a [[Phylogenetic tree|tree diagram]] and calculations, he indicates the \"divergence of character\" from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in \"the great [[Tree of life (science)|Tree of life]]&nbsp;... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=133 117\u2013130].}}</ref>\n\n===Variation and heredity===\nIn Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of [[heredity]];<ref>{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=85}}</ref> in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=28 13]}}</ref> He accepted a version of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] (which after Darwin's death came to be called [[Lamarckism]]), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\", and that this also applied in nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=152 134].}}</ref> Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island-dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of ''Origin'', Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors.<ref>{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=86\u201387}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=149 131\u2013150]}}</ref> However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection.<ref name=rez /> The ''observation'' that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of ''understanding'' of the underlying hereditary mechanism.\n\nBreeding of animals and plants showed related varieties varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating [[common descent]]. He recounted how [[Lord Morton's mare]] apparently demonstrated [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=159\u2013167}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=177 159\u2013167]}}</ref>\n\nMore detail was given in Darwin's 1868 book on ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Although Darwin had privately questioned [[blending inheritance]], he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population.

As Darwin noted, \"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?  Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 page 171]}}</ref> Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 171\u2013178]}}</ref> This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.\n\nAnother difficulty, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection \"innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\" and wondered \"why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 page 172]}}</ref> (For further discussion of these difficulties, see [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?]] and Bernstein et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=Sex and the emergence of species |journal=J.

Darwin said:\n<blockquote>\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=189 171\u2013172]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHis answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented [[flying squirrels]], and [[flying lemurs]] as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=198 180\u2013181]}}</ref> He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the [[evolution of the eye|vertebrate eye could have evolved]]. Darwin concludes: \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=205 187\u2013190]}}</ref>\n\nIn a section on \"organs of little apparent importance\", Darwin discusses the difficulty of explaining various seemingly trivial traits with no evident adaptive function, and outlines some possibilities such as correlation with useful features. He accepts that we \"are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\" which distinguish [[Domestication|domesticated]] breeds of animals,<ref>{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=194\u2013199}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=215&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 197\u2013199]}}, Quote: \"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries\"</ref> and [[Race (human categorization)|human races]]. He suggests that [[sexual selection]] might explain these variations:<ref>{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}<br>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&itemID=F944&viewtype=text vi]}}, Quote: \"\u2026 I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man.\"</ref>{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|2009|p=310}}\n<blockquote>\nI might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.<ref name=\"OTOoS 199\">{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 199]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nChapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: [[slave-making ant]]s and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded:\n<blockquote>\nFinally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, \u2014ants making slaves, \u2014the larv\u00e6 of ichneumonid\u00e6 feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, \u2014not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=261 243\u2013244]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nChapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: \"Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=263 245\u2013278]}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to [[George Jackson Mivart]]'s criticisms, including his claim that features such as [[baleen]] filters in whales, [[flatfish]] with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of [[Phasmatodea|stick insects]] could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=196 168\u2013205]}}</ref>\n\n===Geological record===\nChapter IX deals with the fact that the [[geological record]] appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable [[transitional fossil]]s expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed [[Charles Lyell]]'s argument in ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' that the record is extremely imperfect as [[fossil]]isation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geological formations]], and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well-founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms.<ref name=bowl182>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=182}}</ref><ref name=punkeek>{{Citation |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/punc-eq.html#pe-vs-pg |title=Punctuated Equilibria |author=Wesley R. Elsberry |authorlink=Wesley R. Elsberry |year=1996 |accessdate=30 April 2009}}</ref> To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of [[Weald Basin|The Weald]] as discussed in  ''Principles of Geology'' together with other observations from [[Hugh Miller]], [[James Smith of Jordanhill]] and [[Andrew Ramsay (geologist)|Andrew Ramsay]]. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=300 282\u2013287]}}</ref> The initial appearance of entire groups of well-developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the [[Cambrian explosion]], posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=324 306\u2013308]}}</ref> Fossil evidence of [[pre-Cambrian]] life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schopf|2000}}</ref>\n\nChapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at [[phyletic gradualism|the same rate]] \u2013 some organisms such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'' were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment.<ref name=darX/> This distanced his theory from [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] laws of inevitable progress.<ref name=bowl182/> It has been argued that this anticipated the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis,<ref name=punkeek/><ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|1987}}</ref> but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=108}}</ref> He cited [[Richard Owen]]'s findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor.<ref name=bowl182/> Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and [[William Clift]] had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.<ref name=darX>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=330 312\u2013345]}}</ref>\n\n===Geographic distribution===\nChapter XI deals with evidence from [[biogeography]], starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=368 350\u2013351]}}</ref> Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=364 346\u2013382]}}</ref>\n\nChapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says:\n\n<blockquote>\n...&nbsp;I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent&nbsp;... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=426 408\u2013409]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs===\nChapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a ''[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]]'', a multilevel system of groups and sub-groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes:\n\n<blockquote>\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=438 420]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDarwin discusses [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the importance of [[homology (biology)|homologous structures]]. He says, \"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\" This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even [[Richard Owen]] had admitted, but the \"explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications\" showing [[common descent]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=452 434\u2013435]}}</ref> He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar [[embryology|embryos]]. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in [[baleen whales]], are found only in embryonic stages.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=468&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 450\u2013451]}}</ref> These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.<ref name = wyhe />\n\n===Concluding remarks===\nThe final chapter, \"Recapitulation and Conclusion\", reviews points from earlier chapters, and Darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=502&itemID=F373&viewtype=text 484\u2013488].}} Quote: \"When the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history. ...\"</ref> He suggests that psychology will be put on a new foundation and implies the relevance of his theory to the [[Human evolution|first appearance of humanity]] with the sentence that \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"<ref name = wyhe /><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=506 488]}}<br>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text 1]}}, Quote: \"\u2026 this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\"</ref> Darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us ... Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=507 489\u2013490]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs discussed under [[#Religious attitudes|''religious attitudes'']], Darwin added the phrase \"by the Creator\" from the 1860 second edition onwards, so that the ultimate sentence began \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\".<ref name=\"2nd edn p 190\" />\n\n==Structure, style, and themes==\n\n===Nature and structure of Darwin's argument===\nDarwin's aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that [[natural selection]] had been the chief agent of change.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=165 152]}}</ref> He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'', and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism.<ref name=sec/> Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary [[speciation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=183\u2013188}}</ref><ref name=bowl180>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref>\n\nLater chapters provide evidence that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism.

Unlike the still-popular ''Vestiges'', it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression.

Darwin presented [[natural selection]] as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as [[inheritance of acquired characters]] were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the [[empiricism]] of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic]]'', while opponents held to the idealist school of [[William Whewell]]'s ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'', in which investigation could begin with the intuitive idea that species were fixed objects created by design.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=179\u2013180, 197\u2013198}}</ref> Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying [[biogeography]] and ecology, including [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] in 1860, and [[Asa Gray]] in 1862.

[[Heinrich Georg Bronn|Bronn]]'s alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives, but enthused political radicals.

The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by [[Karl Marx]] and by [[Leo Tolstoy]], who had the character Levin in his novel ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.<ref name=browne256/>\n\n====Challenges to natural selection====\nThere were serious scientific objections to the process of [[natural selection]] as the key mechanism of evolution, including [[Karl Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli|Karl von N\u00e4geli]]'s insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the [[age of the Earth]] allowed gradual evolution was disputed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin)]], who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted [[blending inheritance]], but [[Fleeming Jenkin]] calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the fifth edition. [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]] supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.<ref name=miv/><ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=198\u2013200, 234\u2013236}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \"[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]\" included forms of \"[[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]]\" in which new species were thought to arise through \"jumps\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of [[orthogenesis]] claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of [[August Weismann]], that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called [[neo-Darwinism]]. It was thought that the rediscovery of [[Mendelian inheritance]] invalidated Darwin's views.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=225}}</ref><ref name=Quammen205-234>{{Harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=205\u2013234}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on economic and political debates===\nWhile some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including [[Walter Bagehot]]'s ''Physics and Politics'' (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in [[anthropology]] to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] over non-white races and justify European [[imperialism]]. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed [[polygenism]], the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=294\u2013307}}</ref>\n\n===Religious attitudes===\nThe book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation.

This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature.<ref name=bowl202/> While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, [[Charles Hodge]] argued in his 1874 critique \"What is Darwinism?\" that \"[[Darwinism]]\", defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design.<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|Marston|1999|pp=37\u201340}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hodge|1874|p=177}}</ref> Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text.<ref name=\"GrayWhatisDarwinism?\">{{Citation | last = Gray | first = Asa | author-link = Asa Gray |date=28 May 1874|title=What is Darwinism? | periodical =The Nation |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/86/71/ |accessdate=3 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226150804/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/86/71/ <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=26 February 2009}}</ref> By the early 20th century, four noted authors of ''[[The Fundamentals]]'' were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution,<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|Marston|1999|pp=41\u201343}}</ref> but [[fundamentalism]] inspired the American [[creation\u2013evolution controversy]] that began in the 1920s.

Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching [[common descent]], has become the unifying theory of the [[life science]]s.

It makes sense of the [[geological record]], biogeography, parallels in [[embryo]]nic development, [[Homology (biology)|biological homologies]], [[vestigiality]], [[cladistics]], [[phylogenetics]] and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as [[evolutionary medicine|medicine]] and agriculture.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html |title=Biography |date=21 January 2009 |publisher=[[The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online]] |accessdate=23 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=287\u2013288, 295}}</ref> Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political [[creation-evolution controversy|controversy]] has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=x}}</ref>\n\nInterest in Darwin's writings continues, and scholars have generated an extensive literature, the [[Darwin Industry]], about his life and work.

These presynaptic receptors regulate the release of [[dopamine]] into the [[synapse]], so by blocking them amisulpride increases dopamine concentrations in the synapse. This increased dopamine concentration is theorized to act on [[dopamine D1 receptor|dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors]] to relieve depressive symptoms (in dysthymia) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Itdys\"/>\n\nIt was introduced by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] in the 1990s.

The effectiveness of amisulpride in treating dysthymia and the [[negative symptoms]] of schizophrenia is believed to stem from its blockade of the [[presynaptic]] dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors. These presynaptic receptors regulate the release of [[dopamine]] into the [[synapse]], so by blocking them amisulpride increases dopamine concentrations in the synapse. This increased dopamine concentration is theorized to act on [[dopamine D1 receptor|dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors]] to relieve depressive symptoms (in dysthymia) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Itdys\"/>\n\nIt was introduced by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] in the 1990s.

The sisters lead a [[secret identity|double life]] as a trio of highly skilled [[art thieves]], stealing works of art which primarily belonged to their long-missing father, Michael Heinz, who was a famous [[art collector]] during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]].  Hitomi's [[fianc\u00e9]] is Toshio Utsumi, a clumsy young police officer who is investigating the Cat's Eye case.  Despite being a frequent visitor to the caf\u00e9 he is unaware of the double life of the girls.  Hitomi regularly informs the police in advance about her next job using a signature \"Cat's Eye\" [[calling card (crime)|calling card]], and then uses Toshio's research about the security surrounding the target to help plan the job.\n\nAt the end of the series, Heinz leaves a note for his daughters stating that he cannot reveal himself yet because the [[mafia]] may kill him, but he may appear in five years' time.  However, the \"Heinz\" turns out to be the sisters' treacherous uncle Cranaff, who betrayed Michael years earlier.  After losing a final bet to the Cat's Eye, Cranaff decides to [[atonement|atone]] for his [[sin]] by setting fire to the museum, killing himself.  Hitomi eventually admits to Toshio that she is part of Cat's Eye and flees before he can arrest her.  Toshio vows to track her down, attempting to \"arrest\" Hitomi at the airport with a wedding ring.  He resigns from the police force and travels to America to find Hitomi, but finds that she has [[amnesia|lost her memory]] due to [[viral meningitis]].  Toshio spends time with her until her memories come back, and the two rekindle their relationship.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Hitomi Kisugi|\u6765\u751f \u77b3|Kisugi Hitomi|Age 24}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Keiko Toda]]|[[Alexis Tipton]] (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')}} <ref>https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html</ref>\n:Hitomi is the main [[protagonist]] of the series.  Second daughter of Michael Heinz, Hitomi is usually the one who actually commits the [[wikt:heist|heist]]s, and is hence uniquely referred to as ''the'' Cat's Eye.  Like Rui, she is an accomplished athlete and well versed in a number of disciplines and skills ranging from [[horseback riding]] to [[safe cracking]].  She is a skilled gymnast and is able to perform complex [[acrobatic]] moves with ease and grace.  She is able to escape most restraints and [[handcuffs]] with minimal effort, and it is inferred that she is [[ambidextrous]] as well as [[double jointed]].  She is a skilled martial artist with proficiency in a number of disciplines, most notably [[judo]], [[boxing]] and [[karate]], and also has degrees in [[kendo]] and [[aikido]].  Hitomi is very charming, clever, sweet, sisterly, loyal, cunning, flirtatious, caring and kind-hearted.\n:Like Rui, Hitomi is also able to disguise her appearance effortlessly and can speak several other languages.\n;{{nihongo|Rui Kisugi|\u6765\u751f \u6cea|Kisugi Rui|Age 27}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Toshiko Fujita]], [[Keiko Toda]] (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')|Dawn M. Bennett (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')}} <ref>https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html</ref>\n:Rui is the second protagonist of the series.  Hitomi's elegant and fashionable older sister, Rui is the leader and brain of the \u201cCat's Eye\u201d group and the one who usually outlines strategies and plans the heists.  With model good looks, worldly sophistication, and a razor-sharp intelligence she is able to handle almost any situation.  She is extremely athletic and proficient in a great number of activities and skills including [[car racing]], [[hang gliding]], [[parachuting]], [[helicopter pilot]]ing, [[motorcycling|motorcycle riding]], [[roller skating]], [[skateboarding]], martial arts, [[electronics]], [[pistol shooting|handguns]] and [[scuba diving]].  She is a skilled actress and is able to disguise her appearance effortlessly.  She is also fluent in a number of languages including English, French and German; she can also read lips accurately.\n:Rui acts as the [[father figure|mother figure]] for her sisters and is very protective of them.  She is the only sister who has any lasting memory of their parents.\n;{{nihongo|Ai Kisugi|\u6765\u751f \u611b|Kisugi Ai|Age 16}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chika Sakamoto]]|Megan Shipman (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')}} <ref>https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html</ref>\n:Ai is the third protagonist of the series.  As baby sister of the trio, Ai has a spunky, [[tomboy]]ish personality and [[Social behavior|demeanor]], and has a genius-level [[I.Q.]] and is particularly adept in [[mechanics]], [[computer programming]] and engineering.  She has built a wide array of [[gadgets]] to help her sisters in their heists.  A typical teenager, she seems to be preoccupied a lot and dreams of falling in love.  Being a high school girl, she also has a pet [[tabby]] [[kitten]] called \"Tiger\".\n:While not as skilled as her sisters, Ai has none-the-less mastered a number of skills and is regularly the one who operates the [[crime scene getaway|get-away vehicles]] for the heists, including [[helicopter]]s, [[gyrocopter]]s, trucks, [[motorcycles]], cars and mini-planes.  Her greatest weakness lies in the fact she is physically the weakest of the three siblings (evident in the anime when she tried to [[suplex]] a [[wrestler]], only to have the maneuver backfire on her), but in exchange, she is also the most agile. \n;{{nihongo|Toshio Utsumi|\u5185\u6d77 \u4fca\u592b|Utsumi Toshio|Age 24}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yoshito Yasuhara]]}}\n:The male protagonist of the series, Toshio is the Hitomi's [[childhood sweetheart|high school sweetheart]].  Toshio always dreamed of being a police detective even when in high school, and upon graduation from Academy was assigned to the {{nihongo|Inunaki|\u72ac\u9cf4||\"Crying Dog\"}} District Police Station in the heart of Tokyo.  While Toshio has wanted to marry Hitomi, he has vowed not to until he has captured the Cat's Eye (he has, however, made the first step and proposed to her).\n:While a bit clumsy, very gullible, unlucky and not very good at finding clues, his dogged determination and unyielding persistence has impressed his supervisors.  He is, however, very stubborn and gets into verbal fights with his Chief constantly.  Toshio doesn't carry a gun and prefers to use his wits and fists to contend with criminals.  He has a weakness for beautiful women (especially blondes) and constantly makes Hitomi jealous.\n;{{nihongo|Boss|\u8ab2\u9577|Kacho}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kenji Utsumi]]}}\n:Toshio's demanding Section Chief, who oversees the Detective's Division of the Inunaki Precinct.  Nothing really is known about him, even his full name is never disclosed.  He is constantly at odds with Toshio over his handling of the Cat's Eye investigation, and scolds Toshio at every opportunity.\n;{{nihongo|Mitsuko Asatani|\u6d45\u8c37 \u5149\u5b50|Asatani Mitsuko|Age 24}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yoshiko Sakakibara]]}}\n:A special investigator sent in from Tokyo Police HQ to assist in the Cat's Eye investigations.  Asatani has a very shrewd intellect and has a very cunning personality, and is considered an elite officer of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.  She is an expert [[markswoman]] (won the All-Japan Air Pistol Championships) and is proficient in several martial art forms, she's a 4th-degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in karate and 2nd degree black belt in judo, making her more than a match for Hitomi.  She is also quite a beauty, even being crowned a beauty queen during one of the Cat's Eye cases.  She is one of the first person to suspect Hitomi as the true identity of Cat's Eye, but is never able to find definitive proof.  Her main weakness is that she must wear [[corrective lens|prescription glasses]] all the time, as she is practically blind without them.\n:While never really elaborated in the TV series, in the manga she is said to have a secret crush on Toshio, much to the chagrin of Hitomi.\n;{{nihongo|Michael Heinz|\u30df\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30f3\u30c4}}\n:An artistic [[child prodigy|wunderkind]] in Germany during the 1930s, Heinz was so gifted that by age 10 he already began composing the beginnings of his impressive art collection, which contains not only elaborate paintings and lithographs but also one-of-a-kind jewelry, sculptures and metal works.  Heinz's was even able to create exquisite musical instruments.  As such Heinz's works were highly sought among art collectors and galleries and many would pay exorbitant amounts to own one of his works.\n:When the [[Nazi party]] began taking over Germany, Heinz fled the country for fear of [[degenerate art|political/artistic suppression]].  Traveling around the world, he eventually settled down in Japan, where he met and married a young Japanese woman.  After the birth of their third daughter, Heinz travelled to the United States, where he disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  His vast and priceless collection of art works were soon auctioned off and dispersed to [[art dealer]]s around the world.  Eventually, many pieces found their way to Japan in the hands of various private deals (many with criminal ties).  In subsequent years, the collection were stolen piece by piece, regardless of heavy security, by a trio of thieves calling themselves \"Cat's Eye\", who were actually Heinz's grown-up daughters seeking clues to his whereabouts and hoping to get his attention to get him out of hiding.\n:Rui, Hitomi and Ai find that their father is in the U.S. and they go there to track him down.  It is eventually revealed that Michael was actually betrayed and forced into exile by his jealous twin brother Cranaff (\u30af\u30e9\u30ca\u30c3\u30d5), who then stole Michael's identity for profit with the syndicate.  The revelation ends the sisters' hope of finding their father through recollecting his art work, and the Cat's Eye cease operations afterwards.\n;{{nihongo|Sadatsugu Nagaishi|\u6c38\u77f3 \u5b9a\u55e3|Nagaishi Sadatsugu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Tamio \u014cki]]}}\n:Trusted friend and confidant to the three sisters, a very good friend of Heinz and his wife.  Nagaishi provides detailed information for Cat's Eye's heists and also helps them acquire any hardware and/or other sophisticated equipment that they may need that Ai cannot provide.  His background is a mystery but he may have been a member of the Armed Forces as he has some military expertise.\n;{{nihongo|Kazumi|\u548c\u7f8e}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chiyoko Kawashima]]}}\n:A girl from Ai's school who took a picture of Hitomi while shooting photographs of the moon with a [[telelens]].  She later boasted to one of her friends that she had taken pictures of Cat's Eye, sending Ai (who overheard the conversation) panicking.  Kasumi became determined to reveal Cat's Eye's true nature and planned to go to the place Cat's Eye's next target with her camera.  She managed to get a good look at the backside of Cat's Eye and thought that Hitomi fits that picture very well, and became only more convinced when she sees Hitomi playing around with some punks in the park.  Asatani has noticed this too and takes Kazumi into her confidence.  With a story about her dad being away (that it is unsafe for a young girl to be alone at home), Kazumi infiltrates into the Kisugi's home and asks Ai to let her stay the night.  However, the Kisugi sisters managed to cunningly circumvent Kazumi's suspicion by appearing that Hitomi was still at home during the Cat's Eye mission.\n\n== ''City Hunter'' Connection ==\nIn contrast to ''[[Angel Heart (manga)|Angel Heart]]''\n(which setting in alternate universe despite sharing ''City Hunter'' characters) Both ''Cat's Eye'' and ''City Hunter'' series are set in same universe. The titular ''City Hunter'' character, Ryo Saeba has been aquintanced with them. He also has rivaly with them due the he was helping police capture Cat's Eye, Which ended up in hilariously failure. Ryo often flirting Rui, the eldest Kisugi daughter and has no interest toward Hitomi and Ai (most likely Ryo aware Hitomi fell in love with Toshio and Ai was too young for him). But she has no interest to him, which she often reject him ranging politely to harsh (Most likely she aware Ryo has strong feeling toward Kaori Makimura, his current partner). Despite their rivalry, they have great teamwork involved fighting against criminal. This was evident in ''City Hunter the Movie: Shinjuku'' ''Private Eyes'' when Ryo has trouble defeat his enemy. The sister came to the rescue.

The sisters lead a [[secret identity|double life]] as a trio of highly skilled [[art thieves]], stealing works of art which primarily belonged to their long-missing father, Michael Heinz, who was a famous [[art collector]] during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]].  Hitomi's [[fianc\u00e9]] is Toshio Utsumi, a clumsy young police officer who is investigating the Cat's Eye case.  Despite being a frequent visitor to the caf\u00e9 he is unaware of the double life of the girls.  Hitomi regularly informs the police in advance about her next job using a signature \"Cat's Eye\" [[calling card (crime)|calling card]], and then uses Toshio's research about the security surrounding the target to help plan the job.\n\nAt the end of the series, Heinz leaves a note for his daughters stating that he cannot reveal himself yet because the [[mafia]] may kill him, but he may appear in five years' time.  However, the \"Heinz\" turns out to be the sisters' treacherous uncle Cranaff, who betrayed Michael years earlier.  After losing a final bet to the Cat's Eye, Cranaff decides to [[atonement|atone]] for his [[sin]] by setting fire to the museum, killing himself.  Hitomi eventually admits to Toshio that she is part of Cat's Eye and flees before he can arrest her.  Toshio vows to track her down, attempting to \"arrest\" Hitomi at the airport with a wedding ring.  He resigns from the police force and travels to America to find Hitomi, but finds that she has [[amnesia|lost her memory]] due to [[viral meningitis]].  Toshio spends time with her until her memories come back, and the two rekindle their relationship.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Hitomi Kisugi|\u6765\u751f \u77b3|Kisugi Hitomi|Age 24}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Keiko Toda]]|[[Alexis Tipton]] (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')}} <ref>https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html</ref>\n:Hitomi is the main [[protagonist]] of the series.  Second daughter of Michael Heinz, Hitomi is usually the one who actually commits the [[wikt:heist|heist]]s, and is hence uniquely referred to as ''the'' Cat's Eye.  Like Rui, she is an accomplished athlete and well versed in a number of disciplines and skills ranging from [[horseback riding]] to [[safe cracking]].  She is a skilled gymnast and is able to perform complex [[acrobatic]] moves with ease and grace.  She is able to escape most restraints and [[handcuffs]] with minimal effort, and it is inferred that she is [[ambidextrous]] as well as [[double jointed]].  She is a skilled martial artist with proficiency in a number of disciplines, most notably [[judo]], [[boxing]] and [[karate]], and also has degrees in [[kendo]] and [[aikido]].  Hitomi is very charming, clever, sweet, sisterly, loyal, cunning, flirtatious, caring and kind-hearted.\n:Like Rui, Hitomi is also able to disguise her appearance effortlessly and can speak several other languages.\n;{{nihongo|Rui Kisugi|\u6765\u751f \u6cea|Kisugi Rui|Age 27}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Toshiko Fujita]], [[Keiko Toda]] (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')|Dawn M. Bennett (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')}} <ref>https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html</ref>\n:Rui is the second protagonist of the series.  Hitomi's elegant and fashionable older sister, Rui is the leader and brain of the \u201cCat's Eye\u201d group and the one who usually outlines strategies and plans the heists.  With model good looks, worldly sophistication, and a razor-sharp intelligence she is able to handle almost any situation.  She is extremely athletic and proficient in a great number of activities and skills including [[car racing]], [[hang gliding]], [[parachuting]], [[helicopter pilot]]ing, [[motorcycling|motorcycle riding]], [[roller skating]], [[skateboarding]], martial arts, [[electronics]], [[pistol shooting|handguns]] and [[scuba diving]].  She is a skilled actress and is able to disguise her appearance effortlessly.  She is also fluent in a number of languages including English, French and German; she can also read lips accurately.\n:Rui acts as the [[father figure|mother figure]] for her sisters and is very protective of them.  She is the only sister who has any lasting memory of their parents.\n;{{nihongo|Ai Kisugi|\u6765\u751f \u611b|Kisugi Ai|Age 16}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chika Sakamoto]]|Megan Shipman (''[[City Hunter]]: Shinjuku Private Eyes'')}} <ref>https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html</ref>\n:Ai is the third protagonist of the series.  As baby sister of the trio, Ai has a spunky, [[tomboy]]ish personality and [[Social behavior|demeanor]], and has a genius-level [[I.Q.]] and is particularly adept in [[mechanics]], [[computer programming]] and engineering.  She has built a wide array of [[gadgets]] to help her sisters in their heists.  A typical teenager, she seems to be preoccupied a lot and dreams of falling in love.  Being a high school girl, she also has a pet [[tabby]] [[kitten]] called \"Tiger\".\n:While not as skilled as her sisters, Ai has none-the-less mastered a number of skills and is regularly the one who operates the [[crime scene getaway|get-away vehicles]] for the heists, including [[helicopter]]s, [[gyrocopter]]s, trucks, [[motorcycles]], cars and mini-planes.  Her greatest weakness lies in the fact she is physically the weakest of the three siblings (evident in the anime when she tried to [[suplex]] a [[wrestler]], only to have the maneuver backfire on her), but in exchange, she is also the most agile. \n;{{nihongo|Toshio Utsumi|\u5185\u6d77 \u4fca\u592b|Utsumi Toshio|Age 24}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yoshito Yasuhara]]}}\n:The male protagonist of the series, Toshio is the Hitomi's [[childhood sweetheart|high school sweetheart]].  Toshio always dreamed of being a police detective even when in high school, and upon graduation from Academy was assigned to the {{nihongo|Inunaki|\u72ac\u9cf4||\"Crying Dog\"}} District Police Station in the heart of Tokyo.  While Toshio has wanted to marry Hitomi, he has vowed not to until he has captured the Cat's Eye (he has, however, made the first step and proposed to her).\n:While a bit clumsy, very gullible, unlucky and not very good at finding clues, his dogged determination and unyielding persistence has impressed his supervisors.  He is, however, very stubborn and gets into verbal fights with his Chief constantly.  Toshio doesn't carry a gun and prefers to use his wits and fists to contend with criminals.  He has a weakness for beautiful women (especially blondes) and constantly makes Hitomi jealous.\n;{{nihongo|Boss|\u8ab2\u9577|Kacho}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kenji Utsumi]]}}\n:Toshio's demanding Section Chief, who oversees the Detective's Division of the Inunaki Precinct.  Nothing really is known about him, even his full name is never disclosed.  He is constantly at odds with Toshio over his handling of the Cat's Eye investigation, and scolds Toshio at every opportunity.\n;{{nihongo|Mitsuko Asatani|\u6d45\u8c37 \u5149\u5b50|Asatani Mitsuko|Age 24}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yoshiko Sakakibara]]}}\n:A special investigator sent in from Tokyo Police HQ to assist in the Cat's Eye investigations.  Asatani has a very shrewd intellect and has a very cunning personality, and is considered an elite officer of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.  She is an expert [[markswoman]] (won the All-Japan Air Pistol Championships) and is proficient in several martial art forms, she's a 4th-degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in karate and 2nd degree black belt in judo, making her more than a match for Hitomi.  She is also quite a beauty, even being crowned a beauty queen during one of the Cat's Eye cases.  She is one of the first person to suspect Hitomi as the true identity of Cat's Eye, but is never able to find definitive proof.  Her main weakness is that she must wear [[corrective lens|prescription glasses]] all the time, as she is practically blind without them.\n:While never really elaborated in the TV series, in the manga she is said to have a secret crush on Toshio, much to the chagrin of Hitomi.\n;{{nihongo|Michael Heinz|\u30df\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30f3\u30c4}}\n:An artistic [[child prodigy|wunderkind]] in Germany during the 1930s, Heinz was so gifted that by age 10 he already began composing the beginnings of his impressive art collection, which contains not only elaborate paintings and lithographs but also one-of-a-kind jewelry, sculptures and metal works.  Heinz's was even able to create exquisite musical instruments.  As such Heinz's works were highly sought among art collectors and galleries and many would pay exorbitant amounts to own one of his works.\n:When the [[Nazi party]] began taking over Germany, Heinz fled the country for fear of [[degenerate art|political/artistic suppression]].  Traveling around the world, he eventually settled down in Japan, where he met and married a young Japanese woman.  After the birth of their third daughter, Heinz travelled to the United States, where he disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  His vast and priceless collection of art works were soon auctioned off and dispersed to [[art dealer]]s around the world.  Eventually, many pieces found their way to Japan in the hands of various private deals (many with criminal ties).  In subsequent years, the collection were stolen piece by piece, regardless of heavy security, by a trio of thieves calling themselves \"Cat's Eye\", who were actually Heinz's grown-up daughters seeking clues to his whereabouts and hoping to get his attention to get him out of hiding.\n:Rui, Hitomi and Ai find that their father is in the U.S. and they go there to track him down.  It is eventually revealed that Michael was actually betrayed and forced into exile by his jealous twin brother Cranaff (\u30af\u30e9\u30ca\u30c3\u30d5), who then stole Michael's identity for profit with the syndicate.  The revelation ends the sisters' hope of finding their father through recollecting his art work, and the Cat's Eye cease operations afterwards.\n;{{nihongo|Sadatsugu Nagaishi|\u6c38\u77f3 \u5b9a\u55e3|Nagaishi Sadatsugu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Tamio \u014cki]]}}\n:Trusted friend and confidant to the three sisters, a very good friend of Heinz and his wife.  Nagaishi provides detailed information for Cat's Eye's heists and also helps them acquire any hardware and/or other sophisticated equipment that they may need that Ai cannot provide.  His background is a mystery but he may have been a member of the Armed Forces as he has some military expertise.\n;{{nihongo|Kazumi|\u548c\u7f8e}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chiyoko Kawashima]]}}\n:A girl from Ai's school who took a picture of Hitomi while shooting photographs of the moon with a [[telelens]].  She later boasted to one of her friends that she had taken pictures of Cat's Eye, sending Ai (who overheard the conversation) panicking.  Kasumi became determined to reveal Cat's Eye's true nature and planned to go to the place Cat's Eye's next target with her camera.  She managed to get a good look at the backside of Cat's Eye and thought that Hitomi fits that picture very well, and became only more convinced when she sees Hitomi playing around with some punks in the park.  Asatani has noticed this too and takes Kazumi into her confidence.  With a story about her dad being away (that it is unsafe for a young girl to be alone at home), Kazumi infiltrates into the Kisugi's home and asks Ai to let her stay the night.  However, the Kisugi sisters managed to cunningly circumvent Kazumi's suspicion by appearing that Hitomi was still at home during the Cat's Eye mission.\n\n== ''City Hunter'' Connection ==\nIn contrast to ''[[Angel Heart (manga)|Angel Heart]]''\n(which setting in alternate universe despite sharing ''City Hunter'' characters) Both ''Cat's Eye'' and ''City Hunter'' series are set in same universe. The titular ''City Hunter'' character, Ryo Saeba has been aquintanced with them. He also has rivaly with them due the he was helping police capture Cat's Eye, Which ended up in hilariously failure. Ryo often flirting Rui, the eldest Kisugi daughter and has no interest toward Hitomi and Ai (most likely Ryo aware Hitomi fell in love with Toshio and Ai was too young for him). But she has no interest to him, which she often reject him ranging politely to harsh (Most likely she aware Ryo has strong feeling toward Kaori Makimura, his current partner). Despite their rivarly, they have great teamwork involved fighting against criminal. This was evident in ''City Hunter the Movie: Shinjuku'' ''Private Eyes'' when Ryo has trouble defeat his enemy. The sister came to the rescue. Which they quickly manage defeat their enemy.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Cat's Eye chapters}}\n[[Tsukasa Hojo]]'s ''Cat's Eye'' was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1981 to 1985, with the chapters collected into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' by [[Shueisha]].
