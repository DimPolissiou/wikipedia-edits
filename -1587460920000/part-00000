Although pulp and paper manufacturing requires large amounts of energy, a portion of it comes from burning wood residue.]]\nThe '''environmental impact of paper''' is significant, which has led to changes in [[paper industry|industry]] and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the [[printing press]] and the highly mechanized [[forest harvester|harvesting of wood]], [[disposable]] paper became a relatively cheap commodity, which led to a high level of consumption and [[waste]]. The rise in global environmental issues such as air and water pollution, climate change, overflowing landfills and [[clearcutting]] have all lead to increased government regulations. There is now a trend towards [[sustainability]] in the [[pulp and paper industry]] as it moves to reduce clear cutting, water use, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel consumption and clean up its impacts on local water supplies and air pollution.\n\nAccording to a Canadian citizen's organization, \"People need paper products and we need sustainable, environmentally safe production.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfu.org/cacw/home.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101205211/http://www.rfu.org/cacw/home.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-01-01|title=Clean Air - Clean Water - Pulp Info Centre|publisher=Reach for Unbleached Foundation, Comox, BC|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>\n\nEnvironmental product declarations or product scorecards are available to collect and evaluate the environmental and social performance of paper products, such as the Paper Calculator,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.papercalculator.org|title=Paper Calculator|date=July 30, 2019|website=Environmental Paper Network Paper Calculator}}</ref> Environmental Paper Assessment Tool (EPAT),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epat.org|title=EPAT - Welcome|website=Epat.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> or Paper Profile.<ref>Paper Profile, 2008.

Mills are also required to conduct environmental effects monitoring to determine the impact of their effluents on receiving waters and investigate the causes of, and solutions for, environmental effects associated with mill effluent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-269/|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations|website=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n# Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans Regulations: issued under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and applies to polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans in mill effluents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-267/|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans Regulations|website=Laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n# Pulp and Paper Mill Defoamer and Wood Chip Regulation: regulates use of defoamers containing dibenzofuran or dibenzo-para-dioxin at pulp and paper mills using a chlorine bleaching process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-268/|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Pulp and Paper Mill Defoamer and Wood Chip Regulations|website=Laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are also regulations in place to control the releases of contaminants into the air, including particulate matter and ground-level ozone and these include the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards Regulations. At the federal level,  Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has a legislated, publicly accessible inventory of pollutant releases to air, water and land, as well as disposals and recycling, namely the National Pollutant Release Inventory, which companies are required to report each year. Operators of facilities that meet the reporting criteria are required to report facility greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to ECCC each year.\n\nSome provinces have their own regulatory frameworks to manage air quality such as the Ontario provincial standards, as well as to control GHG emissions including the British Columbia Carbon Tax, Alberta Climate Leadership Plan, and the Ontario and Quebec Cap and Trade Systems.\n\nIn Canada, where 94% of the country's forests are on public land, a framework of federal, provincial and territorial laws, regulations and policies enforces and guides sustainable forest management practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/canada/laws/17497|title=Canada's forest laws|website=Nrcan.gc.ca|accessdate=16 August 2018|date=2015-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==== International ====\n\u201cThe Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines are technical reference documents with general and industry specific examples of Good International Industry Practice (GIIP).\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental, Health, and Safety General Guidelines|url=http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/554e8d80488658e4b76af76a6515bb18/Final+-+General+EHS+Guidelines.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|website=World Bank Group|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\nIn simpler terms, the EHS is what helps develop the federal regulations on industries and companies that require factories that have the potential to cause a great amount of harm to society and the environment. These Guidelines for the [[environment, health and safety]] list out the specific rules for the paper mill industries that explains what they need to follow in order to limit the pollution that is consequently distributed and by the mills.\n\n===Mechanical pulp mills===\n{{Main|Pulp mill#The mill|Bleaching of wood pulp#Bleaching mechanical pulps|l1=Pulp mill|l2=Bleaching mechanical pulps}}\n[[Wood pulp]] produced primarily by grinding wood is known as \"mechanical pulp\" and is used mainly for [[newsprint]]. These mechanical processes use fewer chemicals than either kraft or sulfite mills. The primary source of pollution from these mills is organic material such as resin acids released from the wood when it is processed. Mechanical wood pulp is \"[[Bleaching of wood pulp#Bleaching mechanical pulps|brightened]],\" as opposed to bleached, using less toxic chemicals than are needed for chemical pulps.\n\n==Inks==\nThree main issues with the environmental impact of printing [[ink]]s is the use of [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and non-renewable oils. Standards for the amount of heavy metals in ink have been set by some regulatory bodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508062911/http://cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |archivedate=2007-05-08 }}</ref> There is a trend toward using [[vegetable oil]]s rather than [[petroleum oil]]s in recent years due to a demand for better [[sustainability]].\n\n[[Deinking]] recycled paper pulp results in a waste slurry which may go to [[landfill]].

It is typically an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men.

Neha at one point loses sight of what is real and what is her nightmare. A curse of the past triggers her into meltdown and another miscarriage. What we don't know is whether the child- Ansh was involved in making that happen.\n\n====Story 3 - directed by ''[[Dibakar Banerjee]]''====\nA man (Sukant Goel) arrives in a small town, Bees-ghara to find it empty, except for a boy and girl. He's told that everyone has been eaten<ref name=\":1\" /> by the girl's father, who is the councilman of Sau-ghara, the big town. At first, the man refuses to believe the, and when he tries to go out, is met with a zombie woman who attacks him. The boy rescues him, and back in the safe house, he decides to save the children and alert the local authorities. When he gets out and enters a school, he sees the principal behaving strangely. The principal suddenly runs away. The children explain that some people, in order to save themselves from getting eaten, started eating others too as the creatures do not eat those who also eat human flesh. As the man watches, the school principal convulses on the ground. The girl's father, who resembles a hairy bear-like creature enters their room. The creature, who has poor vision, is unable to detect the presence of the man and the children until the girl, overcome with love for her father, goes near him, only to be killed and eaten by him. The other two, stunned, don't move for a day, and the monster leaves. The boy has an idea that they take the remains of the girl's body and cover their faces with it so that the zombies will believe that they too are eaters and let them go. The entire place is under surveillance by the girl's father and upon seeing the pair, he checks them personally. He grows suspicious of the boy, who in reaction, eats some of the flesh of the girl. The monster turns to the man, who holds himself, but gets scared and starts running, resulting in him being chased by the zombies. On the way, he falls into a trap. He is thrown the girl's hand, so that he can demonstrate he is one of the creatures .The man refuses to do so, and screams as the girl's father pounces on him, only to wake up from what is supposedly a dream. The man is then confused as he wakes up in the same trap he fell into, and runs towards Bees-ghara. Finding the place deserted and burning, he assumes the worst and cries that he failed to save the children. At the same time, a car comes, full of people who resembled the earlier zombies.The man is taken by them and they tell him that they are people of Sau-ghara and that nobody lives in Bees-ghara after they burned it down because it was a very inferior place.\n\n==== Story 4 - directed by ''[[Karan Johar]]'' ====\nIra ([[Mrunal Thakur]]) agrees to have an arranged marriage with the handsome and wealthy Dhruv ([[Avinash Tiwary]]) who dwells in a house his grandmother built. On the first night after her wedding, she sees her husband seemingly talking to the grandmother who died 20 years ago. Each night after that, the grandmother comes to bid good night to Dhruv, who seems to be the only one who can see her.\n\nIn spite of being an adult, he enjoys playing peek-a-boo with the dead grandmother. Ira questions the maid Shanti (Heeba Shah), and learns that when Dhruv was playing peek-a-boo with her, he accidentally pushed her down the stairs. The grandmother was severely incapacitated and in terrible pain. Despite this, she would make it a point to visit Dhruv each night to wish him a good night. The conversation ends before Ira can learn the circumstances of the grandmother's passing. One night Ira gets tired of Dhruv's attachment to his dead grandmother and storms into her room, still preserved as a shrine her, and screams at the grandmother to leave them alone. The next day, at breakfast, Shanti helps Ira stir her oatmeal. Midway through breakfast, Ira starts having severe stomach cramps and is helped to her bed by Shanti. As Ira lies writhing in pain, Shanti completes their earlier conversation, telling Ira that the grandmother had begged Shanti to put an end to her pain. Being the obedient maid that she is, she mixed castor seeds into her breakfast; thereby, poisoning her to death.\n\nThe viewer is led to understand that Shanti did the same for Ira. Ira wakes up into a brightly lit room and sees the grandmother hovering over her. Confused, Ira asks how it is that she can now see her. She lets Ira know that this is because Ira is now in her world, implying that Ira is dead. Ira then turns her head to see other human forms while the grandmother tells her that those are the others who, like Ira, did not believe in her presence.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n'''Zoya Akhtar's segment'''\n*[[Janhvi Kapoor]] as Sameera\n*[[Surekha Sikri]] as Mrs. Malik\n*[[Vijay Varma]] as Guddu\n\n'''Anurag Kashyap's segment'''\n*[[Sobhita Dhulipala]] as Neha\n*Sagar Arya as Neha's husband\n*Zachary Braz as Ansh\n*Pavail Gulati as Ansh's father\n\n'''Dibakar Banerjee's segment'''\n*Sukant Goel as Visitor\n*Aditya Shetty as Little Boy\n*Eva Ameet Pardeshi as Little Girl\n*[[Gulshan Devaiah]] as girl's Daddy\n\n'''Karan Johar's segment'''\n*[[Mrunal Thakur]] as Ira\n*[[Avinash Tiwary]] as Dhruv\n*[[Jyoti Subhash]] as Dhruv's Granny\n*[[Kitu Gidwani]] as Dhruv's Mother\n*Sumit Tandon as Dhruv's Father\n*Namrata Chopra as Ira's Mother\n*Kusha Kapila as Misha\n*Shataf Figar as Ira's Father\n*Heeba N Shah as Shanti\n\n== Production ==\nIn April 2019, it was announced that [[Anurag Kashyap]], [[Zoya Akhtar]], [[Dibakar Banerjee]], and [[Karan Johar]] will be reuniting again after ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' and ''[[Lust Stories]]'' for a horror film for [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/spine-chilling-netflixs-ghost-stories-karan-johar-sanaullah-ansari-dibakar-banerjee-anurag-kashyap-to-reunite/1548761/ |title=Spine chilling!

Later, it is found out that the son never turned up and she died due to starvation three days back.\n\n==== Story 2 - directed by ''[[Anurag Kashyap]]'' ====\nSet in what feels like 90's Britain with a heavily desaturated look that borders on monochrome, the story revolves around a paranoid, pregnant woman Neha ([[Sobhita Dhulipala]]) who babysits her late sister's kid, Ansh (Zachary Braz).<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/reviews/ghost-stories-netflix-review-2020-movie-dibakar-banerjee-janhvi-kapoor-karan-johar-2157853|title=Dibakar Banerjee Can\u2019t Save Netflix\u2019s Incorrectly Titled Ghost Stories|last=Arora|first=Akhil|website=NDTV Gadgets 360|language=en|accessdate=2020-01-02}}</ref> The obsessive affection of a kid and paranoia of a childless young woman assumes terrifying proportions. Neha at one point loses sight of what is real and what is her nightmare. A curse of the past triggers her into meltdown and another miscarriage. What we don't know is whether the child- Ansh was involved in making that happen.\n\n====Story 3 - directed by ''[[Dibakar Banerjee]]''====\nA man (Sukant Goel) arrives in a small town, Bees-ghara to find it empty, except for a boy and girl. He's told that everyone has been eaten<ref name=\":1\" /> by the girl's father, who is the councilman of Sau-ghara, the big town. At first, the man refuses to believe the, and when he tries to go out, is met with a zombie woman who attacks him. The boy rescues him, and back in the safe house, he decides to save the children and alert the local authorities. When he gets out and enters a school, he sees the principal behaving strangely. The principal suddenly runs away. The children explain that some people, in order to save themselves from getting eaten, started eating others too as the creatures do not eat those who also eat human flesh. As the man watches, the school principal convulses on the ground. The girl's father, who resembles a hairy bear-like creature enters their room. The creature, who has poor vision, is unable to detect the presence of the man and the children until the girl, overcome with love for her father, goes near him, only to be killed and eaten by him. The other two, stunned, don't move for a day, and the monster leaves. The boy has an idea that they take the remains of the girl's body and cover their faces with it so that the zombies will believe that they too are eaters and let them go. The entire place is under surveillance by the girl's father and upon seeing the pair, he checks them personally. He grows suspicious of the boy, who in reaction, eats some of the flesh of the girl. The monster turns to the man, who holds himself, but gets scared and starts running, resulting in him being chased by the zombies. On the way, he falls into a trap. He is thrown the girl's hand, so that he can demonstrate he is one of the creatures .The man refuses to do so, and screams as the girl's father pounces on him, only to wake up from what is supposedly a dream. The man is then confused as he wakes up in the same trap he fell into, and runs towards Bees-ghara. Finding the place deserted and burning, he assumes the worst and cries that he failed to save the children. At the same time, a car comes, full of people who resembled the earlier zombies.The man is taken by them and they tell him that they are people of Sau-ghara and that nobody lives in Bees-ghara after they burned it down because it was a very inferior place.\n\n==== Story 4 - directed by ''[[Karan Johar]]'' ====\nIra ([[Mrunal Thakur]]) agrees to have an arranged marriage with the handsome and wealthy Dhruv ([[Avinash Tiwary]]) who dwells in a house his grandmother built. On the first night after her wedding, she sees her husband seemingly talking to the grandmother who died 20 years ago. Each night after that, the grandmother comes to bid good night to Dhruv, who seems to be the only one who can see her.\n\nIn spite of being an adult, he enjoys playing peek-a-boo with the dead grandmother. Ira questions the maid Shanti (Heeba Shah), and learns that when Dhruv was playing peek-a-boo with her, he accidentally pushed her down the stairs. The grandmother was severely incapacitated and in terrible pain. Despite this, she would make it a point to visit Dhruv each night to wish him a good night. The conversation ends before Ira can learn the circumstances of the grandmother's passing. One night Ira gets tired of Dhruv's attachment to his dead grandmother and storms into her room, still preserved as a shrine her, and screams at the grandmother to leave them alone. The next day, at breakfast, Shanti helps Ira stir her oatmeal. Midway through breakfast, Ira starts having severe stomach cramps and is helped to her bed by Shanti. As Ira lies writhing in pain, Shanti completes their earlier conversation, telling Ira that the grandmother had begged Shanti to put an end to her pain. Being the obedient maid that she is, she mixed castor seeds into her breakfast; thereby, poisoning her to death.\n\nThe viewer is led to understand that Shanti did the same for Ira. Ira wakes up into a brightly lit room and sees the grandmother hovering over her. Confused, Ira asks how it is that she can now see her. She lets Ira know that this is because Ira is now in her world, implying that Ira is dead. Ira then turns her head to see other human forms while the grandmother tells her that those are the others who, like Ira, did not believe in her presence.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n'''Zoya Akhtar's segment'''\n*[[Janhvi Kapoor]] as Sameera\n*[[Surekha Sikri]] as Mrs. Malik\n*[[Vijay Varma]] as Guddu\n\n'''Anurag Kashyap's segment'''\n*[[Sobhita Dhulipala]] as Neha\n*Sagar Arya as Neha's husband\n*Zachary Braz as Ansh\n*Pavail Gulati as Ansh's father\n\n'''Dibakar Banerjee's segment'''\n*Sukant Goel as Visitor\n*Aditya Shetty as Little Boy\n*Eva Ameet Pardeshi as Little Girl\n*[[Gulshan Devaiah]] as girl's Daddy\n\n'''Karan Johar's segment'''\n*[[Mrunal Thakur]] as Ira\n*[[Avinash Tiwary]] as Dhruv\n*[[Jyoti Subhash]] as Dhruv's Granny\n*[[Kitu Gidwani]] as Dhruv's Mother\n*Sumit Tandon as Dhruv's Father\n*Namrata Chopra as Ira's Mother\n*Kusha Kapila as Misha\n*Shataf Figar as Ira's Father\n*Heeba N Shah as Shanti\n\n== Production ==\nIn April 2019, it was announced that [[Anurag Kashyap]], [[Zoya Akhtar]], [[Dibakar Banerjee]], and [[Karan Johar]] will be reuniting again after ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' and ''[[Lust Stories]]'' for a horror film for [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/spine-chilling-netflixs-ghost-stories-karan-johar-sanaullah-ansari-dibakar-banerjee-anurag-kashyap-to-reunite/1548761/ |title=Spine chilling!
