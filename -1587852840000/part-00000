After a slow start under the direction of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]], at the urging of British scientists and American administrators, the program was put under the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], and in 1942 it was officially transferred under the auspices of the [[United States Army]] and became known as the [[Manhattan Project]], an American, British and Canadian joint venture. Under the direction of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Leslie Groves]], over thirty different sites were constructed for the research, production, and testing of components related to bomb-making. These included the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], under the direction of physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]], the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] [[plutonium]] production facility in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and the [[Y-12 National Security Complex]] in [[Tennessee]].\n\nBy investing heavily in breeding plutonium in early [[nuclear reactor]]s and in the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion enrichment processes for the production of [[uranium-235]], the United States was able to develop three usable weapons by mid-1945. The [[Trinity test]] was a plutonium [[Nuclear weapon design|implosion-design]] weapon tested on 16 July 1945, with around a 20 [[kiloton]] yield.\n\nFaced with a planned [[Operation Olympic|invasion of the Japanese home islands]] scheduled to begin on 1 November 1945 and with Japan not surrendering, President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered the atomic raids on Japan. On 6 August 1945, the U.S. detonated a uranium-[[Nuclear weapons design|gun design]] bomb, [[Little Boy]], over the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] with an energy of about 15 kilotons of TNT, killing approximately 70,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese [[combatant]]s and 20,000 Korean [[Unfree labour|slave laborers]], and destroying nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]] [[headquarters]]). Three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. attacked [[Nagasaki]] using a plutonium implosion-design bomb, [[Fat Man]], with the explosion equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200\u201328,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers & Artists Against Nuclear Energy & Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22\u201329 |date=1 May 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1947, the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (known as the McMahon Act) took effect, and the Manhattan Project was officially turned over to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hewlett |first=Richard G. |authorlink=Richard G.

Many former nuclear facilities were shut down, and their sites became targets of extensive environmental remediation. Efforts were redirected from weapons production to [[stockpile stewardship]], attempting to predict the behavior of aging weapons without using full-scale nuclear testing. Increased funding was also put into anti-[[nuclear proliferation]] programs, such as helping the states of the former Soviet Union to eliminate their former nuclear sites and to assist Russia in their efforts to inventory and secure their inherited nuclear stockpile. By February 2006, over $1.2 billion had been paid under the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] of 1990 to U.S. citizens exposed to nuclear hazards as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons program, and by 1998 at least $759 million had been paid to the Marshall Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing, and over $15 million was paid to the [[Politics of Japan|Japanese government]] following the exposure of its citizens and food supply to [[nuclear fallout]] from the 1954 [[Bravo test|\"Bravo\" test]].<ref name=\"Brookings\"/><ref name=\"usdoj\" /> In 1998, the country spent an estimated total of $35.1 billion on its nuclear weapons and weapons-related programs.<ref name=\"Brookings\"/>\n[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|250px|Large stockpile with global range (dark blue)]]\nIn the 2013 book ''Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters'' (Oxford), [[Kate Brown (professor)|Kate Brown]] explores the health of affected citizens in the United States, and the \"slow-motion disasters\" that still threaten the environments where the plants are located. According to Brown, the plants at Hanford, over a period of four decades, released millions of curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment.<ref name=katebr/> Brown says that most of this [[radioactive contamination]] over the years at Hanford were part of normal operations, but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret, as the pollution continued unabated. Even today, as pollution threats to health and the environment persist, the government keeps knowledge about the associated risks from the public.<ref name=katebr/>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[George W. Bush]], and especially after the 11 September [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks]] of 2001, rumors circulated in major news sources that the U.S. was considering designing new nuclear weapons ([[Nuclear bunker buster|\"bunker-busting nukes\"]]) and resuming nuclear testing for reasons of stockpile stewardship. Republicans argued that small nuclear weapons appear more likely to be used than large nuclear weapons, and thus small nuclear weapons pose a more credible threat that has more of a deterrent effect against hostile behavior. Democrats counterargued that allowing the weapons could trigger an arms race. In 2003, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to repeal the 1993 [[John Spratt|Spratt]]-[[Elizabeth Furse|Furse]] ban on the development of small nuclear weapons.\u00a0This change was part of the 2004 fiscal year defense authorization. The Bush administration wanted the repeal so that they could develop weapons to address the threat from North Korea. \"Low-yield weapons\" (those with one-third the force of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945) were permitted to be developed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/10/world/senate-panel-votes-to-lift-ban-on-small-nuclear-arms.html|title=Senate Panel Votes to Lift Ban on Small Nuclear Arms|last=Dao|first=James C.|date=2003-05-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nStatements by the U.S. government in 2004 indicated that they planned to decrease the arsenal to around 5,500 total warheads by 2012.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert S. |last=Norris |first2=Hans M. |last2=Kristensen |authorlink2=Hans M.

By official count, a total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 100 of them taking place at sites in the [[Pacific Ocean]], over 900 of them at the [[Nevada]] [[Nevada Test Site|Test Site]], and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States ([[Alaska]], [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Mexico]]).<ref name=\"NWA\" /> Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were atmospheric (that is, above-ground); after the acceptance of the Partial Test Ban Treaty all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.\n\nThe U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing exposed a number of the population to the hazards of fallout. Estimating exact numbers, and the exact consequences, of people exposed has been medically very difficult, with the exception of the high exposures of Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishers in the case of the [[Castle Bravo]] incident in 1954. A number of groups of U.S. citizens\u2014especially farmers and inhabitants of cities downwind of the Nevada Test Site and U.S. military workers at various tests\u2014have sued for compensation and recognition of their exposure, many successfully. The passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allowed for a systematic filing of compensation claims in relation to testing as well as those employed at nuclear weapons facilities. By June 2009 over $1.4 billion total has been given in compensation, with over $660 million going to \"[[downwinders]]\".<ref name=\"usdoj\" />\n\nA few notable U.S. nuclear tests include:\n* [[Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, was the world's first test of a nuclear weapon (yield of around 20 kt).\n* [[Operation Crossroads]] series in July 1946, was the first postwar test series and one of the largest military operations in U.S. history.\n* [[Operation Greenhouse]] shots of May 1951 included the first [[boosted fission weapon]] test (\"Item\") and a scientific test that proved the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons (\"George\").\n* [[Ivy Mike]] shot of 1 November 1952, was the first full test of a [[Teller-Ulam design]] \"staged\" hydrogen bomb, with a yield of 10 megatons. It was not a deployable weapon, however\u2014with its full [[cryogenic]] equipment it weighed some 82 tons.\n* [[Castle Bravo]] shot of 1 March 1954, was the first test of a deployable (solid fuel) thermonuclear weapon, and also (accidentally) the largest weapon ever tested by the United States (15 megatons). It was also the single largest U.S. radiological accident in connection with nuclear testing. The unanticipated yield, and a change in the weather, resulted in nuclear fallout spreading eastward onto the inhabited [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]] and [[Rongerik Atoll|Rongerik]] atolls, which were soon evacuated. Many of the Marshall Islanders have since suffered from [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] and have received some compensation from the federal government. A Japanese fishing boat, ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'', also came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill; one eventually died.\n* Shot Argus I of [[Operation Argus]], on 27 August 1958, was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon in [[outer space]] when a 1.7-kiloton warhead was detonated at an altitude of {{convert|200|km}} during a series of [[high altitude nuclear explosion]]s.\n* Shot Frigate Bird of [[Operation Dominic I and II|Operation Dominic I]] on 6 May 1962, was the only U.S. test of an operational [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM) with a live nuclear warhead (yield of 600 kilotons), at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]]. In general, missile systems were tested without live warheads and warheads were tested separately for safety concerns. In the early 1960s, however, there mounted technical questions about how the systems would behave under combat conditions (when they were \"mated\", in military parlance), and this test was meant to dispel these concerns. However, the warhead had to be somewhat modified before its use, and the missile was a SLBM (and not an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]), so by itself it did not satisfy all concerns.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald A. |last=MacKenzie |authorlink=Donald Angus MacKenzie |year=1993 |title=Inventing Accuracy: A Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance |url=https://archive.org/details/inventingaccurac00dona |url-access=registration |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-63147-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/inventingaccurac00dona/page/343 343]\u2013344}}</ref>\n* Shot [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan]] of [[Operation Storax]] on 6 July 1962 (yield of 104 kilotons), was an attempt to show the feasibility of using nuclear weapons for \"civilian\" and \"peaceful\" purposes as part of [[Operation Plowshare]].

Warren AFB 120407-F-JW079-036.jpg|thumb|From left are the Peacekeeper, the Minuteman III and the Minuteman I]]\nThe original Little Boy and Fat Man weapons, developed by the United States during the [[Manhattan Project]], were relatively large (Fat Man had a diameter of {{convert|5|ft}}) and heavy (around 5 tons each) and required specially modified bomber planes to be adapted for their bombing missions against Japan. Each modified bomber could only carry one such weapon and only within a limited range. After these initial weapons were developed, a considerable amount of money and research was conducted towards the goal of standardizing nuclear warheads so that they did not require highly specialized experts to assemble them before use, as in the case with the idiosyncratic wartime devices, and miniaturization of the warheads for use in more variable delivery systems.\n\nThrough the aid of brainpower acquired through [[Operation Paperclip]] at the tail end of the European theater of [[World War II]], the United States was able to embark on an ambitious program in [[rocket]]ry. One of the first products of this was the development of rockets capable of holding nuclear warheads. The [[MGR-1 Honest John]] was the first such weapon, developed in 1953 as a surface-to-surface missile with a {{convert|15|mi|adj=on}} maximum range. Because of their limited range, their potential use was heavily constrained (they could not, for example, threaten [[Moscow]] with an immediate strike).\n\n[[File:MGR-1 Honest John rocket.jpg|right|thumb|The [[MGR-1 Honest John]] was the first nuclear-tipped [[rocket]] developed by the U.S.]]\n[[File:Convair B-36 Peacemaker.jpg|right|thumb|The B-36 Peacemaker in flight]]\n\nDevelopment of long-range bombers, such as the [[B-29 Superfortress]] during World War II, was continued during the [[Cold War]] period. In 1946, the [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker]] became the first purpose-built nuclear bomber; it served with the USAF until 1959. The [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] was able by the mid-1950s to carry a wide arsenal of nuclear bombs, each with different capabilities and potential use situations. Starting in 1946, the U.S. based its initial deterrence force on the [[Strategic Air Command]], which, by the late 1950s, maintained a number of nuclear-armed bombers in the sky at all times, prepared to receive orders to attack the USSR whenever needed. This system was, however, tremendously expensive, both in terms of natural and human resources, and raised the possibility of an accidental nuclear war.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, elaborate computerized early warning systems such as [[Defense Support Program]] were developed to detect incoming Soviet attacks and to coordinate response strategies. During this same period, [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) systems were developed that could deliver a nuclear payload across vast distances, allowing the U.S. to house nuclear forces capable of hitting the Soviet Union in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]]. Shorter-range weapons, including small tactical weapons, were fielded in Europe as well, including [[nuclear artillery]] and man-portable [[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]]. The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile systems allowed for hidden [[nuclear submarines]] to covertly launch missiles at distant targets as well, making it virtually impossible for the Soviet Union to successfully launch a [[first strike]] attack against the United States without receiving a deadly response.\n\nImprovements in warhead miniaturization in the 1970s and 1980s allowed for the development of MIRVs\u2014missiles which could carry multiple warheads, each of which could be separately targeted. The question of whether these missiles should be based on constantly rotating train tracks (to avoid being easily targeted by opposing Soviet missiles) or based in heavily fortified silos (to possibly withstand a Soviet attack) was a major political controversy in the 1980s (eventually the silo deployment method was chosen). MIRVed systems enabled the U.S. to render Soviet missile defenses economically unfeasible, as each offensive missile would require between three and ten defensive missiles to counter.\n\nAdditional developments in weapons delivery included [[cruise missile]] systems, which allowed a plane to fire a long-distance, low-flying nuclear-tipped missile towards a target from a relatively comfortable distance.\n\n[[File:Nuclear weapon size chart.jpg|center|Comparing the size of U.S. nuclear weapons over time.]]\n\nThe current delivery systems of the U.S. make virtually any part of the Earth's surface within the reach of its nuclear arsenal. Though its land-based missile systems have a maximum range of {{convert|10000|km}} (less than worldwide), its submarine-based forces extend its reach from a coastline {{convert|12000|km}} inland. Additionally, [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refueling]] of long-range bombers and the use of [[aircraft carrier]]s extends the possible range virtually indefinitely.\n\n==Command and control==\n[[File:Armed Forces Welcome Ceremony in Honor of the Twentieth Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (48823202582).jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] has sole authority to launch U.S. nuclear weapons, whether as a first strike or nuclear retaliation.]]\n[[Command and control]] procedures in case of [[nuclear war]] were given by the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]] (SIOP) until 2003, when this was superseded by Operations Plan 8044.\n\nSince [[World War II]], the President of the United States has had sole authority to launch U.S. nuclear weapons, whether as a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] or [[second strike|nuclear retaliation]]. This arrangement was seen as necessary during the [[Cold War]] to present a credible [[nuclear deterrent]]; if an attack was detected, the United States would have only minutes to launch a counterstrike before its nuclear capability was severely damaged, or national leaders killed.  If the President has been killed, command authority follows the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]. Changes to this policy have been proposed, but currently the only way to countermand such an order before the strike was launched would be for the Vice President and the majority of the Cabinet to relieve the President under Section 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2017/10/03/555266383/why-president-trump-has-exclusive-authority-to-order-a-nuclear-strike Why President Trump Has Exclusive Authority To Order A Nuclear Strike]</ref><ref name=Rosenbaum>{{cite journal|author1=Ron Rosenbaum|title=An Unsung Hero of the Nuclear Age \u2013 Maj.

How close any of these accidents came to being major nuclear disasters is a matter of technical and scholarly debate and interpretation.\n\nWeapons accidentally dropped by the United States include incidents near [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] (1957), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1958) (see [[Tybee Bomb]]), [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]] (1961) (see [[1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash]]), off the coast of [[Okinawa]] (1965), in the sea near [[Palomares, Almer\u00eda|Palomares]], Spain (1966, see [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]]), and near [[Thule Air Base]], [[Greenland]] (1968) (see [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]]). In some of these cases (such as the 1966 Palomares case), the explosive system of the fission weapon discharged, but did not trigger a [[nuclear chain reaction]] (safety features prevent this from easily happening), but did disperse hazardous nuclear materials across wide areas, necessitating expensive cleanup endeavors. Eleven American nuclear warheads are thought<ref name=\"Brookings\"/> to be lost and unrecovered, primarily in submarine accidents. The [[1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion]] in [[Damascus, Arkansas]], threw a warhead 30 meters from its silo but did not release any radiation.\n\nThe nuclear testing program resulted in a number of cases of fallout dispersion onto populated areas.

In 1940 the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) was established, coordinating work under the Committee on Uranium among its other wartime efforts.

In 1941, NDRC research was placed under direct control of [[Vannevar Bush]] as the OSRD S-1 Section, which attempted to increase the pace of weapons research. In June 1942, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] took over the project to develop atomic weapons, while the OSRD retained responsibility for scientific research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/s/smythoverview.htm |title=Henry DeWolf Smyth Papers Collection Overview 1885\u20131987 |website=[[American Philosophical Society]] |accessdate=21 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511094050/http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/s/smythoverview.htm |archivedate=11 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThis was the beginning of the [[Manhattan Project]], run as the Manhattan Engineering District (MED), an agency under military control that was in charge of developing the first atomic weapons. After [[World War II]], the MED maintained control over the U.S. arsenal and production facilities and coordinated the [[Operation Crossroads]] tests. In 1946 after a long and protracted debate, the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] was passed, creating the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) as a civilian agency that would be in charge of the production of nuclear weapons and research facilities, funded through Congress, with oversight provided by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The AEC was given vast powers of control over secrecy, research, and money, and could seize lands with suspected uranium deposits.

The already-built weapons themselves are in the control of the [[United States Strategic Command|Strategic Command]], which is part of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].\n\nIn general, these agencies served to coordinate research and build sites. They generally operated their sites through contractors, however, both private and public (for example, [[Union Carbide]], a private company, ran [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] for many decades; the [[University of California]], a public educational institution, has run the Los Alamos and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] laboratories since their inception, and will jointly manage Los Alamos with the private company [[Bechtel]] as of its next contract). Funding was received both through these agencies directly, but also from additional outside agencies, such as the Department of Defense. Each branch of the military also maintained its own nuclear-related research agencies (generally related to delivery systems).\n\n==Weapons production complex==\nThis table is not comprehensive, as numerous facilities throughout the United States have contributed to its nuclear weapons program. It includes the major sites related to the U.S. weapons program (past and present), their basic site functions, and their current status of activity.

In addition to deploying weapons on its own soil, during the [[Cold War]], the United States also stationed nuclear weapons in 27 foreign countries and territories, including [[Okinawa]] (which was [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|US-controlled until 1971]],) Japan (during the occupation immediately following World War II), [[Greenland]], Germany, [[Taiwan]], and [[French Morocco]] then [[Morocco|independent Morocco]].<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |website=National Security Archive |date=20 October 1999 |title=United States Secretly Deployed Nuclear Bombs in 27 Countries and Territories During Cold War |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/19991020/index.html |accessdate=6 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

These three parties agreed not to share nuclear weapons information with other countries without the consent of the others, an early attempt at [[Nuclear proliferation|nonproliferation]]. After the development of the first nuclear weapons during [[World War II]], though, there was much debate within the political circles and public sphere of the United States about whether or not the country should attempt to maintain a [[monopoly]] on [[nuclear technology]], or whether it should undertake a program of information sharing with other nations (especially its former ally and likely competitor, the [[Soviet Union]]), or submit control of its weapons to some sort of international organization (such as the [[United Nations]]) who would use them to attempt to maintain [[world peace]]. Though fear of a [[nuclear arms race]] spurred many politicians and scientists to advocate some degree of international control or sharing of nuclear weapons and information, many politicians and members of the military believed that it was better in the short term to maintain high standards of nuclear [[secrecy]] and to forestall a Soviet bomb as long as possible (and they did not believe the USSR would actually submit to international controls in good faith).\n\nSince this path was chosen, the United States was, in its early days, essentially an advocate for the prevention of [[nuclear proliferation]], though primarily for the reason of self-preservation. A few years after the USSR detonated its first weapon in 1949, though, the U.S. under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sought to encourage a program of sharing nuclear information related to civilian [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear physics]] in general. The [[Atoms for Peace]] program, begun in 1953, was also in part political: the U.S. was better poised to commit various scarce resources, such as [[enriched uranium]], towards this peaceful effort, and to request a similar contribution from the Soviet Union, who had far fewer resources along these lines; thus the program had a strategic justification as well, as was later revealed by internal memos. This overall goal of promoting civilian use of nuclear energy in other countries, while also preventing weapons dissemination, has been labeled by many critics as contradictory and having led to lax standards for a number of decades which allowed a number of other nations, such as China and India, to profit from [[dual-use technology]] (purchased from nations other than the U.S.).\n\nThe [[Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|Cooperative Threat Reduction]] program of the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] was established after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 to aid former Soviet bloc countries in the inventory and destruction of their sites for developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and their methods of delivering them (ICBM silos, long-range bombers, etc.). Over $4.4 billion has been spent on this endeavor to prevent purposeful or accidental proliferation of weapons from the former Soviet arsenal.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Larsen, Jeffrey Arthur|author2=Smith, Dr. James M.|title=Historical Dictionary of Arms Control and Disarmament|date=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810850606|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0000lars/page/65 65]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0000lars|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAfter India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] imposed [[economic sanctions]] on the countries. In 1999, however, the sanctions against India were lifted; those against Pakistan were kept in place as a result of the military government that had taken over. Shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] lifted the sanctions against Pakistan as well, in order to get the Pakistani government's help as a conduit for US and NATO forces for [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|operations in Afghanistan]].\n\nThe U.S. government has officially taken a silent policy towards the nuclear weapons ambitions of the state of Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].

After a slow start under the direction of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]], at the urging of British scientists and American administrators, the program was put under the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], and in 1942 it was officially transferred under the auspices of the [[United States Army]] and became known as the [[Manhattan Project]], an American, British and Canadian joint venture. Under the direction of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Leslie Groves]], over thirty different sites were constructed for the research, production, and testing of components related to bomb-making. These included the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], under the direction of physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]], the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] [[plutonium]] production facility in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and the [[Y-12 National Security Complex]] in [[Tennessee]].\n\nBy investing heavily in breeding plutonium in early [[nuclear reactor]]s and in the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion enrichment processes for the production of [[uranium-235]], the United States was able to develop three usable weapons by mid-1945. The [[Trinity test]] was a plutonium [[Nuclear weapon design|implosion-design]] weapon tested on 16 July 1945, with around a 20 [[kiloton]] yield.\n\nFaced with a planned [[Operation Olympic|invasion of the Japanese home islands]] scheduled to begin on 1 November 1945 and with Japan not surrendering, President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered the atomic raids on Japan. On 6 August 1945, the U.S. detonated a uranium-[[Nuclear weapons design|gun design]] bomb, [[Little Boy]], over the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] with an energy of about 15 kilotons of TNT, killing approximately 70,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese [[combatant]]s and 20,000 Korean [[Unfree labour|slave laborers]], and destroying nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]] [[headquarters]]). Three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. attacked [[Nagasaki]] using a plutonium implosion-design bomb, [[Fat Man]], with the explosion equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200\u201328,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers & Artists Against Nuclear Energy & Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22\u201329 |date=1 May 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1947, the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (known as the McMahon Act) took effect, and the Manhattan Project was officially turned over to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hewlett |first=Richard G. |authorlink=Richard G.

Many former nuclear facilities were shut down, and their sites became targets of extensive environmental remediation. Efforts were redirected from weapons production to [[stockpile stewardship]], attempting to predict the behavior of aging weapons without using full-scale nuclear testing. Increased funding was also put into anti-[[nuclear proliferation]] programs, such as helping the states of the former Soviet Union to eliminate their former nuclear sites and to assist Russia in their efforts to inventory and secure their inherited nuclear stockpile. By February 2006, over $1.2 billion had been paid under the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] of 1990 to U.S. citizens exposed to nuclear hazards as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons program, and by 1998 at least $759 million had been paid to the Marshall Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing, and over $15 million was paid to the [[Politics of Japan|Japanese government]] following the exposure of its citizens and food supply to [[nuclear fallout]] from the 1954 [[Bravo test|\"Bravo\" test]].<ref name=\"Brookings\"/><ref name=\"usdoj\" /> In 1998, the country spent an estimated total of $35.1 billion on its nuclear weapons and weapons-related programs.<ref name=\"Brookings\"/>\n[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|250px|Large stockpile with global range (dark blue)]]\nIn the 2013 book ''Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters'' (Oxford), [[Kate Brown (professor)|Kate Brown]] explores the health of affected citizens in the United States, and the \"slow-motion disasters\" that still threaten the environments where the plants are located. According to Brown, the plants at Hanford, over a period of four decades, released millions of curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment.<ref name=katebr/> Brown says that most of this [[radioactive contamination]] over the years at Hanford were part of normal operations, but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret, as the pollution continued unabated. Even today, as pollution threats to health and the environment persist, the government keeps knowledge about the associated risks from the public.<ref name=katebr/>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[George W. Bush]], and especially after the 11 September [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks]] of 2001, rumors circulated in major news sources that the U.S. was considering designing new nuclear weapons ([[Nuclear bunker buster|\"bunker-busting nukes\"]]) and resuming nuclear testing for reasons of stockpile stewardship. Republicans argued that small nuclear weapons appear more likely to be used than large nuclear weapons, and thus small nuclear weapons pose a more credible threat that has more of a deterrent effect against hostile behavior. Democrats counterargued that allowing the weapons could trigger an arms race. In 2003, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to repeal the 1993 [[John Spratt|Spratt]]-[[Elizabeth Furse|Furse]] ban on the development of small nuclear weapons.\u00a0This change was part of the 2004 fiscal year defense authorization.

By official count, a total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 100 of them taking place at sites in the [[Pacific Ocean]], over 900 of them at the [[Nevada]] [[Nevada Test Site|Test Site]], and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States ([[Alaska]], [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Mexico]]).<ref name=\"NWA\" /> Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were atmospheric (that is, above-ground); after the acceptance of the Partial Test Ban Treaty all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.\n\nThe U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing exposed a number of the population to the hazards of fallout. Estimating exact numbers, and the exact consequences, of people exposed has been medically very difficult, with the exception of the high exposures of Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishers in the case of the [[Castle Bravo]] incident in 1954. A number of groups of U.S. citizens\u2014especially farmers and inhabitants of cities downwind of the Nevada Test Site and U.S. military workers at various tests\u2014have sued for compensation and recognition of their exposure, many successfully. The passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allowed for a systematic filing of compensation claims in relation to testing as well as those employed at nuclear weapons facilities. By June 2009 over $1.4 billion total has been given in compensation, with over $660 million going to \"[[downwinders]]\".<ref name=\"usdoj\" />\n\nA few notable U.S. nuclear tests include:\n* [[Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, was the world's first test of a nuclear weapon (yield of around 20 kt).\n* [[Operation Crossroads]] series in July 1946, was the first postwar test series and one of the largest military operations in U.S. history.\n* [[Operation Greenhouse]] shots of May 1951 included the first [[boosted fission weapon]] test (\"Item\") and a scientific test that proved the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons (\"George\").\n* [[Ivy Mike]] shot of 1 November 1952, was the first full test of a [[Teller-Ulam design]] \"staged\" hydrogen bomb, with a yield of 10 megatons. It was not a deployable weapon, however\u2014with its full [[cryogenic]] equipment it weighed some 82 tons.\n* [[Castle Bravo]] shot of 1 March 1954, was the first test of a deployable (solid fuel) thermonuclear weapon, and also (accidentally) the largest weapon ever tested by the United States (15 megatons). It was also the single largest U.S. radiological accident in connection with nuclear testing. The unanticipated yield, and a change in the weather, resulted in nuclear fallout spreading eastward onto the inhabited [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]] and [[Rongerik Atoll|Rongerik]] atolls, which were soon evacuated. Many of the Marshall Islanders have since suffered from [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] and have received some compensation from the federal government. A Japanese fishing boat, ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'', also came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill; one eventually died.\n* Shot Argus I of [[Operation Argus]], on 27 August 1958, was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon in [[outer space]] when a 1.7-kiloton warhead was detonated at an altitude of {{convert|200|km}} during a series of [[high altitude nuclear explosion]]s.\n* Shot Frigate Bird of [[Operation Dominic I and II|Operation Dominic I]] on 6 May 1962, was the only U.S. test of an operational [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM) with a live nuclear warhead (yield of 600 kilotons), at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]]. In general, missile systems were tested without live warheads and warheads were tested separately for safety concerns. In the early 1960s, however, there mounted technical questions about how the systems would behave under combat conditions (when they were \"mated\", in military parlance), and this test was meant to dispel these concerns. However, the warhead had to be somewhat modified before its use, and the missile was a SLBM (and not an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]), so by itself it did not satisfy all concerns.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald A. |last=MacKenzie |authorlink=Donald Angus MacKenzie |year=1993 |title=Inventing Accuracy: A Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance |url=https://archive.org/details/inventingaccurac00dona |url-access=registration |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-63147-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/inventingaccurac00dona/page/343 343]\u2013344}}</ref>\n* Shot [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan]] of [[Operation Storax]] on 6 July 1962 (yield of 104 kilotons), was an attempt to show the feasibility of using nuclear weapons for \"civilian\" and \"peaceful\" purposes as part of [[Operation Plowshare]].

Warren AFB 120407-F-JW079-036.jpg|thumb|From left are the Peacekeeper, the Minuteman III and the Minuteman I]]\nThe original Little Boy and Fat Man weapons, developed by the United States during the [[Manhattan Project]], were relatively large (Fat Man had a diameter of {{convert|5|ft}}) and heavy (around 5 tons each) and required specially modified bomber planes to be adapted for their bombing missions against Japan. Each modified bomber could only carry one such weapon and only within a limited range. After these initial weapons were developed, a considerable amount of money and research was conducted towards the goal of standardizing nuclear warheads so that they did not require highly specialized experts to assemble them before use, as in the case with the idiosyncratic wartime devices, and miniaturization of the warheads for use in more variable delivery systems.\n\nThrough the aid of brainpower acquired through [[Operation Paperclip]] at the tail end of the European theater of [[World War II]], the United States was able to embark on an ambitious program in [[rocket]]ry. One of the first products of this was the development of rockets capable of holding nuclear warheads. The [[MGR-1 Honest John]] was the first such weapon, developed in 1953 as a surface-to-surface missile with a {{convert|15|mi|adj=on}} maximum range. Because of their limited range, their potential use was heavily constrained (they could not, for example, threaten [[Moscow]] with an immediate strike).\n\n[[File:MGR-1 Honest John rocket.jpg|right|thumb|The [[MGR-1 Honest John]] was the first nuclear-tipped [[rocket]] developed by the U.S.]]\n[[File:Convair B-36 Peacemaker.jpg|right|thumb|The B-36 Peacemaker in flight]]\n\nDevelopment of long-range bombers, such as the [[B-29 Superfortress]] during World War II, was continued during the [[Cold War]] period. In 1946, the [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker]] became the first purpose-built nuclear bomber; it served with the USAF until 1959. The [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] was able by the mid-1950s to carry a wide arsenal of nuclear bombs, each with different capabilities and potential use situations. Starting in 1946, the U.S. based its initial deterrence force on the [[Strategic Air Command]], which, by the late 1950s, maintained a number of nuclear-armed bombers in the sky at all times, prepared to receive orders to attack the USSR whenever needed. This system was, however, tremendously expensive, both in terms of natural and human resources, and raised the possibility of an accidental nuclear war.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, elaborate computerized early warning systems such as [[Defense Support Program]] were developed to detect incoming Soviet attacks and to coordinate response strategies. During this same period, [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) systems were developed that could deliver a nuclear payload across vast distances, allowing the U.S. to house nuclear forces capable of hitting the Soviet Union in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]]. Shorter-range weapons, including small tactical weapons, were fielded in Europe as well, including [[nuclear artillery]] and man-portable [[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]]. The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile systems allowed for hidden [[nuclear submarines]] to covertly launch missiles at distant targets as well, making it virtually impossible for the Soviet Union to successfully launch a [[first strike]] attack against the United States without receiving a deadly response.\n\nImprovements in warhead miniaturization in the 1970s and 1980s allowed for the development of MIRVs\u2014missiles which could carry multiple warheads, each of which could be separately targeted. The question of whether these missiles should be based on constantly rotating train tracks (to avoid being easily targeted by opposing Soviet missiles) or based in heavily fortified silos (to possibly withstand a Soviet attack) was a major political controversy in the 1980s (eventually the silo deployment method was chosen). MIRVed systems enabled the U.S. to render Soviet missile defenses economically unfeasible, as each offensive missile would require between three and ten defensive missiles to counter.\n\nAdditional developments in weapons delivery included [[cruise missile]] systems, which allowed a plane to fire a long-distance, low-flying nuclear-tipped missile towards a target from a relatively comfortable distance.\n\n[[File:Nuclear weapon size chart.jpg|center|Comparing the size of U.S. nuclear weapons over time.]]\n\nThe current delivery systems of the U.S. make virtually any part of the Earth's surface within the reach of its nuclear arsenal. Though its land-based missile systems have a maximum range of {{convert|10000|km}} (less than worldwide), its submarine-based forces extend its reach from a coastline {{convert|12000|km}} inland. Additionally, [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refueling]] of long-range bombers and the use of [[aircraft carrier]]s extends the possible range virtually indefinitely.\n\n==Command and control==\n[[File:Armed Forces Welcome Ceremony in Honor of the Twentieth Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (48823202582).jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] has sole authority to launch U.S. nuclear weapons, whether as a first strike or nuclear retaliation.]]\n[[Command and control]] procedures in case of [[nuclear war]] were given by the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]] (SIOP) until 2003, when this was superseded by Operations Plan 8044.\n\nSince [[World War II]], the President of the United States has had sole authority to launch U.S. nuclear weapons, whether as a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] or [[second strike|nuclear retaliation]]. This arrangement was seen as necessary during the [[Cold War]] to present a credible [[nuclear deterrent]]; if an attack was detected, the United States would have only minutes to launch a counterstrike before its nuclear capability was severely damaged, or national leaders killed.  If the President has been killed, command authority follows the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]. Changes to this policy have been proposed, but currently the only way to countermand such an order before the strike was launched would be for the Vice President and the majority of the Cabinet to relieve the President under Section 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2017/10/03/555266383/why-president-trump-has-exclusive-authority-to-order-a-nuclear-strike Why President Trump Has Exclusive Authority To Order A Nuclear Strike]</ref><ref name=Rosenbaum>{{cite journal|author1=Ron Rosenbaum|title=An Unsung Hero of the Nuclear Age \u2013 Maj.

How close any of these accidents came to being major nuclear disasters is a matter of technical and scholarly debate and interpretation.\n\nWeapons accidentally dropped by the United States include incidents near [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] (1957), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1958) (see [[Tybee Bomb]]), [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]] (1961) (see [[1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash]]), off the coast of [[Okinawa]] (1965), in the sea near [[Palomares, Almer\u00eda|Palomares]], Spain (1966, see [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]]), and near [[Thule Air Base]], [[Greenland]] (1968) (see [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]]). In some of these cases (such as the 1966 Palomares case), the explosive system of the fission weapon discharged, but did not trigger a [[nuclear chain reaction]] (safety features prevent this from easily happening), but did disperse hazardous nuclear materials across wide areas, necessitating expensive cleanup endeavors. Eleven American nuclear warheads are thought<ref name=\"Brookings\"/> to be lost and unrecovered, primarily in submarine accidents. The [[1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion]] in [[Damascus, Arkansas]], threw a warhead 30 meters from its silo but did not release any radiation.\n\nThe nuclear testing program resulted in a number of cases of fallout dispersion onto populated areas.

In 1940 the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) was established, coordinating work under the Committee on Uranium among its other wartime efforts.

After [[World War II]], the MED maintained control over the U.S. arsenal and production facilities and coordinated the [[Operation Crossroads]] tests. In 1946 after a long and protracted debate, the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] was passed, creating the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) as a civilian agency that would be in charge of the production of nuclear weapons and research facilities, funded through Congress, with oversight provided by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The AEC was given vast powers of control over secrecy, research, and money, and could seize lands with suspected uranium deposits.

The already-built weapons themselves are in the control of the [[United States Strategic Command|Strategic Command]], which is part of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].\n\nIn general, these agencies served to coordinate research and build sites. They generally operated their sites through contractors, however, both private and public (for example, [[Union Carbide]], a private company, ran [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] for many decades; the [[University of California]], a public educational institution, has run the Los Alamos and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] laboratories since their inception, and will jointly manage Los Alamos with the private company [[Bechtel]] as of its next contract). Funding was received both through these agencies directly, but also from additional outside agencies, such as the Department of Defense. Each branch of the military also maintained its own nuclear-related research agencies (generally related to delivery systems).\n\n==Weapons production complex==\nThis table is not comprehensive, as numerous facilities throughout the United States have contributed to its nuclear weapons program. It includes the major sites related to the U.S. weapons program (past and present), their basic site functions, and their current status of activity.

In addition to deploying weapons on its own soil, during the [[Cold War]], the United States also stationed nuclear weapons in 27 foreign countries and territories, including [[Okinawa]] (which was [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|US-controlled until 1971]],) Japan (during the occupation immediately following World War II), [[Greenland]], Germany, [[Taiwan]], and [[French Morocco]] then [[Morocco|independent Morocco]].<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |website=National Security Archive |date=20 October 1999 |title=United States Secretly Deployed Nuclear Bombs in 27 Countries and Territories During Cold War |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/19991020/index.html |accessdate=6 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

These three parties agreed not to share nuclear weapons information with other countries without the consent of the others, an early attempt at [[Nuclear proliferation|nonproliferation]]. After the development of the first nuclear weapons during [[World War II]], though, there was much debate within the political circles and public sphere of the United States about whether or not the country should attempt to maintain a [[monopoly]] on [[nuclear technology]], or whether it should undertake a program of information sharing with other nations (especially its former ally and likely competitor, the [[Soviet Union]]), or submit control of its weapons to some sort of international organization (such as the [[United Nations]]) who would use them to attempt to maintain [[world peace]]. Though fear of a [[nuclear arms race]] spurred many politicians and scientists to advocate some degree of international control or sharing of nuclear weapons and information, many politicians and members of the military believed that it was better in the short term to maintain high standards of nuclear [[secrecy]] and to forestall a Soviet bomb as long as possible (and they did not believe the USSR would actually submit to international controls in good faith).\n\nSince this path was chosen, the United States was, in its early days, essentially an advocate for the prevention of [[nuclear proliferation]], though primarily for the reason of self-preservation. A few years after the USSR detonated its first weapon in 1949, though, the U.S. under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sought to encourage a program of sharing nuclear information related to civilian [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear physics]] in general. The [[Atoms for Peace]] program, begun in 1953, was also in part political: the U.S. was better poised to commit various scarce resources, such as [[enriched uranium]], towards this peaceful effort, and to request a similar contribution from the Soviet Union, who had far fewer resources along these lines; thus the program had a strategic justification as well, as was later revealed by internal memos. This overall goal of promoting civilian use of nuclear energy in other countries, while also preventing weapons dissemination, has been labeled by many critics as contradictory and having led to lax standards for a number of decades which allowed a number of other nations, such as China and India, to profit from [[dual-use technology]] (purchased from nations other than the U.S.).\n\nThe [[Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|Cooperative Threat Reduction]] program of the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] was established after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 to aid former Soviet bloc countries in the inventory and destruction of their sites for developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and their methods of delivering them (ICBM silos, long-range bombers, etc.). Over $4.4 billion has been spent on this endeavor to prevent purposeful or accidental proliferation of weapons from the former Soviet arsenal.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Larsen, Jeffrey Arthur|author2=Smith, Dr. James M.|title=Historical Dictionary of Arms Control and Disarmament|date=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810850606|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0000lars/page/65 65]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0000lars|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAfter India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] imposed [[economic sanctions]] on the countries. In 1999, however, the sanctions against India were lifted; those against Pakistan were kept in place as a result of the military government that had taken over. Shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] lifted the sanctions against Pakistan as well, in order to get the Pakistani government's help as a conduit for US and NATO forces for [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|operations in Afghanistan]].\n\nThe U.S. government has officially taken a silent policy towards the nuclear weapons ambitions of the state of Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].

Earlier, from 1397 to 1750 the ''Fitzroya'' woods of Cordillera Pelada also suffered from fires that originated from lightning strikes and indigenous inhabitants.<ref>{{Citation\n |last1       = Lara\n |first1      = A.\n |last2       = Fraver\n |first2      = S.\n |last3       = Aravena\n |first3      = J.C.\n |last4       = Wolodarsky-Franke\n |first4      = F.\n |title       = Fire and the dynamics of Fitzroya cupressoides (alerce) forests of Chile's Cordillera Pelada\n |journal     = [[\u00c9coscience]]\n |volume      = 6\n |issue       = 1\n |year        = 1999\n |pages       = 100\u2013109\n |url         = http://www.ecoscience.ulaval.ca/en/paper/fire-and-the-dynamics-of-fitzroya-cupressoides-alerce-forests-of-chile-s-cordillera-pelada\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140827141331/http://www.ecoscience.ulaval.ca/en/paper/fire-and-the-dynamics-of-fitzroya-cupressoides-alerce-forests-of-chile-s-cordillera-pelada\n |archivedate = 2014-08-27\n}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nThe area of [[Valdivia]] and the [[Los R\u00edos Region]] has a rainy temperate climate, with rains all year round.
