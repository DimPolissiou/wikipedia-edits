The film was co-written, directed, and produced by series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], with live-action sequences directed by [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]]. It features the series' cast of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Rodger Bumpass]] and [[Mr. Lawrence]], and also has new actors which include [[Alec Baldwin]], [[David Hasselhoff]] (as himself), [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. It is the first film in the ''[[List of SpongeBob SquarePants films|SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' film series. In this film, [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]] devises a plan to discredit his business nemesis [[Mr. Krabs]], steal the [[Krabby Patty]] secret formula and take over the world by stealing [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]]'s crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and the oceanic world from Plankton's rule.\n\nPrevious offers by [[Paramount Pictures]] for a film adaptation of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' had been rejected by Stephen Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one offer in 2002. A writing team consisting of Hillenburg, [[Paul Tibbitt]], [[Derek Drymon]], [[Aaron Springer]], [[Kent Osborne]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was assembled, conceiving the idea of a mythical hero's quest and the search for a stolen crown, which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended as the [[series finale]], but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.\n\nThe film was widely promoted by Paramount and Nickelodeon, with tie-in promotions made by [[7-Eleven]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Burger King]], which decorated various of its franchises with {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} SpongeBob inflatable figures. The film was released on November 19, 2004, grossing $140 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> and received generally positive reviews from critics. A second film titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' was released on February 6, 2015, and another titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'' is scheduled for release on July 31, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please keep the plot brief and concise. DO NOT ADD EVERY DETAIL.-->\nA band of [[Piracy|pirates]] discover a treasure chest full of movie tickets to see <nowiki>''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.'' All of the pirates cheer and sing ''</nowiki>[[SpongeBob SquarePants theme|the SpongeBob theme song]]<nowiki>''</nowiki> as they head to the movie theater to see the motion picture.\n\nThe movie begins when [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] gets a dream of himself imitating in an action film when he wakes up, cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for a second [[Krusty Krab]], expecting his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] to promote him as new manager of the new restaurant. Instead, Mr. Krabs names [[Squidward Tentacles]], SpongeBob\u2019s next-door neighbor and co-worker, as manager, thinking SpongeBob is too immature to handle the role, much to SpongeBob's depression. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs' business rival, [[Plankton and Karen#Plankton|Plankton]], complains about his failures to his computer wife [[Plankton and Karen#Karen|Karen]], being unable to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When Karen points out plan \"Z\", a scheme which he has yet to attempt, Plankton decides to implement it.\n\nThat night, SpongeBob drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend [[Patrick Star]]. Elsewhere, Plankton steals [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Supporting characters|King Neptune]]'s crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to the distant land of Shell City. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob arrives and chastises Mr. Krabs under the influence of an ice-cream headache, but seeing his boss's life at risk shocks SpongeBob back to his senses and he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is convinced by his daughter Mindy to spare Mr. Krabs for the time being and freezes him instead, ordering SpongeBob to return with the crown in exactly six days. Soon after SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket. He also gives away free Chum Bucket helmets to his customers, which are actually mind-controlling devices that Plankton activates to control Bikini Bottom's residents and take over the city. Squidward goes to the Chum Bucket to confront Plankton, but is captured and enslaved by the customers.\n\nAfter overcoming several setbacks on their journey, including sacrificing the Patty Wagon to escape a ravenous [[frogfish]], SpongeBob and Patrick reach a dangerous, monster-filled trench. When they finally come to the conclusion that they cannot finish the mission due to their immaturity, they tearfully give up. Mindy arrives at the trench and tells SpongeBob and Patrick about Plankton's plan. She pretends to magically turn them into men by giving them seaweed mustaches. With their confidence boosted, they brave the trench but are confronted by Dennis, a hitman hired by Plankton to eliminate them. Suddenly, Dennis is stepped on by a hard-hat diver that SpongeBob and Patrick believe to be a [[Cyclops]]. The Cyclops grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.\n\nIn the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but die when they are dehydrated by the Cyclops' heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving them and the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the vengeful sea creatures attack and overwhelm the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach, where [[David Hasselhoff]] appears and offers them a ride. He swims from the beach to Bikini Bottom carrying them on his back. Dennis catches up to them, but is knocked back into the sea by a [[catamaran]]. Then, when they arrive at Bikini Bottom, Hasselhoff launches SpongeBob and Patrick down to the Krusty Krab 2.\n\nAt the Krusty Krab 2, King Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs much to Plankton's enjoyment and Mindy's horror, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just before he is able to do so. They and Mindy confront Plankton, but he drops a king size mind-controlling bucket on Neptune, enslaving him and revealing that Plankton's plan was not just to steal the Krabby Patty formula but also to set Neptune up so he could take over the world. Before Plankton can direct Neptune to kill them, SpongeBob finally accepts his immaturity and bursts into a rock song, which destroys the mind-controlling helmets, freeing King Neptune, Squidward, and the rest of Bikini Bottom's residents from Plankton's control. Plankton tries to escape, but he is stepped on and flatted by the other citizens. Plankton is arrested for all of his crimes, while Neptune thaws out Mr. Krabs, who promotes SpongeBob to manager of the Krusty Krab 2 in gratitude.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the pirates are still in the theater and an usher tells them that they have to leave, which they reluctantly do.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members|List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters}}\n<!--This list includes the main cast only, as enumerated in the film's credits.

The film was co-written, directed, and produced by series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], with live-action sequences directed by [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]]. It features the series' cast of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Rodger Bumpass]] and [[Mr. Lawrence]], and also has new actors which include [[Alec Baldwin]], [[David Hasselhoff]] (as himself), [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. It is the first film in the ''[[List of SpongeBob SquarePants films|SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' film series. In this film, [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]] devises a plan to discredit his business nemesis [[Mr. Krabs]], steal the [[Krabby Patty]] secret formula and take over the world by stealing [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]]'s crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and the oceanic world from Plankton's rule.\n\nPrevious offers by [[Paramount Pictures]] for a film adaptation of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' had been rejected by Stephen Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one offer in 2002. A writing team consisting of Hillenburg, [[Paul Tibbitt]], [[Derek Drymon]], [[Aaron Springer]], [[Kent Osborne]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was assembled, conceiving the idea of a mythical hero's quest and the search for a stolen crown, which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended as the [[series finale]], but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.\n\nThe film was widely promoted by Paramount and Nickelodeon, with tie-in promotions made by [[7-Eleven]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Burger King]], which decorated various of its franchises with {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} SpongeBob inflatable figures. The film was released on November 19, 2004, grossing $140 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> and received generally positive reviews from critics. A second film titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' was released on February 6, 2015, and another titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'' is scheduled for release on July 31, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please keep the plot brief and concise. DO NOT ADD EVERY DETAIL.-->\nA band of [[Piracy|pirates]] discover a treasure chest full of movie tickets to see <nowiki>''The SpongeBob SqaurePants Movie.'' All of the pirates cheer and sing ''</nowiki>[[SpongeBob SquarePants theme|the SpongeBob theme song]]<nowiki>''</nowiki> as they head to the movie theater to see the motion picture.\n\nThe movie begins when [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] gets a dream of himself imitating in an action film when he wakes up, cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for a second [[Krusty Krab]], expecting his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] to promote him as new manager of the new restaurant. Instead, Mr. Krabs names [[Squidward Tentacles]], SpongeBob\u2019s next-door neighbor and co-worker, as manager, thinking SpongeBob is too immature to handle the role, much to SpongeBob's depression. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs' business rival, [[Plankton and Karen#Plankton|Plankton]], complains about his failures to his computer wife [[Plankton and Karen#Karen|Karen]], being unable to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When Karen points out plan \"Z\", a scheme which he has yet to attempt, Plankton decides to implement it.\n\nThat night, SpongeBob drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend [[Patrick Star]]. Elsewhere, Plankton steals [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Supporting characters|King Neptune]]'s crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to the distant land of Shell City. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob arrives and chastises Mr. Krabs under the influence of an ice-cream headache, but seeing his boss's life at risk shocks SpongeBob back to his senses and he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is convinced by his daughter Mindy to spare Mr. Krabs for the time being and freezes him instead, ordering SpongeBob to return with the crown in exactly six days. Soon after SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket. He also gives away free Chum Bucket helmets to his customers, which are actually mind-controlling devices that Plankton activates to control Bikini Bottom's residents and take over the city. Squidward goes to the Chum Bucket to confront Plankton, but is captured and enslaved by the customers.\n\nAfter overcoming several setbacks on their journey, including sacrificing the Patty Wagon to escape a ravenous [[frogfish]], SpongeBob and Patrick reach a dangerous, monster-filled trench. When they finally come to the conclusion that they cannot finish the mission due to their immaturity, they tearfully give up. Mindy arrives at the trench and tells SpongeBob and Patrick about Plankton's plan. She pretends to magically turn them into men by giving them seaweed mustaches. With their confidence boosted, they brave the trench but are confronted by Dennis, a hitman hired by Plankton to eliminate them. Suddenly, Dennis is stepped on by a hard-hat diver that SpongeBob and Patrick believe to be a [[Cyclops]]. The Cyclops grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.\n\nIn the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but die when they are dehydrated by the Cyclops' heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving them and the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the vengeful sea creatures attack and overwhelm the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach, where [[David Hasselhoff]] appears and offers them a ride. He swims from the beach to Bikini Bottom carrying them on his back. Dennis catches up to them, but is knocked back into the sea by a [[catamaran]]. Then, when they arrive at Bikini Bottom, Hasselhoff launches SpongeBob and Patrick down to the Krusty Krab 2.\n\nAt the Krusty Krab 2, King Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs much to Plankton's enjoyment and Mindy's horror, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just before he is able to do so. They and Mindy confront Plankton, but he drops a king size mind-controlling bucket on Neptune, enslaving him and revealing that Plankton's plan was not just to steal the Krabby Patty formula but also to set Neptune up so he could take over the world. Before Plankton can direct Neptune to kill them, SpongeBob finally accepts his immaturity and bursts into a rock song, which destroys the mind-controlling helmets, freeing King Neptune, Squidward, and the rest of Bikini Bottom's residents from Plankton's control. Plankton tries to escape, but he is stepped on and flatted by the other citizens.

Lele is part of a drama called ''Vijaya\u015br\u012bn\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101'' composed by Madana. The preceptor of king [[Arjunavarman]], Madana bore the title 'B\u0101lasarasvat\u012b'.<ref>S. K.

These records prompted K. K. Lele to describe the building as the Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 or Hall of Bhoja because king Bhoja was the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the ''Sarasvat\u012bka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101bhara\u1e47a'' or 'Necklace of Sarasvat\u012b'.<ref>R.

This makes no mention of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101, noting only the ''Akl ka kua'' or \"Well of Wisdom\" in front of the tomb of Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn. Kincaid was a cynical observer but in any case the absence of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 in his text indicates was \"no living tradition about the Bhoj\u0101l\u0101 in the middle decades of the nineteenth century\" among those with whom he interacted.<ref name=willis136>{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dh\u0101r, Bhoja and Sarasvat\u012b: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=1 | year=2012 | pages=136\u2013138 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}</ref>\n\n==Sarasvat\u012b==\n[[File:Goddess Ambika from Dhar.JPG|thumb|Goddess Ambik\u0101 from Dh\u0101r, whose inscription mentions V\u0101gdev\u012b.

Lele is part of a drama called ''Vijaya\u015br\u012bn\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101'' composed by Madana. The preceptor of king [[Arjunavarman]], Madana bore the title 'B\u0101lasarasvat\u012b'.<ref>S. K.

These records prompted K. K. Lele to describe the building as the Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 or Hall of Bhoja because king Bhoja was the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the ''Sarasvat\u012bka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101bhara\u1e47a'' or 'Necklace of Sarasvat\u012b'.<ref>R.

This makes no mention of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101, noting only the ''Akl ka kua'' or \"Well of Wisdom\" in front of the tomb of Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn. Kincaid was a cynical observer but in any case the absence of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 in his text indicates was \"no living tradition about the Bhoj\u0101l\u0101 in the middle decades of the nineteenth century\" among those with whom he interacted.<ref name=willis136>{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dh\u0101r, Bhoja and Sarasvat\u012b: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=1 | year=2012 | pages=136\u2013138 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}</ref>\n\n==Sarasvat\u012b==\n[[File:Goddess Ambika from Dhar.JPG|thumb|Goddess Ambik\u0101 from Dh\u0101r, whose inscription mentions V\u0101gdev\u012b.
