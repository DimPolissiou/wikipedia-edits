She is a multi-instrumentalist solo artist, band member, producer, and studio musician.\n\n== Releases ==\n\n=== The Only Girl In The Room (2015) ===\nOn her debut EP, \"The Only Girl in the Room,\" Heidi Lynne Gluck rummages through a collection of battered and beautiful sounds that explore the ideas of family and where home truly is. She also tackles the more contentious issues of how a woman comes into a sense of self and other obstacles that come from the world around her. Her lyrics are occasionally barbed but still manage not to keep you at an arm\u2019s length. She surrounds herself with gossamer guitar lines backed against a folksy rhythmic gait; there are also interludes of juke joint piano and a host of expressive arrangements that give her voice the platform from which to rise, sustain and become a defiant force on behalf of her listeners.\n\n=== Pony Show (2016) ===\n\"Pony Show,\" was produced, composed, and recorded by Gluck. Her sophisticated arrangements provide a strong foundation for melancholy lyrics sung with a delicate, self-assured and authentic voice.

She is a multi-instrumentalist solo artist, band member, producer, and studio musician.\n\n== Releases ==\n\n=== The Only Girl In The Room (2015) ===\nOn her debut EP, \"The Only Girl in the Room,\" Heidi Lynne Gluck rummages through a collection of battered and beautiful sounds that explore the ideas of family and where home truly is. She also tackles the more contentious issues of how a woman comes into a sense of self and other obstacles that come from the world around her. Her lyrics are occasionally barbed but still manage not to keep you at an arm\u2019s length. She surrounds herself with gossamer guitar lines backed against a folksy rhythmic gait; there are also interludes of juke joint piano and a host of expressive arrangements that give her voice the platform from which to rise, sustain and become a defiant force on behalf of her listeners.\n\n=== Pony Show (2016) ===\n\"Pony Show,\" was produced, composed, and recorded by Gluck. Her sophisticated arrangements provide a strong foundation for melancholy lyrics sung with a delicate, self-assured and authentic voice. Born in Manitoba, Canada, Gluck\u2019s songwriting carries forth the tradition of her heroes and fellow Canadian exports, her Holy Trinity: Leonard, Joni, and Neil. Heidi\u2019s production and arrangements are informed by their Laurel Canyon migration as well as the more orchestrated pop recordings of the 60s and 70s.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Year'''\n|'''Album Title'''\n|'''Artist'''\n|'''Instruments Played'''\n|-\n|2016\n|Pony Show, Heidi Lynne Gluck\n|Heidi Lynne Gluck\n|Songwriter, bass, guitars, vocals, keys, lap steel, piano, accordion, drums, engineer\n|-\n|2016\n|Untitled (In production), Gentleman Caller\n|Gentleman Caller\n|Vocals\n|-\n|2016\n|Untitled (In production), Matt Pryor\n|Matt Pryor\n|Piano, vocals, slide guitar, accordion\n|-\n|2016\n|Untitled (In production), Simrit\n|Simrit\n|Bass, guitar, piano\n|-\n|2015\n|The Only Girl In The Room, Heidi Lynne Gluck\n|Heidi Lynne Gluck\n|Songwriter, bass, guitars, vocals, keys, lap steel, piano, accordion, drums, engineer\n|-\n|2015\n|Superhero, David England\n|David England\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano, guitar\n|-\n|2015\n|Downtown In The Dark, Gentleman Caller\n|Gentleman Caller\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano, slide guitar\n|-\n|2015\n|From The Ancient Storm, Simrit\n|Simrit\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano\n|-\n|2014\n|Fumes, Lily & Madeleine\n|Lily & Madeleine\n|Bass, keys, piano, guitar, songwriter\n|-\n|2014\n|Slingshot To Heaven, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's\n|Margot & the Nuclear So and Sos\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano, melodica\n|-\n|2014\n|Simrit (s/t)\n|Simrit\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano, guitar\n|-\n|2014\n|Permeable Life, Carrie Newcomer\n|Carrie Newcomer\n|Bass, vocals, keys, lap steel, piano, accordion\n|-\n|2013\n|Strange Stains, Berwanger\n|Berwanger\n|Bass, vocals, lap steel\n|-\n|2013\n|Lily & Madeleine (s/t)\n|Lily & Madeleine\n|Bass, vocals, lap steel, piano, keys\n|-\n|2012\n|Rot Gut, Domestic, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's\n|Margot & the Nuclear So and Sos\n|Vocals\n|-\n|2012\n|Locked Doors & Pretty Fences, Joel Henderson\n|Joel Henderson\n|Bass, vocals, piano\n|-\n|2008\n|Cinnamon Girl (Neil Young Tribute), Various Artists\n|Various Artists\n|Bass, vocals, guitar, keys, piano\n|-\n|2007\n|Keeper Of Youth, Berwanger\n|The Only Children\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano\n|-\n|2007\n|Limbeck, (s/t)\n|Limbeck\n|Vocals\n|-\n|2006\n|Musical Family Tree: Delicious Berries, Various Artists\n|Various Artists\n|Bass, guitar, vocals, keys, songwriter\n|-\n|2006\n|Crushing Love, Some Girls\n|Some Girls\n|Bass, guitar, vocals, keys, piano, songwriter\n|-\n|2004\n|Change Of Living, Berwanger\n|The Only Children\n|Vocals, accordion\n|-\n|2004\n|In The Garden, Courtney Kaiser\n|Courtney Kaiser\n|Bass, vocals\n|-\n|2003\n|Feel It, Some Girls\n|Some Girls\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano, harmonica\n|-\n|2003\n|The Pieces, (s/t)\n|The Pieces\n|Bass, vocals, keys, piano, songwriter\n|-\n|2002\n|Baby's Breadth, June Panic\n|June Panic\n|Keys, lap steel, piano, vocals\n|-\n|2002\n|Music For Picnics, Sophia Travis\n|Sophia Travis\n|Bass, vocals, lap steel\n|-\n|2002\n|EP Series: PI, I2, E3, C4, E5, S6, The Pieces\n|The Pieces\n|Vocals, bass, keys, guitar, lap steel.\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n[[Some Girls (band)]]\n\n[[Margot & the Nuclear So and So's]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

Grimaud tells him to send his brother and be damned.\n\nA few nights later, a visitor concealing his identity with a false face arrives at Grimaud's house and is shown up to his study by the housekeeper, Mme Dumont. Grimaud's secretary, positioned with a view of the study door, sees Grimaud greet the visitor and let him in; he continues to watch until a shot is heard. Inside the room, Grimaud is found to be dying; but neither visitor nor weapon can be found, and there is unbroken snow outside the only window. On his deathbed, Grimaud makes a confusing statement confirming that his brother was responsible.\n\nGideon Fell discovers that before Grimaud settled in London he was known as Koroly Grimaud Horv\u00e1th, and that he had two brothers, one of whom now calls himself Fley. The three had, years earlier, tried to escape a Transylvanian labour camp by faking their own deaths and being buried alive in their coffins.\n\nA newspaper reports that minutes after Grimaud's shooting witnesses saw Fley walking alone down a snow-covered [[cul-de-sac]], and heard a voice shout \"The second bullet is for you!\" followed by a gunshot. Fley is found dead in the snow with the revolver that killed him (and Grimaud) lying nearby. There are no tracks in the snow but his.\n\nWord is received from Transylvania that the three brothers had been imprisoned for bank robbery, and that after escaping his coffin Grimaud had deliberately left the other two to die. Fley had been saved and returned to prison, but the third brother had perished.\n\nFell reveals that Fley had been blackmailing Grimaud and threatening to disclose his part in the third brother's death. It was in fact Grimaud who had in retaliation been planning to kill Fley, not vice versa. Grimaud's elaborate plan had been to create the illusion that Fley had gone into the study, fired at him, then escaped from the window and returned to his own flat to commit suicide. \n\nIn reality, Grimaud went to Fley's falt, shot him, posed him as a suicide with the gun in his hand, then put on a cardboard overcoat and mask ready to impersonate his own visitor. But his plan went awry as Fley had not been killed outright, and managed to get out into the street to seek a doctor. When Grimauld accidentally showed himself, Fley screamed \"The second bullet is for you!\" and fired, dying from the effort. Though wounded, Grimaud managed to return to his own house and proceeded with his plan. He had previously positioned a large mirror just inside the study door, and as the door was opened he removed his hat (and mask) making it appear to the watching secretary that he was already in the room and was coming forward to greet his visitor. Once inside, he burned the cardboard items and hid the heavy mirror up in the chimney, the effort bringing on a final haemorrhage. He had just enough time to set off a firecracker to fake a gunshot.\n\nThe seeming impossibility of the crimes arose entirely by accident. Fley's shooting appeared to happen some minutes after Grimaud's because of an incorrectly-set clock in a shop window; and Grimaud had not anticipated snow, making Fley's purported escape from the window impossible. \n\nMme Dumont (now revealed to be Grimaud's accomplice and lover) confirms the correctness of Fell's solution, and kills herself.\n\n== Principal characters ==\n\n* Dr Gideon Fell: investigator\n* Professor Charles Vernet Grimaud (Koroly Grimaud Horv\u00e1th)\n* Rosette Grimaud: his daughter\n* Pierre Fley: his brother; illusionist\n* Mme Ernestine Dumont: Grimaud's housekeeper\n* Stuart Mills: Grimaud's secretary\n* Hubert Drayman: Grimaud's bookkeeper\n* Anthony Pettir: collector of ghost stories\n* Jerome Burnaby: amateur criminologist\n* Boyd Mangan: journalist\n\n==Locked room lecture==\nThe novel has become noteworthy for the \"locked room lecture\" of chapter 17, Dr Fell's explanation to the reader of the various ways a person can commit a near-[[perfect murder (fiction)|perfect murder]] in an apparently locked room or otherwise impossible situation. In their ''Catalogue of Crime'' (2nd edn 1982), Barzun and Taylor note that this lecture is very good indeed: \"twenty pages of sound reasoning and fine imagination in lively words\".{{sfn|Barzun|1989|pp=109-110}} They consider that the book deserves a permanent place on one's shelf for this lecture alone.{{sfn|Barzun|1989|pp=109-110}}\n\nIn ''The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books'' (2017) [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]] called this chapter, in which Dr Fell admits candidly that he is a character in a novel, \"an extraordinarily bold move\". Edwards notes that the chapter has been reprinted many times as a stand-alone essay and that its analysis of various locked room scenarios has never been surpassed.{{sfn|Edwards|2017|pp=82-83}}\n==Literary significance and criticism==\nBarzun and Taylor liked the story itself rather less than the lecture. While acknowledging that the plot is ingenious, they considered the characters to be \"not even credible puppets\" and Dr Fell to be \"a dull dog\". They also criticised the excessive problems of impossibility, and the need for the reader to accept \"one hairline adjustment after another\".{{sfn|Barzun|1989|pp=109-110}}\n\nMany other critics took a completely different view, and the book was selected in 1981 as the best [[locked room mystery]] of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysteryfile.com/Locked_Rooms/Library.html|title=Ranking of Impossible Crimes by Experts|website=MysteryFile.com}}</ref> Martin Edwards in 2017 called the book \"remarkably assured\", with a dazzling first paragraph.

Fley is found dead in the snow with the revolver that killed him (and Grimaud) lying nearby. There are no tracks in the snow but his.\n\nWord is received from Transylvania that the three brothers had been imprisoned for bank robbery, and that after escaping his coffin Grimaud had deliberately left the other two to die. Fley had been saved and returned to prison, but the third brother had perished.\n\nFell reveals that Fley had been blackmailing Grimaud and threatening to disclose his part in the third brother's death. It was in fact Grimaud who had in retaliation been planning to kill Fley, not vice versa. Grimaud's elaborate plan had been to create the illusion that Fley had gone into the study, fired at him, then escaped from the window and returned to his own flat to commit suicide. \n\nIn reality, Grimaud went to Fley's falt, shot him, posed him as a suicide with the gun in his hand, then put on a cardboard overcoat and mask ready to impersonate his own visitor. But his plan went awry as Fley had not been killed outright, and managed to get out into the street to seek a doctor. When Grimauld accidentally showed himself, Fley screamed \"The second bullet is for you!\" and fired, dying from the effort. Though wounded, Grimaud managed to return to his own house and proceeded with his plan. He had previously positioned a large mirror just inside the study door, and as the door was opened he removed his hat (and mask) making it appear to the watching secretary that he was already in the room and was coming forward to greet his visitor. Once inside, he burned the cardboard items and hid the heavy mirror up in the chimney, the effort bringing on a final haemorrhage. He had just enough time to set off a firecracker to fake a gunshot.\n\nThe seeming impossibility of the crimes arose entirely by accident. Fley's shooting appeared to happen some minutes after Grimaud's because of an incorrectly-set clock in a shop window; and Grimaud had not anticipated snow, making Fley's purported escape from the window impossible. \n\nMme Dumont (now revealed to be Grimaud's accomplice and lover) confirms the correctness of Fell's solution, and kills herself.\n\n== Principal characters ==\n\n* Dr Gideon Fell: investigator\n* Professor Charles Vernet Grimaud (Koroly Grimaud Horv\u00e1th)\n* Rosette Grimaud: his daughter\n* Pierre Fley: his brother; illusionist\n* Mme Ernestine Dumont: Grimaud's housekeeper\n* Stuart Mills: Grimaud's secretary\n* Hubert Drayman: Grimaud's bookkeeper\n* Anthony Pettir: collector of ghost stories\n* Jerome Burnaby: amateur criminologist\n* Boyd Mangan: journalist\n\n==Locked room lecture==\nThe novel has become noteworthy for the \"locked room lecture\" of chapter 17, Dr Fell's explanation to the reader of the various ways a person can commit a near-[[perfect murder (fiction)|perfect murder]] in an apparently locked room or otherwise impossible situation. In their ''Catalogue of Crime'' (2nd edn 1982), Barzun and Taylor note that this lecture is very good indeed: \"twenty pages of sound reasoning and fine imagination in lively words\".{{sfn|Barzun|1989|pp=109-110}} They consider that the book deserves a permanent place on one's shelf for this lecture alone.{{sfn|Barzun|1989|pp=109-110}}\n\nIn ''The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books'' (2017) [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]] called this chapter, in which Dr Fell admits candidly that he is a character in a novel, \"an extraordinarily bold move\". Edwards notes that the chapter has been reprinted many times as a stand-alone essay and that its analysis of various locked room scenarios has never been surpassed.{{sfn|Edwards|2017|pp=82-83}}\n==Literary significance and criticism==\nBarzun and Taylor liked the story itself rather less than the lecture. While acknowledging that the plot is ingenious, they considered the characters to be \"not even credible puppets\" and Dr Fell to be \"a dull dog\". They also criticised the excessive problems of impossibility, and the need for the reader to accept \"one hairline adjustment after another\".{{sfn|Barzun|1989|pp=109-110}}\n\nMany other critics took a completely different view, and the book was selected in 1981 as the best [[locked room mystery]] of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysteryfile.com/Locked_Rooms/Library.html|title=Ranking of Impossible Crimes by Experts|website=MysteryFile.com}}</ref> Martin Edwards in 2017 called the book \"remarkably assured\", with a dazzling first paragraph.
