Such terms may often be used incorrectly.

This rise is thought to fall to between 10% and 17%. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the percentage of women who find new jobs, which falls between 6% and 11%.

Although this legislation thus appears to have minimal effect on women choosing to take leave, it does appear to increase the time women take in leave.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nMaternity leave legislation could pose benefits or harm to employers. The main potential drawback of mandated leave is its potential to disrupt productive activities by raising rates of employee absenteeism. With mandated leave for a certain period of time and facing prolonged absence of the mothers in the workplace, firms will be faced with two options: hire a temp (which could involve training costs) or function with a missing employee. Alternatively, these policies could be positive for employers who previously did not offer leave because they were worried about attracting employees who were disproportionately likely to use maternity leave. Thus, there is potential for these policies to correct [[market failure]]s.<ref name=\":0\"/> A drawback of rising leave at the societal level, however, is the resulting decrease in female labor supply. In countries with a high demand for labor, including many present-day countries with aging populations, a smaller labor supply is unfavorable.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nSomething important to note for all the research cited above is that the results typically depend on how leave coverage is defined, and whether the policies are for unpaid or paid leave.

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/43488388</ref> While uncommon on a world scale, some countries do reserve parts of the paid leave for the father, meaning it can't be transferred to the mother and lapses unless he uses it. Among the earliest countries to actively push for increased usage of paternity leave are the Nordic welfare states, starting with Sweden making parental leave gender neutral in 1974 and soon followed by Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Finland. These countries lack a unified concept of paternity leave, each imposing different conditions, ratios and timescales, but are regarded as among the most generous in the world.\n\nPartly in an initiative to combat the \"[[Motherhood penalty]],\" [[Norway]] in 1993 initiated a policy change to incentivize [[Fathers rights movement#Parental leave|paternal leave]], the so-called \"[[father's quota]]\", and Sweden followed suit in 1995. This means a certain number of parental leave-days can only be used by the father, and are otherwise lost. In countries in which leave entitlements include a father's quota, there has been a pronounced impact, with the quota being credited for increasing paternal involvement and challenging gender roles within the family, promoting a more equal division of labor.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ronsen|first=Marit|last2=Kitterod|first2=Ragni Hege|date=July 2014|title=Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence from Norway|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=21|pages=59\u201389|doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}</ref> To evaluate this change, R\u00f8nsen & Kitter\u00f8d looked at the rate and timing of women's return to work after giving birth, and the effect on this of the new parental leave policy.

If substitute goods, mothers are able to return to work sooner as fathers take some of the childcare responsibility. Research has suggested a class element is at play: middle class fathers consider themselves a suitable alternative to the mother as primary caregiver, while working-class men may see themselves more as supporters of their partner during her leave. Consequently, middle class fathers may be more likely to use their allotment of leave right after the mother returns to work, while working class fathers may opt to take their leave during the mother's leave.<ref>[[Berit Brandth|Brandth, B.]], & [[Elin Kvande|Kvande, E.]] (2016).

Maternity leave refers to the legal protection given to the mother immediately after she gives birth (but may also include a period before the birth), paternity leave to legal protection given to the father immediately after the mother gives birth, and parental leave to protected time for childcare (usually for either parent) either after the maternity/paternity leave or immediately after birth (for example when the parent is not eligible for maternity/paternity leave, and/or where the time is calculated until the child is a specific age\u2014therefore excluding maternity/paternity leave\u2014usually such jurisdictions protect the job until the child reaches a specific age.)<ref>e.g. in [[Czech Republic]]: \"Section 196 Parental Leave reads: \"In order to extend the care being given to a child, the employer shall grant a female or male employee parental leave if so requested (applied for). Parental leave is granted to the mother of a child upon termination of her maternity leave and to the father of a child from the day when the child is born and it is granted within the scope as requested (as applied for), but '''no longer than until the day when the child reaches the age of three years'''.\" [http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/3221/labour_code.pdf#]</ref> Others allow the parental leave to be transferred into part-time work time. Parental leave is generally available to either parent, except where specified. Leave marked \"Unpaid\" indicates the job is protected for the duration of the leave. Different countries have different rules regarding eligibility for leave and how long a parent has to have worked at their place of employment prior to giving birth before they are eligible for paid leave. In the [[European Union]], the policies vary significantly by country\u2014with regard to length, to payment, and to how parental leave relates to prior maternity leave\u2014but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=2 | [[Country]]\n! colspan=2 | Maternity leave\n! colspan=2 | Paternity leave\n! colspan=2 | Parental{{efn|Either parent}} leave\n! rowspan=2 | Source of payment\n|-\n!

Comparing the length of ''maternity leave'' (which is common in international rankings) may say very little about the situation of a family in a specific country.

This rise is thought to fall to between 10% and 17%. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the percentage of women who find new jobs, which falls between 6% and 11%. Thus, such legislation appears to increase how many women return to work post-childbirth by around 3% or 4%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Baum II|first=Charles L.|date=April 2003|title=The Effects of Maternity Leave Legislation on Mothers' Labor Supply after Childbirth|jstor=1061651|journal=Southern Economic Journal|volume=69|issue=4|pages=772\u2013799|doi=10.2307/1061651}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, it appears that parental leave policies do allow women to stay home longer before returning to work as the probability of returning to an old job falls in the second month after childbirth before dramatically rising in the third month. Although this legislation thus appears to have minimal effect on women choosing to take leave, it does appear to increase the time women take in leave.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nMaternity leave legislation could pose benefits or harm to employers. The main potential drawback of mandated leave is its potential to disrupt productive activities by raising rates of employee absenteeism. With mandated leave for a certain period of time and facing prolonged absence of the mothers in the workplace, firms will be faced with two options: hire a temp (which could involve training costs) or function with a missing employee. Alternatively, these policies could be positive for employers who previously did not offer leave because they were worried about attracting employees who were disproportionately likely to use maternity leave. Thus, there is potential for these policies to correct [[market failure]]s.<ref name=\":0\"/> A drawback of rising leave at the societal level, however, is the resulting decrease in female labor supply. In countries with a high demand for labor, including many present-day countries with aging populations, a smaller labor supply is unfavorable.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nSomething important to note for all the research cited above is that the results typically depend on how leave coverage is defined, and whether the policies are for unpaid or paid leave. Policies guaranteeing paid leave are considered by some to be dramatically more effective than unpaid-leave policies.<ref name=\"HanWaldfogel\"/>\n\nFor women individually, long breaks in employment, as would come from parental leave, negatively affects their careers. Longer gaps are associated with reduced lifetime earnings and lower pension disbursements as well as worsened career prospects and reduced earnings. Due to these drawbacks, some countries, notably Norway, have expanded family policy initiatives to increase the father's quota and expand childcare in an effort to work towards greater gender equality.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nAccording to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks led mothers to spend more time at home without a reduction in family income.<ref name=\"What is the case\">{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Gordon B.|last2=L\u00f8ken|first2=Katrine V.|last3=Mogstad|first3=Magne|last4=Salvanes|first4=Kari Vea|date=2016-03-23|title=What Is the Case for Paid Maternity Leave?|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=98|issue=4|pages=655\u2013670|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00602|issn=0034-6535|hdl=10419/90025|url=http://ekstern.filer.uib.no/svf/2013/WP9.13.pdf}}</ref>\n[[File:Girl-1641215 1920.jpg|alt=|thumb|Father spending time with daughter]]\n\n==== Paternity leave and its effects ====\n\nAlthough parental leave is increasingly granted to fathers, mothers continue to take the majority of guaranteed parental leave.<ref name=\"Ruhm\"/> When guaranteed leave is unpaid, research indicates that men's leave usage is unaffected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=J|last2=Han|first2=WJ|date=February 2003|title=Parental leave: the impact of recent legislation on parents' leave taking|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=40|issue=1|pages=191\u2013200|pmid=12647520|doi=10.1353/dem.2003.0003}}</ref> In Germany, where parental leave is guaranteed for both parents, the financial incentive, alone, was not enough to encourage fathers to take paternal leave.<ref>VOGL, S., & KRELL, C.

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/43488388</ref> While uncommon on a world scale, some countries do reserve parts of the paid leave for the father, meaning it can't be transferred to the mother and lapses unless he uses it. Among the earliest countries to actively push for increased usage of paternity leave are the Nordic welfare states, starting with Sweden making parental leave gender neutral in 1974 and soon followed by Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Finland. These countries lack a unified concept of paternity leave, each imposing different conditions, ratios and timescales, but are regarded as among the most generous in the world.\n\nPartly in an initiative to combat the \"[[Motherhood penalty]],\" [[Norway]] in 1993 initiated a policy change to incentivize [[Fathers rights movement#Parental leave|paternal leave]], the so-called \"[[father's quota]]\", and Sweden followed suit in 1995. This means a certain number of parental leave-days can only be used by the father, and are otherwise lost. In countries in which leave entitlements include a father's quota, there has been a pronounced impact, with the quota being credited for increasing paternal involvement and challenging gender roles within the family, promoting a more equal division of labor.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ronsen|first=Marit|last2=Kitterod|first2=Ragni Hege|date=July 2014|title=Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence from Norway|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=21|pages=59\u201389|doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}</ref> To evaluate this change, R\u00f8nsen & Kitter\u00f8d looked at the rate and timing of women's return to work after giving birth, and the effect on this of the new parental leave policy.

If substitute goods, mothers are able to return to work sooner as fathers take some of the childcare responsibility. Research has suggested a class element is at play: middle class fathers consider themselves a suitable alternative to the mother as primary caregiver, while working-class men may see themselves more as supporters of their partner during her leave. Consequently, middle class fathers may be more likely to use their allotment of leave right after the mother returns to work, while working class fathers may opt to take their leave during the mother's leave.<ref>[[Berit Brandth|Brandth, B.]], & [[Elin Kvande|Kvande, E.]] (2016).

Maternity leave refers to the legal protection given to the mother immediately after she gives birth (but may also include a period before the birth), paternity leave to legal protection given to the father immediately after the mother gives birth, and parental leave to protected time for childcare (usually for either parent) either after the maternity/paternity leave or immediately after birth (for example when the parent is not eligible for maternity/paternity leave, and/or where the time is calculated until the child is a specific age\u2014therefore excluding maternity/paternity leave\u2014usually such jurisdictions protect the job until the child reaches a specific age.)<ref>e.g. in [[Czech Republic]]: \"Section 196 Parental Leave reads: \"In order to extend the care being given to a child, the employer shall grant a female or male employee parental leave if so requested (applied for). Parental leave is granted to the mother of a child upon termination of her maternity leave and to the father of a child from the day when the child is born and it is granted within the scope as requested (as applied for), but '''no longer than until the day when the child reaches the age of three years'''.\" [http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/3221/labour_code.pdf#]</ref> Others allow the parental leave to be transferred into part-time work time. Parental leave is generally available to either parent, except where specified. Leave marked \"Unpaid\" indicates the job is protected for the duration of the leave. Different countries have different rules regarding eligibility for leave and how long a parent has to have worked at their place of employment prior to giving birth before they are eligible for paid leave. In the [[European Union]], the policies vary significantly by country\u2014with regard to length, to payment, and to how parental leave relates to prior maternity leave\u2014but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=2 | [[Country]]\n! colspan=2 | Maternity leave\n! colspan=2 | Paternity leave\n! colspan=2 | Parental{{efn|Either parent}} leave\n! rowspan=2 | Source of payment\n|-\n!

The player controls Terry, a green bouncing sphere, on a quest to recover his magic crystals that have been stolen by Baron von Bonsai. To do so, he must travel through the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, avoiding enemies and hazards while collecting all of the crystals within the game's time limit. The game was developed by Dene Carter at Logotron, with sounds and music composed by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]].\n\nMost editions were priced at \u00a324.99 upon their release, except for the Commodore 64 ports, which were less expensive. Reception for the Amiga version was generally positive, but was more mixed for the Commodore 64 port. Most reviews, however, praised the graphics and gameplay and criticized the difficulty and the amount of content that was available for the price. A less expensive re-release for Amiga computers a year later, at \u00a37.99, also received mixed reviews.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Cloudkingdoms crystal world c64.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot from the Commodore 64 version of ''Cloud Kingdoms'']]\n''Cloud Kingdoms'' is an arcade [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] where the player controls the character of Terry, a green bouncing sphere with eyes, in his quest to recover his magic crystals that were stolen by the game's antagonist, Baron von Bonsai. The crystals have been scattered across a series of levels, the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, which Terry must conquer in order to win the game. The player navigates Terry through each Kingdom from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]] and can move in eight directions, as well as jump over enemies, obstacles, and holes. Enemies include fairies that have been transformed into insects and {{Cuegloss|Black ball|black balls}} by Baron von Bonsai. There are 15 Kingdoms in the [[Commodore 64]] version and 32 in all others.<ref name=\"Zzap\">{{cite journal|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = [[Zzap!64]]|issue = 61|page = 14|publisher = [[Newsfield]]|location = [[Ludlow]]|date = May 1990}}</ref>\n\nPlayers begin the game with a preset choice of four Kingdoms to begin with, with each leading to four other kingdoms that are opened up once the level is won. The objective in each Kingdom is to collect all of the crystals and maneuver through hazards such as trap doors, slippery floors, magnet floors that prevent Terry from jumping, and pinball bumpers. The game overall has a time limit of 99 \"Manukas\", each of which is equivalent to approximately four seconds.<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> Contact with lava fields<ref name=\"PowerPlay\">{{cite journal|last = Locker|first = Anatol|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = Power Play|page = 102|publisher = [[Future plc]]|location = [[Bath, Somerset]]|date = June 1990|language=de}}</ref> or enemies drains the player's energy and, if all energy is lost, the level is reset and ten Manukas are subtracted from the remaining total. The level can also be restarted voluntarily, at the cost of five Manukas. When the Manuka counter reaches zero, the game ends. Collecting clocks will add five Manukas to the timer, while successfully completing a Kingdom will add twenty. Energy can be restored by collecting soda bottles, while shields will make Terry invincible to enemies for a short period. Other items include wings, which allow Terry to fly over all obstacles, paint cans, which allow him to fill in holes and trap doors,<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> and alcohol bottles that temporarily make the gameplay more difficult by altering some of the mechanics.<ref name=\"TheOne\">{{cite journal|last = Hamza|first = Kati|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = [[The One (magazine)|The One]]|issue = 211|pages = 81|publisher = [[Ascential|EMAP]]|location = [[London]]|date = June 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\n''Cloud Kingdoms'' was developed at [[Guerrilla Cambridge|Logotron]]<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> by Dene Carter, who had previously worked on ''[[Druid (video game)|Druid]]'' and its sequel ''Enlightenment'' for the Commodore 64, as well as ''[[Dragon Lord (video game)|Dragon Lord]]''.

The player controls Terry, a green bouncing sphere, on a quest to recover his magic crystals that have been stolen by Baron von Bonsai. To do so, he must travel through the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, avoiding enemies and hazards while collecting all of the crystals within the game's time limit. The game was developed by Dene Carter at Logotron, with sounds and music composed by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]].\n\nMost editions were priced at \u00a324.99 upon their release, except for the Commodore 64 ports, which were less expensive. Reception for the Amiga version was generally positive, but was more mixed for the Commodore 64 port. Most reviews, however, praised the graphics and gameplay and criticized the difficulty and the amount of content that was available for the price. A less expensive re-release for Amiga computers a year later, at \u00a37.99, also received mixed reviews.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Cloudkingdoms crystal world c64.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot from the Commodore 64 version of ''Cloud Kingdoms'']]\n''Cloud Kingdoms'' is an arcade [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] where the player controls the character of Terry, a green bouncing sphere with eyes, in his quest to recover his magic crystals that were stolen by the game's antagonist, Baron von Bonsai. The crystals have been scattered across a series of levels, the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, which Terry must conquer in order to win the game. The player navigates Terry through each Kingdom from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]] and can move in eight directions, as well as jump over enemies, obstacles, and holes. Enemies include fairies that have been transformed into insects and {{Cuegloss|Black ball|black balls}} by Baron von Bonsai. There are 15 Kingdoms in the [[Commodore 64]] version and 32 in all others.<ref name=\"Zzap\">{{cite journal|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = [[Zzap!64]]|issue = 61|page = 14|publisher = [[Newsfield]]|location = [[Ludlow]]|date = May 1990}}</ref>\n\nPlayers begin the game with a preset choice of four Kingdoms to begin with, with each leading to four other kingdoms that are opened up once the level is won. The objective in each Kingdom is to collect all of the crystals and maneuver through hazards such as trap doors, slippery floors, magnet floors that prevent Terry from jumping, and pinball bumpers. The game overall has a time limit of 99 \"Manukas\", each of which is equivalent to approximately four seconds.<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> Contact with lava fields<ref name=\"PowerPlay\">{{cite journal|last = Locker|first = Anatol|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = Power Play|page = 102|publisher = [[Future plc]]|location = [[Bath, Somerset]]|date = June 1990|language=de}}</ref> or enemies drains the player's energy and, if all energy is lost, the level is reset and ten Manukas are subtracted from the remaining total. The level can also be restarted voluntarily, at the cost of five Manukas. When the Manuka counter reaches zero, the game ends. Collecting clocks will add five Manukas to the timer, while successfully completing a Kingdom will add twenty. Energy can be restored by collecting soda bottles, while shields will make Terry invincible to enemies for a short period. Other items include wings, which allow Terry to fly over all obstacles, paint cans, which allow him to fill in holes and trap doors,<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> and alcohol bottles that temporarily make the gameplay more difficult by altering some of the mechanics.<ref name=\"TheOne\">{{cite journal|last = Hamza|first = Kati|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = [[The One (magazine)|The One]]|issue = 211|pages = 81|publisher = [[Ascential|EMAP]]|location = [[London]]|date = June 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\n''Cloud Kingdoms'' was developed at [[Guerrilla Cambridge|Logotron]]<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> by Dene Carter, who had previously worked on ''[[Druid (video game)|Druid]]'' and its sequel ''Enlightenment'' for the Commodore 64, as well as ''[[Dragon Lord (video game)|Dragon Lord]]''.
