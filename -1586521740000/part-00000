The cathedral was consecrated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and considered to be one of the finest examples of [[French Gothic architecture]]. Its pioneering use of the [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], its enormous and colourful [[rose windows]], as well as the [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]] and abundance of its [[sculpture|sculptural decoration]] set it apart from the earlier [[Romanesque style]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=46\u201362}} Major components that make Notre Dame stand out include one of the world's largest organs and its immense church bells.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://traveltips.usatoday.com/notre-dame-cathedral-france-3356.html|title=Facts on the Notre Dame Cathedral in France|website=traveltips.usatoday.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral's construction began in 1160 under Bishop [[Maurice de Sully]] and was largely complete by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the following centuries. In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered [[desecration]] during the [[French Revolution]]; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral was the site of the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] and funerals of many [[List of Presidents of France|Presidents of the Republic]].\n\nPopular interest in the cathedral blossomed soon after the publication, in 1831, of [[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' (better known in English as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''). This led to a major restoration project between 1844 and 1864, supervised by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. The [[liberation of Paris]] was celebrated within Notre-Dame in 1944 with the singing of the [[Magnificat]]. Beginning in 1963, the cathedral's fa\u00e7ade was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime. Another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between 1991 and 2000.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/histoire/historique-de-la-construction|title=Historique de la construction|language=fr|access-date=2 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802135015/http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/histoire/historique-de-la-construction|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most widely recognized symbols of the city of Paris and the French nation. As the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Paris]], Notre-Dame contains the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the [[Archbishop of Paris]] ([[Michel Aupetit]]). In 1805, Notre-Dame was given the honorary status of a [[minor basilica]].

In recent years, an increasing number have been given by leading public figures and state-employed academics.\n\nThe cathedral has been progressively stripped of its original decoration and works of art. Several noteworthy examples of Gothic, Baroque, and 19th-century sculptures and a group of 17th- and early 18th-century altarpieces remain in the cathedral's collection. Some of the most important relics in Christendom, including the [[Crown of Thorns]], a [[True Cross|sliver of the true cross]] and a nail from the true cross, are preserved at Notre-Dame.\n\nWhile undergoing renovation and restoration, the roof of Notre-Dame [[Notre-Dame de Paris fire|caught fire]] on the evening of 15 April 2019. Burning for around 15 hours, the cathedral sustained serious damage, including the destruction of the [[fl\u00e8che]] (the timber spirelet over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]]) and most of the lead-covered wooden roof above the stone [[Vaulting|vaulted]] ceiling.<ref name=partofspirecollapses/> Contamination of the site and the nearby environment resulted.<ref>Elian Peltier, James Glanz, Weiyi Cai, Jeremy White, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/14/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-lead.html Notre-Dame\u2019s Toxic Fallout]'', The New York Times, September 14, 2019, with production by Mona Boshnaq, Umi Syam, and Gaia Tripoli.</ref> Following the fire, many proposals were made for modernizing the cathedral's design.

Evidence for this is the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], discovered in 1710. This building was replaced with an [[Early Christian]] [[basilica]]. It is unknown whether this church, dedicated to [[Saint Stephen]], was constructed in the late 4th century and remodeled later, or if it was built in the 7th century from an older church, possibly the cathedral of [[Childebert I]].{{efn|Excavations have failed to accurately determine the architectural history of the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]].

According to [[Robert of Torigni]], the choir was completed in 1177 and the [[high altar]] consecrated on 19 May 1182 by Cardinal Henri de Ch\u00e2teau-Mar\u00e7ay, the Papal legate in Paris, and Maurice de Sully.{{sfn|Delisle|1873|p=68}} The second phase, from 1182 to 1190, concerned the construction of the four sections of the nave behind the choir and its aisles to the height of the [[clerestories]]. It began after the completion of the choir but ended before the final allotted section of the nave was finished. Beginning in 1190, the bases of the fa\u00e7ade were put in place, and the first traverses were completed.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis.fr\"/> [[Heraclius of Caesarea]] called for the [[Third Crusade]] in 1185 from the still-incomplete cathedral.\n\nLouis IX deposited the relics of the passion of Christ, which included the crown of thorns, a nail from the cross and a sliver of the cross, which he had purchased at great expense from the Latin Emperor Baudouin II, in the cathedral during the construction of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]].\n\nThe decision was made to add a [[transepts]] at the choir, where the altar was located, in order to bring more light into the center of the church. The use of simpler four-part rather than six-part rib vaults meant that the roofs were stronger and could be higher. After Bishop Maurice de Sully's death in 1196, his successor, [[Eudes de Sully]] oversaw the completion of the transepts, and continued work on the [[nave]], which was nearing completion at the time of his own death in 1208. By this time, the western fa\u00e7ade was already largely built, though it was not completed until around the mid-1240s. Between 1225 and 1250 the upper gallery of the nave was constructed, along with the two towers on the west fa\u00e7ade.{{sfn|Bruzelius|1987|pp=540\u201369}}\n\nAnother significant change came in the mid-13th century, when the transepts were remodeled in the latest [[Rayonnant]] style; in the late 1240s [[Jean de Chelles]] added a gabled portal to the north transept topped off by a spectacular rose window. Shortly afterward (from 1258) [[Peter of Montereau|Pierre de Montreuil]] executed a similar scheme on the southern transept. Both these transept portals were richly embellished with sculpture; the south portal features scenes from the lives of St Stephen and of various local saints, while the north portal featured the infancy of Christ and the story of Theophilus in the tympanum, with a highly influential statue of the Virgin and Child in the [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]].{{sfn|Williamson|1995}}{{sfn|Bruzelius|1987|pp=540\u201369}} Master builders [[Pierre de Chelles]], {{ill|Jean Ravy|fr}}, Jean le Bouteiller, and {{ill|Raymond du Temple|fr}} succeeded de Chelles and de Montreuil and then each other in the construction of the cathedral. Ravy completed de Chelles's [[rood screen]] and chevet chapels, then began the {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} flying buttresses of the choir. Jean le Bouteiller, Ravy's nephew, succeeded him in 1344 and was himself replaced on his death in 1363 by his deputy, Raymond du Temple.\n\n[[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] opened the first [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] in the cathedral in 1302.\n\nAn important innovation in the 13th century was the introduction of the [[flying buttress]]. Before the buttresses, all of the weight of the roof pressed outward and down to the walls, and the abutments supporting them. With the flying buttress, the weight was carried by the ribs of the vault entirely outside the structure to a series of counter-supports, which were topped with stone pinnacles which gave them greater weight. The buttresses meant that the walls could be higher and thinner, and could have much larger windows. The date of the first buttresses is not known with any great precision beyond an installation date in the 13th century. Art historian [[Andrew Tallon]], however, has argued based on detailed laser scans of the entire structure that the buttresses were part of the original design. According to Tallon, the scans indicate that \"the upper part of the building has not moved one smidgen in 800 years,\"<ref name=Tallon>{{cite magazine|last=Shea|first=Rachel Hartigan|date=16 April 2019| magazine=National Geographic|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150622-andrew-tallon-notre-dame-cathedral-laser-scan-art-history-medieval-gothic/|title=Historian uses lasers to unlock mysteries of Gothic cathedrals|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref> whereas if they were added later some movement from prior to their addition would be expected.

Where, I ask, would they find such a multipartite arrangement of so many lateral vaults, above and below? Where, I ask, would they find such light-filled amenities as the many surrounding chapels?

The [[smoke detector]]s immediately signaled the fire to a cathedral employee, who did not summon the [[fire brigade]] but instead sent a cathedral guard to investigate. Instead of going to the correct attic, the guard was sent to the wrong location, to the attic of the adjoining sacristy, and reported there was no fire. The guard telephoned his supervisor, who did not immediately answer. About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, whereupon the guard's supervisor told him to go to the correct location.

The firemen inside were ordered back down. By this time the fire had spread to the north tower, where the eight bells were located.  The firefighters concentrated their efforts in the tower.  They feared that,  if the bells fell, they could wreck the tower, and endanger the structure of the other tower and the whole cathedral.  They had to ascend a stairway threatened by fire, and to contend with low water pressure for their hoses.  As other firemen watered the stairway and the roof, a team of twenty firemen climbed up the narrow stairway of the south tower, crossed to the north tower, lowered hoses to be connected to fire engines outside the cathedral, and sprayed water on the fire beneath the bells.  By 21:45, they were finally able to bring the fire under control.<ref name=\"New York Times 2019\"/>\nThe main structure was intact; firefighters saved the fa\u00e7ade, towers, walls, buttresses, and stained glass windows.

The original spire was constructed in the 13th century, probably between 1220 and 1230. It was battered, weakened and bent by the wind over five centuries, and finally was removed in 1786. During the 19th-century restoration, Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc decided to recreate it, making a new version of oak covered with lead. The entire spire weighed 750 tons.\n\nFollowing Viollet-le-Duc's plans, the spire was surrounded by copper statues of the twelve [[Apostles]]{{mdashb}}a group of three at each point of the compass.

To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the fa\u00e7ades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|Strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The ''strix'' appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013, {{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows where it might erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy. The central portal of the west fa\u00e7ade is decorated with carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy. The central pillar of the central door of Notre-Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a scepter in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metals into gold.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from fa\u00e7ade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], during the 19th century restoration.\n\n==Stained glass \u2013 rose windows==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:2016-02-23 15-56-57 paris.jpg|The earliest rose window, on the west fa\u00e7ade (about 1225)\nFile:Paris Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame Innen Westliche Rosette 3.jpg|The west rose window (about 1225)\nFile:Gothic-Rayonnant Rose-6.jpg|North rose window (about 1250)\nFile:Paris Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame Innen S\u00fcdliche Rosette 1.jpg|North rose window including lower 18 vertical windows\n</gallery>\n\nThe stained glass windows of Notre-Dame, particularly the three [[rose windows]], are among the most famous features of the cathedral. The west rose window, over the portals, was the first and smallest of the roses in Notre-Dame. It is 9.6 metres in diameter, and was made in about 1225, with the pieces of glass set in a thick circular stone frame. None of the original glass remains in this window; it was recreated in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/554234|title=West rose window of Notre Dame de Paris, Notre Dame Cathedral West Rose Window, Detail, Digital and Special Collections, Georgetown University Library|access-date=5 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805233712/https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/554234|archive-date=5 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two transept windows are larger and contain a greater proportion of glass than the rose on the west fa\u00e7ade, because the new system of buttresses made the nave walls thinner and stronger. The north rose was created in about 1250, and the south rose in about 1260. The south rose in the transept is particularly notable for its size and artistry. It is 12.9 metres in diameter; with the ''claire-voie'' surrounding it, a total of 19 metres. It was given to the Cathedral by King [[Louis IX of France]], known as Saint Louis.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/linterieur/vitraux/rose-sud/|title=The South Rose- official site of Notre Dame de Paris -|language=fr|access-date=3 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803172023/http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/linterieur/vitraux/rose-sud/|archive-date=3 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe south rose has 94 medallions, arranged in four circles, depicting scenes from the life of Christ and those who witnessed his time on earth. The inner circle has twelve medallions showing the twelve apostles. (During later restorations, some of these original medallions were moved to circles farther out). The next two circles depict celebrated martyrs and virgins. The fourth circle shows twenty angels, as well as saints important to Paris, notably Saint [[Denis]], [[Margaret the Virgin]] with a dragon, and [[Saint Eustace]]. The third and fourth circles also have some depictions of [[Old Testament]] subjects. The third circle has some medallions with scenes from the [[New Testament]] Gospel of Matthew which date from the last quarter of the 12th century. These are the oldest glass in the window.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\"/>\n\nAdditional scenes in the corners around the rose window include Jesus' [[The Harrowing of Hell|Descent into Hell]], [[Adam and Eve]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]]. [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]] are at the bottom of the window, and [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[John the Apostle]] at the top.\n\nAbove the rose was a window depicting Christ triumphant seated in the sky, surrounded by his [[Apostles]]. Below are sixteen windows with painted images of Prophets. These were not part of the original window; they were painted during the restoration in the 19th century by Alfred G\u00e9renthe, under the direction of [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], based upon a similar window at [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\"/>\n\nThe south rose had a difficult history. In 1543 it was damaged by the settling of the masonry walls, and not restored until 1725\u20131727. It was seriously damaged in the [[French Revolution of 1830]]. Rioters burned the residence of the archbishop, next to the cathedral, and many of the panes were destroyed. The window was entirely rebuilt by Viollet-le-Duc in 1861. He rotated the window by fifteen degrees to give it a clear vertical and horizontal axis, and replaced the destroyed pieces of glass with new glass in the same style. The window today contains both medieval and 19th century glass.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, after three decades of debate, it was decided to replace many of the 19th-century grisaille windows in the nave designed by Viollet-le-Duc with new windows. The new windows, made by [[Jacques Le Chevallier]], are without human figures and use abstract ''[[grisaille]]'' designs and color to try to recreate the luminosity of the Cathedral's interior in the 13th century.\n\nThe 2019 fire left the three great medieval rose windows essentially intact, but with some damage.<ref>''Le Figaro'', 17 April 2019</ref> The rector of the Cathedral noted that one rose window would have to be dismantled, as it was unstable and at risk.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> Most of the other damaged windows were of much less historical value.<ref name=\"huffpost\">{{cite news |last1=Guyonnet |first1=Paul |title=Notre-Dame: Les vitraux des rosaces ont surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 l'incendie |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/notre-dame-vitraux-rosaces-incendie_fr_5cb58dece4b082aab08b55e0 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |work=Huffington Post France |date=16 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Crypt==\n[[File:La crypte arch\u00e9ologique du Parvis de Notre-Dame (Paris) (8274683584).jpg|thumb|The Archaeological Crypt of Notre-Dame de Paris]]\n\nThe Archaeological Crypt (Crypte arch\u00e9ologique de l'\u00eele de la Cit\u00e9) was created in 1965 to protect a range of historical ruins discovered during construction work and spanning from the earliest settlement in Paris to the modern day.

During the restoration of the cathedral by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], [[Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll]] built a new organ, using pipe work from the former instruments. The organ was dedicated in 1868.\n\nIn 1904, Charles Mutin modified and added several [[Organ stop|stop]]s; in 1924, an electric blower was installed. An extensive restoration and cleaning was carried out by Joseph Beuchet in 1932. Between 1959 and 1963, the mechanical action with [[Barker lever]]s was replaced with an electric action by Jean Hermann, and a new organ console was installed.\n\nDuring the following years, the stoplist was gradually modified by Robert Boisseau (who added three [[En chamade|chamade stop]]s: 8\u2032, 4\u2032, and 2\u2032/16\u2032 in 1968) and Jean-Loup Boisseau after 1975, respectively. In autumn 1983, the electric combination system was disconnected due to short-circuit risk.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, Jean-Loup Boisseau, Bertrand Cattiaux, Philippe \u00c9meriau, Michel Giroud, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Synaptel revised and augmented the instrument throughout. A new console was installed, using the stop knobs, pedal and manual keyboards, foot pistons and balance pedals from the Jean Hermann console. Between 2012 and 2014, Bertrand Cattiaux and Pascal Quoirin restored, cleaned, and modified the organ. The stop and key action was upgraded, a new console was built, (again using the stop keys, pedal board, foot pistons and balance pedals of the 1992 console), a new enclosed division (\"R\u00e9sonnance expressive\", using pipework from the former \"Petite P\u00e9dale\" by Boisseau, which can now be used as a floating division), the organ case and the fa\u00e7ade pipes were restored, and a general tuning was carried out. The current organ has 115 stops (156 ranks) on five manuals and pedal, and more than 8,000 [[Organ pipe|pipes]].\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 98%\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! I.

The [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]], called Emmanuel, weighing at 13 tons {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} and tuned to F sharp, has been an accompaniment to some of France's major historical events since its first 15th-century casting {{citation needed|date=May 2019}}, such as the coronation of French kings, papal visits, and the end of conflicts such as [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. It also rings in times of sorrow like for the funerals of the French heads of state, tragedies such as the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/what-we-learned-about-america-on-9/11-from-3600-miles-away.html|title=What Being in Paris on 9/11 Taught Us About the Power of Empathy|last=Zetlin|first=Minda|date=September 11, 2016|publisher=Inc.|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref> and on special holidays like [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. It was recast at the request of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] in 1681, and managed to escape the events of the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. \n\nThere were also four bells that replaced those destroyed in the French Revolution. Placed at the top of the North Tower in 1856, these ring daily for basic services, the Angelus and the chiming of the hours. The first of these bells, named Ang\u00e9lique-Fran\u00e7oise, weighs in at 1,915&nbsp;kg and is tuned to C sharp; the next bell is named Antoinette-Charlotte, weighing in at 1,335&nbsp;kg and tuned to D sharp. Then there is the bell named Jacinthe-Jeanne weighing in at 925&nbsp;kg tuned to F and the fourth bell named Denise-David weighs 767&nbsp;kg and just like the Grand Bell Emmanuel, it is tuned to F sharp. A few years later, in 1867, a [[carillon]] of three bells in the spire with two chimes that linked to the monumental clock were put in place and another three bells were positioned in the actual structure of Notre-Dame itself, so that they could be heard inside. However, unfortunately, these are at present mute, although a project is currently being looked at, and hopefully will be put into place, in order to restore the Carillon to its former glory. The four bells that were put in place in 1856 are now stored, as of February 2012.\n\n[[File:Paris for SIAM PP 2016 (36378821523).jpg|thumb|Bourdon Emmanuel]]\n\nAbout a year later, a new set of eight bells for the North Tower of Notre-Dame was being produced, along with a Grand Bell for the South Tower, just as there were originally before most were destroyed during the French Revolution. The construction of bells is one of accuracy and precision to obtain the desired sound and the work has been entrusted to two separate companies, one in France for the eight bells and one in Belgium for the Grand Bell. Each of the new bells is named with names that have been chosen to pay tribute to saints and others who have shaped the life of Paris and the Notre-Dame.\n\nEmmanuel is accompanied by another large bell in the south tower called Marie. At six tonnes and playing a G Sharp, Marie is the second largest bell in the cathedral. Marie is also called a Little Bourdon (petite bourdon) or a drone bell&nbsp;because it is located alongside Emmanuel in the south tower. Built in a foundry in The Netherlands, it has engravings as a very distinctive feature, something which is different compared to the other bells. The phrases \"Je vous salue Marie,\" in French, and \"Via viatores quaerit,\" in Latin, which mean \"Hail Mary\" (where the bell gets its name from the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]) and \"The way is looking for travellers\". Below the phrase appears an image of the Baby [[Jesus]] and his parents surrounded by stars and a relief with the [[Adoration of the Magi]]. It is in charge of the Small Solennel, which is similar to the Great Solennel except that the ringing peal starts with the bourdon and the eight bells in the north tower. This ring is heard on only 1 January (New Year's Day) at the stroke of midnight and it replaces Emmanuel for international events. Like Emmanuel, the bells are used to mark specific moments such as the arrival at the Cathedral of the body of the deceased Archbishop of Paris.\n\nIn the North Tower, there are eight bells varying in size from largest to smallest. Gabriel is the largest bell there; it weighs four tons and plays an A sharp. It is named after [[Gabriel|the Archangel Gabriel]], who announced the birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary. Built in a bell foundry outside Paris in 2013, it also chimes the hour through the day. Like Emmanuel and Marie, Gabriel is used to mark specific events. It is used mainly for masses on Sundays in ordinary times and some solemnities falling during the week in the Plenum North. It shows 40 circular lines representing the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert and the 40 years of Moses' crossing the Sinai.\n\nAnne-Genevi\u00e8ve is the second largest bell in the North Tower and the fourth largest bell in the cathedral. Named after two saints: [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]], Mary's mother, and [[Genevieve|St. Genevi\u00e8ve]] the patron saint of Paris, it plays a B and it weighs three tons. It has three circular lines that represent the Holy Trinity and three theological virtues. Like Emmanuel, Marie and Gabriel, Anne-Genevieve is used to mark specific moments such as the opening of the doors to the [[Palm Sunday]] mass or the body of the deceased Archbishop of Paris. Also it is the only bell that does not participate in a chime called the Angelus Domini, which happens in the summer at 8am, noon and 8pm (or 9am, noon and 9pm).\n\nDenis&nbsp;is the third largest bell in the North Tower and fifth largest bell in the cathedral. It is named after [[Denis|St. Denis]], the martyr who was also the first bishop of Paris around the year 250; it weighs 2 tons and plays a C sharp. This bell includes the third phrase of the Angelus, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord\". There are also seven circular lines representing the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the seven Sacraments.\n\nMarcel&nbsp;is the fourth largest bell in the North Tower and sixth largest bell in the cathedral. It&nbsp;is named after the {{ill|Marcel of Paris|lt=9th bishop of Paris|fr|Marcel de Paris}}. It plays a D sharp and weighs 1.9 tons. It is named after Saint Marcel, the ninth bishop of Paris, known for his tireless service to the poor and sick in the fifth century. The bell that bears his name as a tribute has engraved upon it the fourth sentence of the Angelus, \"Be it done unto me according to Thy word\".\n\n\u00c9tienne is the fifth largest bell in the North Tower and seventh largest bell in the cathedral. It is named after St. \u00c9tienne (English [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]]), the first Christian martyr. It plays an E sharp and weighs 1.5 tons with its most prominent feature being its gold stripe slightly above the nameplate.\n\nBeno\u00eet-Joseph is the sixth largest bell in the North Tower and eighth largest bell in the cathedral. The bell is named in honor of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], using the French version of his [[papal name|pontifical name]] combined with his given name (Joseph). It plays an F and weighs 1.3 tons. It has two silver stripes above the skirt and one silver stripe above the nameplate. This bell is used for weddings and sometimes chimes the hour replacing Gabriel, most likely on a chime called the [[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]].\n\nMaurice is the seventh largest bell in the North Tower and second smallest in the cathedral. It is named after [[Maurice de Sully]], the bishop of Paris who laid the first stone for the construction of the Cathedral. It includes the inscription, \"Pray for us, Holy Mother of God\". It plays a G sharp and weighs one ton. It has two gray stripes below the nameplate. This bell is used for weddings.\n\nJean Marie is the smallest bell of the cathedral. Unlike Beno\u00eet-Joseph and Anne-Genevi\u00e8ve which have two names, it is named after Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]], Paris' bishop from 1981 until 2005, and on it is engraved the eighth and last sentence of the Angelus: \"that we might be made worthy of the promises of Christ\". It plays an A sharp and weighs 0.780 tons. It has a small gray stripe above the skirt. This bell is also used for weddings.\n\n==Ownership==\nUntil the French Revolution, Notre-Dame was the property of the Archbishop of Paris and therefore the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It was nationalized on 2 November 1789 and since then has been the property of the French state.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u00c0 qui appartient la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris?|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/aqui-appartient-la-cathedrale-notre-dame-de-paris-1674259.html|date=16 April 2019|work=[[BFM TV]]|language=fr|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref> Under the Concordat of 1801, use of the cathedral was returned to the Church, but not ownership. Legislation from 1833 and 1838 clarified that cathedrals were maintained at the expense of the French government. This was reaffirmed in [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], designating the Catholic Church as having the exclusive right to use it for religious purposes in perpetuity. Notre-Dame is one of seventy historic churches in France with this status. The archdiocese is responsible for paying the employees, for security, heating and cleaning, and for ensuring that the cathedral is open free to visitors. The archdiocese does not receive subsidies from the French state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Loi du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1905 concernant la s\u00e9paration des Eglises et de l'Etat.|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070169&dateTexte=20080306|language=fr|publisher=Government of France|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref>Communique of the Press and Communication Service of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Paris, November 2014.</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:ZuccaParis11.jpg|Notre-Dame de Paris (1944)\nFile:Paris - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame - Tr\u00e9sor de la cath\u00e9drale - Ornements sacerdotaux -3.JPG|19th-century [[vestments]]\nFile:Notre-dame-looking-up-np.jpg|A wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western fa\u00e7ade\nFile:Notre Dame Paris front facade lower.jpg|Notre-Dame's [[fa\u00e7ade]] showing the Portal of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]], Portal of the [[Last Judgment]], and Portal of [[Saint Anne|St-Anne]]\nFile:Notre dame view from Montparnasse Tower.jpg|A 2010 view of Notre-Dame from [[Tour Montparnasse]]\nFile:Notre Dame de Paris.JPG|A wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western fa\u00e7ade\nFile:Notre dame de paris, statua della nostra signora di parigi.JPG |[[Virgin of Paris]], 14th century.

[[cathedral]] on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris]]. The cathedral was consecrated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and considered to be one of the finest examples of [[French Gothic architecture]]. Its pioneering use of the [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], its enormous and colourful [[rose windows]], as well as the [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]] and abundance of its [[sculpture|sculptural decoration]] set it apart from the earlier [[Romanesque style]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=46\u201362}} Major components that make Notre Dame stand out include one of the world's largest organs and its immense church bells.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://traveltips.usatoday.com/notre-dame-cathedral-france-3356.html|title=Facts on the Notre Dame Cathedral in France|website=traveltips.usatoday.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral's construction began in 1160 under Bishop [[Maurice de Sully]] and was largely complete by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the following centuries. In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered [[desecration]] during the [[French Revolution]]; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral was the site of the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] and funerals of many [[List of Presidents of France|Presidents of the Republic]].\n\nPopular interest in the cathedral blossomed soon after the publication, in 1831, of [[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' (better known in English as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''). This led to a major restoration project between 1844 and 1864, supervised by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. The [[liberation of Paris]] was celebrated within Notre-Dame in 1944 with the singing of the [[Magnificat]]. Beginning in 1963, the cathedral's fa\u00e7ade was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime. Another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between 1991 and 2000.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/histoire/historique-de-la-construction|title=Historique de la construction|language=fr|access-date=2 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802135015/http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/histoire/historique-de-la-construction|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most widely recognized symbols of the city of Paris and the French nation. As the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Paris]], Notre-Dame contains the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the [[Archbishop of Paris]] ([[Michel Aupetit]]). In 1805, Notre-Dame was given the honorary status of a [[minor basilica]].

In recent years, an increasing number have been given by leading public figures and state-employed academics.\n\nThe cathedral has been progressively stripped of its original decoration and works of art. Several noteworthy examples of Gothic, Baroque, and 19th-century sculptures and a group of 17th- and early 18th-century altarpieces remain in the cathedral's collection. Some of the most important relics in Christendom, including the [[Crown of Thorns]], a [[True Cross|sliver of the true cross]] and a nail from the true cross, are preserved at Notre-Dame.\n\nWhile undergoing renovation and restoration, the roof of Notre-Dame [[Notre-Dame de Paris fire|caught fire]] on the evening of 15 April 2019. Burning for around 15 hours, the cathedral sustained serious damage, including the destruction of the [[fl\u00e8che]] (the timber spirelet over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]]) and most of the lead-covered wooden roof above the stone [[Vaulting|vaulted]] ceiling.<ref name=partofspirecollapses/> Contamination of the site and the nearby environment resulted.<ref>Elian Peltier, James Glanz, Weiyi Cai, Jeremy White, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/14/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-lead.html Notre-Dame\u2019s Toxic Fallout]'', The New York Times, September 14, 2019, with production by Mona Boshnaq, Umi Syam, and Gaia Tripoli.</ref> Following the fire, many proposals were made for modernizing the cathedral's design.

Evidence for this is the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], discovered in 1710. This building was replaced with an [[Early Christian]] [[basilica]]. It is unknown whether this church, dedicated to [[Saint Stephen]], was constructed in the late 4th century and remodeled later, or if it was built in the 7th century from an older church, possibly the cathedral of [[Childebert I]].{{efn|Excavations have failed to accurately determine the architectural history of the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]].

According to [[Robert of Torigni]], the choir was completed in 1177 and the [[high altar]] consecrated on 19 May 1182 by Cardinal Henri de Ch\u00e2teau-Mar\u00e7ay, the Papal legate in Paris, and Maurice de Sully.{{sfn|Delisle|1873|p=68}} The second phase, from 1182 to 1190, concerned the construction of the four sections of the nave behind the choir and its aisles to the height of the [[clerestories]]. It began after the completion of the choir but ended before the final allotted section of the nave was finished. Beginning in 1190, the bases of the fa\u00e7ade were put in place, and the first traverses were completed.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis.fr\"/> [[Heraclius of Caesarea]] called for the [[Third Crusade]] in 1185 from the still-incomplete cathedral.\n\nLouis IX deposited the relics of the passion of Christ, which included the crown of thorns, a nail from the cross and a sliver of the cross, which he had purchased at great expense from the Latin Emperor Baudouin II, in the cathedral during the construction of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]].\n\nThe decision was made to add a [[transepts]] at the choir, where the altar was located, in order to bring more light into the center of the church. The use of simpler four-part rather than six-part rib vaults meant that the roofs were stronger and could be higher. After Bishop Maurice de Sully's death in 1196, his successor, [[Eudes de Sully]] oversaw the completion of the transepts, and continued work on the [[nave]], which was nearing completion at the time of his own death in 1208. By this time, the western fa\u00e7ade was already largely built, though it was not completed until around the mid-1240s. Between 1225 and 1250 the upper gallery of the nave was constructed, along with the two towers on the west fa\u00e7ade.{{sfn|Bruzelius|1987|pp=540\u201369}}\n\nAnother significant change came in the mid-13th century, when the transepts were remodeled in the latest [[Rayonnant]] style; in the late 1240s [[Jean de Chelles]] added a gabled portal to the north transept topped off by a spectacular rose window. Shortly afterward (from 1258) [[Peter of Montereau|Pierre de Montreuil]] executed a similar scheme on the southern transept. Both these transept portals were richly embellished with sculpture; the south portal features scenes from the lives of St Stephen and of various local saints, while the north portal featured the infancy of Christ and the story of Theophilus in the tympanum, with a highly influential statue of the Virgin and Child in the [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]].{{sfn|Williamson|1995}}{{sfn|Bruzelius|1987|pp=540\u201369}} Master builders [[Pierre de Chelles]], {{ill|Jean Ravy|fr}}, Jean le Bouteiller, and {{ill|Raymond du Temple|fr}} succeeded de Chelles and de Montreuil and then each other in the construction of the cathedral. Ravy completed de Chelles's [[rood screen]] and chevet chapels, then began the {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} flying buttresses of the choir. Jean le Bouteiller, Ravy's nephew, succeeded him in 1344 and was himself replaced on his death in 1363 by his deputy, Raymond du Temple.\n\n[[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] opened the first [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] in the cathedral in 1302.\n\nAn important innovation in the 13th century was the introduction of the [[flying buttress]]. Before the buttresses, all of the weight of the roof pressed outward and down to the walls, and the abutments supporting them. With the flying buttress, the weight was carried by the ribs of the vault entirely outside the structure to a series of counter-supports, which were topped with stone pinnacles which gave them greater weight. The buttresses meant that the walls could be higher and thinner, and could have much larger windows. The date of the first buttresses is not known with any great precision beyond an installation date in the 13th century. Art historian [[Andrew Tallon]], however, has argued based on detailed laser scans of the entire structure that the buttresses were part of the original design. According to Tallon, the scans indicate that \"the upper part of the building has not moved one smidgen in 800 years,\"<ref name=Tallon>{{cite magazine|last=Shea|first=Rachel Hartigan|date=16 April 2019| magazine=National Geographic|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150622-andrew-tallon-notre-dame-cathedral-laser-scan-art-history-medieval-gothic/|title=Historian uses lasers to unlock mysteries of Gothic cathedrals|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref> whereas if they were added later some movement from prior to their addition would be expected.

The [[smoke detector]]s immediately signaled the fire to a cathedral employee, who did not summon the [[fire brigade]] but instead sent a cathedral guard to investigate. Instead of going to the correct attic, the guard was sent to the wrong location, to the attic of the adjoining sacristy, and reported there was no fire. The guard telephoned his supervisor, who did not immediately answer. About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, whereupon the guard's supervisor told him to go to the correct location.

The firemen inside were ordered back down. By this time the fire had spread to the north tower, where the eight bells were located.  The firefighters concentrated their efforts in the tower.  They feared that,  if the bells fell, they could wreck the tower, and endanger the structure of the other tower and the whole cathedral.  They had to ascend a stairway threatened by fire, and to contend with low water pressure for their hoses.  As other firemen watered the stairway and the roof, a team of twenty firemen climbed up the narrow stairway of the south tower, crossed to the north tower, lowered hoses to be connected to fire engines outside the cathedral, and sprayed water on the fire beneath the bells.  By 21:45, they were finally able to bring the fire under control.<ref name=\"New York Times 2019\"/>\nThe main structure was intact; firefighters saved the fa\u00e7ade, towers, walls, buttresses, and stained glass windows.

The original spire was constructed in the 13th century, probably between 1220 and 1230. It was battered, weakened and bent by the wind over five centuries, and finally was removed in 1786. During the 19th-century restoration, Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc decided to recreate it, making a new version of oak covered with lead. The entire spire weighed 750 tons.\n\nFollowing Viollet-le-Duc's plans, the spire was surrounded by copper statues of the twelve [[Apostles]]{{mdashb}}a group of three at each point of the compass.

To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the fa\u00e7ades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|Strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The ''strix'' appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013, {{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows where it might erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy. The central portal of the west fa\u00e7ade is decorated with carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy. The central pillar of the central door of Notre-Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a scepter in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metals into gold.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from fa\u00e7ade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], during the 19th century restoration.\n\n==Stained glass \u2013 rose windows==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:2016-02-23 15-56-57 paris.jpg|The earliest rose window, on the west fa\u00e7ade (about 1225)\nFile:Paris Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame Innen Westliche Rosette 3.jpg|The west rose window (about 1225)\nFile:Gothic-Rayonnant Rose-6.jpg|North rose window (about 1250)\nFile:Paris Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame Innen S\u00fcdliche Rosette 1.jpg|North rose window including lower 18 vertical windows\n</gallery>\n\nThe stained glass windows of Notre-Dame, particularly the three [[rose windows]], are among the most famous features of the cathedral. The west rose window, over the portals, was the first and smallest of the roses in Notre-Dame. It is 9.6 metres in diameter, and was made in about 1225, with the pieces of glass set in a thick circular stone frame. None of the original glass remains in this window; it was recreated in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/554234|title=West rose window of Notre Dame de Paris, Notre Dame Cathedral West Rose Window, Detail, Digital and Special Collections, Georgetown University Library|access-date=5 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805233712/https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/554234|archive-date=5 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two transept windows are larger and contain a greater proportion of glass than the rose on the west fa\u00e7ade, because the new system of buttresses made the nave walls thinner and stronger. The north rose was created in about 1250, and the south rose in about 1260. The south rose in the transept is particularly notable for its size and artistry. It is 12.9 metres in diameter; with the ''claire-voie'' surrounding it, a total of 19 metres. It was given to the Cathedral by King [[Louis IX of France]], known as Saint Louis.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/linterieur/vitraux/rose-sud/|title=The South Rose- official site of Notre Dame de Paris -|language=fr|access-date=3 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803172023/http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/la-cathedrale/linterieur/vitraux/rose-sud/|archive-date=3 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe south rose has 94 medallions, arranged in four circles, depicting scenes from the life of Christ and those who witnessed his time on earth. The inner circle has twelve medallions showing the twelve apostles. (During later restorations, some of these original medallions were moved to circles farther out). The next two circles depict celebrated martyrs and virgins. The fourth circle shows twenty angels, as well as saints important to Paris, notably Saint [[Denis]], [[Margaret the Virgin]] with a dragon, and [[Saint Eustace]]. The third and fourth circles also have some depictions of [[Old Testament]] subjects. The third circle has some medallions with scenes from the [[New Testament]] Gospel of Matthew which date from the last quarter of the 12th century. These are the oldest glass in the window.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\"/>\n\nAdditional scenes in the corners around the rose window include Jesus' [[The Harrowing of Hell|Descent into Hell]], [[Adam and Eve]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]]. [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]] are at the bottom of the window, and [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[John the Apostle]] at the top.\n\nAbove the rose was a window depicting Christ triumphant seated in the sky, surrounded by his [[Apostles]]. Below are sixteen windows with painted images of Prophets. These were not part of the original window; they were painted during the restoration in the 19th century by Alfred G\u00e9renthe, under the direction of [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], based upon a similar window at [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\"/>\n\nThe south rose had a difficult history. In 1543 it was damaged by the settling of the masonry walls, and not restored until 1725\u20131727. It was seriously damaged in the [[French Revolution of 1830]]. Rioters burned the residence of the archbishop, next to the cathedral, and many of the panes were destroyed. The window was entirely rebuilt by Viollet-le-Duc in 1861. He rotated the window by fifteen degrees to give it a clear vertical and horizontal axis, and replaced the destroyed pieces of glass with new glass in the same style. The window today contains both medieval and 19th century glass.<ref name=\"notredamedeparis\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, after three decades of debate, it was decided to replace many of the 19th-century grisaille windows in the nave designed by Viollet-le-Duc with new windows. The new windows, made by [[Jacques Le Chevallier]], are without human figures and use abstract ''[[grisaille]]'' designs and color to try to recreate the luminosity of the Cathedral's interior in the 13th century.\n\nThe 2019 fire left the three great medieval rose windows essentially intact, but with some damage.<ref>''Le Figaro'', 17 April 2019</ref> The rector of the Cathedral noted that one rose window would have to be dismantled, as it was unstable and at risk.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> Most of the other damaged windows were of much less historical value.<ref name=\"huffpost\">{{cite news |last1=Guyonnet |first1=Paul |title=Notre-Dame: Les vitraux des rosaces ont surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 l'incendie |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/notre-dame-vitraux-rosaces-incendie_fr_5cb58dece4b082aab08b55e0 |accessdate=16 April 2019 |work=Huffington Post France |date=16 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Crypt==\n[[File:La crypte arch\u00e9ologique du Parvis de Notre-Dame (Paris) (8274683584).jpg|thumb|The Archaeological Crypt of Notre-Dame de Paris]]\n\nThe Archaeological Crypt (Crypte arch\u00e9ologique de l'\u00eele de la Cit\u00e9) was created in 1965 to protect a range of historical ruins discovered during construction work and spanning from the earliest settlement in Paris to the modern day.

During the restoration of the cathedral by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], [[Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll]] built a new organ, using pipe work from the former instruments. The organ was dedicated in 1868.\n\nIn 1904, Charles Mutin modified and added several [[Organ stop|stop]]s; in 1924, an electric blower was installed. An extensive restoration and cleaning was carried out by Joseph Beuchet in 1932. Between 1959 and 1963, the mechanical action with [[Barker lever]]s was replaced with an electric action by Jean Hermann, and a new organ console was installed.\n\nDuring the following years, the stoplist was gradually modified by Robert Boisseau (who added three [[En chamade|chamade stop]]s: 8\u2032, 4\u2032, and 2\u2032/16\u2032 in 1968) and Jean-Loup Boisseau after 1975, respectively. In autumn 1983, the electric combination system was disconnected due to short-circuit risk.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, Jean-Loup Boisseau, Bertrand Cattiaux, Philippe \u00c9meriau, Michel Giroud, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Synaptel revised and augmented the instrument throughout. A new console was installed, using the stop knobs, pedal and manual keyboards, foot pistons and balance pedals from the Jean Hermann console. Between 2012 and 2014, Bertrand Cattiaux and Pascal Quoirin restored, cleaned, and modified the organ. The stop and key action was upgraded, a new console was built, (again using the stop keys, pedal board, foot pistons and balance pedals of the 1992 console), a new enclosed division (\"R\u00e9sonnance expressive\", using pipework from the former \"Petite P\u00e9dale\" by Boisseau, which can now be used as a floating division), the organ case and the fa\u00e7ade pipes were restored, and a general tuning was carried out. The current organ has 115 stops (156 ranks) on five manuals and pedal, and more than 8,000 [[Organ pipe|pipes]].\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 98%\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! I.

The [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]], called Emmanuel, weighing at 13 tons {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} and tuned to F sharp, has been an accompaniment to some of France's major historical events since its first 15th-century casting {{citation needed|date=May 2019}}, such as the coronation of French kings, papal visits, and the end of conflicts such as [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. It also rings in times of sorrow like for the funerals of the French heads of state, tragedies such as the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/what-we-learned-about-america-on-9/11-from-3600-miles-away.html|title=What Being in Paris on 9/11 Taught Us About the Power of Empathy|last=Zetlin|first=Minda|date=September 11, 2016|publisher=Inc.|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref> and on special holidays like [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. It was recast at the request of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] in 1681, and managed to escape the events of the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. \n\nThere were also four bells that replaced those destroyed in the French Revolution. Placed at the top of the North Tower in 1856, these ring daily for basic services, the Angelus and the chiming of the hours. The first of these bells, named Ang\u00e9lique-Fran\u00e7oise, weighs in at 1,915&nbsp;kg and is tuned to C sharp; the next bell is named Antoinette-Charlotte, weighing in at 1,335&nbsp;kg and tuned to D sharp. Then there is the bell named Jacinthe-Jeanne weighing in at 925&nbsp;kg tuned to F and the fourth bell named Denise-David weighs 767&nbsp;kg and just like the Grand Bell Emmanuel, it is tuned to F sharp. A few years later, in 1867, a [[carillon]] of three bells in the spire with two chimes that linked to the monumental clock were put in place and another three bells were positioned in the actual structure of Notre-Dame itself, so that they could be heard inside. However, unfortunately, these are at present mute, although a project is currently being looked at, and hopefully will be put into place, in order to restore the Carillon to its former glory. The four bells that were put in place in 1856 are now stored, as of February 2012.\n\n[[File:Paris for SIAM PP 2016 (36378821523).jpg|thumb|Bourdon Emmanuel]]\n\nAbout a year later, a new set of eight bells for the North Tower of Notre-Dame was being produced, along with a Grand Bell for the South Tower, just as there were originally before most were destroyed during the French Revolution. The construction of bells is one of accuracy and precision to obtain the desired sound and the work has been entrusted to two separate companies, one in France for the eight bells and one in Belgium for the Grand Bell. Each of the new bells is named with names that have been chosen to pay tribute to saints and others who have shaped the life of Paris and the Notre-Dame.\n\nEmmanuel is accompanied by another large bell in the south tower called Marie. At six tonnes and playing a G Sharp, Marie is the second largest bell in the cathedral. Marie is also called a Little Bourdon (petite bourdon) or a drone bell&nbsp;because it is located alongside Emmanuel in the south tower. Built in a foundry in The Netherlands, it has engravings as a very distinctive feature, something which is different compared to the other bells. The phrases \"Je vous salue Marie,\" in French, and \"Via viatores quaerit,\" in Latin, which mean \"Hail Mary\" (where the bell gets its name from the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]) and \"The way is looking for travellers\". Below the phrase appears an image of the Baby [[Jesus]] and his parents surrounded by stars and a relief with the [[Adoration of the Magi]]. It is in charge of the Small Solennel, which is similar to the Great Solennel except that the ringing peal starts with the bourdon and the eight bells in the north tower. This ring is heard on only 1 January (New Year's Day) at the stroke of midnight and it replaces Emmanuel for international events. Like Emmanuel, the bells are used to mark specific moments such as the arrival at the Cathedral of the body of the deceased Archbishop of Paris.\n\nIn the North Tower, there are eight bells varying in size from largest to smallest. Gabriel is the largest bell there; it weighs four tons and plays an A sharp. It is named after [[Gabriel|the Archangel Gabriel]], who announced the birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary. Built in a bell foundry outside Paris in 2013, it also chimes the hour through the day. Like Emmanuel and Marie, Gabriel is used to mark specific events. It is used mainly for masses on Sundays in ordinary times and some solemnities falling during the week in the Plenum North. It shows 40 circular lines representing the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert and the 40 years of Moses' crossing the Sinai.\n\nAnne-Genevi\u00e8ve is the second largest bell in the North Tower and the fourth largest bell in the cathedral. Named after two saints: [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]], Mary's mother, and [[Genevieve|St. Genevi\u00e8ve]] the patron saint of Paris, it plays a B and it weighs three tons. It has three circular lines that represent the Holy Trinity and three theological virtues. Like Emmanuel, Marie and Gabriel, Anne-Genevieve is used to mark specific moments such as the opening of the doors to the [[Palm Sunday]] mass or the body of the deceased Archbishop of Paris. Also it is the only bell that does not participate in a chime called the Angelus Domini, which happens in the summer at 8am, noon and 8pm (or 9am, noon and 9pm).\n\nDenis&nbsp;is the third largest bell in the North Tower and fifth largest bell in the cathedral. It is named after [[Denis|St. Denis]], the martyr who was also the first bishop of Paris around the year 250; it weighs 2 tons and plays a C sharp. This bell includes the third phrase of the Angelus, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord\". There are also seven circular lines representing the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the seven Sacraments.\n\nMarcel&nbsp;is the fourth largest bell in the North Tower and sixth largest bell in the cathedral. It&nbsp;is named after the {{ill|Marcel of Paris|lt=9th bishop of Paris|fr|Marcel de Paris}}. It plays a D sharp and weighs 1.9 tons. It is named after Saint Marcel, the ninth bishop of Paris, known for his tireless service to the poor and sick in the fifth century. The bell that bears his name as a tribute has engraved upon it the fourth sentence of the Angelus, \"Be it done unto me according to Thy word\".\n\n\u00c9tienne is the fifth largest bell in the North Tower and seventh largest bell in the cathedral. It is named after St. \u00c9tienne (English [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]]), the first Christian martyr. It plays an E sharp and weighs 1.5 tons with its most prominent feature being its gold stripe slightly above the nameplate.\n\nBeno\u00eet-Joseph is the sixth largest bell in the North Tower and eighth largest bell in the cathedral. The bell is named in honor of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], using the French version of his [[papal name|pontifical name]] combined with his given name (Joseph). It plays an F and weighs 1.3 tons. It has two silver stripes above the skirt and one silver stripe above the nameplate. This bell is used for weddings and sometimes chimes the hour replacing Gabriel, most likely on a chime called the [[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]].\n\nMaurice is the seventh largest bell in the North Tower and second smallest in the cathedral. It is named after [[Maurice de Sully]], the bishop of Paris who laid the first stone for the construction of the Cathedral. It includes the inscription, \"Pray for us, Holy Mother of God\". It plays a G sharp and weighs one ton. It has two gray stripes below the nameplate. This bell is used for weddings.\n\nJean Marie is the smallest bell of the cathedral. Unlike Beno\u00eet-Joseph and Anne-Genevi\u00e8ve which have two names, it is named after Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]], Paris' bishop from 1981 until 2005, and on it is engraved the eighth and last sentence of the Angelus: \"that we might be made worthy of the promises of Christ\". It plays an A sharp and weighs 0.780 tons. It has a small gray stripe above the skirt. This bell is also used for weddings.\n\n==Ownership==\nUntil the French Revolution, Notre-Dame was the property of the Archbishop of Paris and therefore the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It was nationalized on 2 November 1789 and since then has been the property of the French state.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u00c0 qui appartient la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris?|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/aqui-appartient-la-cathedrale-notre-dame-de-paris-1674259.html|date=16 April 2019|work=[[BFM TV]]|language=fr|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref> Under the Concordat of 1801, use of the cathedral was returned to the Church, but not ownership. Legislation from 1833 and 1838 clarified that cathedrals were maintained at the expense of the French government. This was reaffirmed in [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], designating the Catholic Church as having the exclusive right to use it for religious purposes in perpetuity. Notre-Dame is one of seventy historic churches in France with this status. The archdiocese is responsible for paying the employees, for security, heating and cleaning, and for ensuring that the cathedral is open free to visitors. The archdiocese does not receive subsidies from the French state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Loi du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1905 concernant la s\u00e9paration des Eglises et de l'Etat.|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070169&dateTexte=20080306|language=fr|publisher=Government of France|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref>Communique of the Press and Communication Service of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Paris, November 2014.</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:ZuccaParis11.jpg|Notre-Dame de Paris (1944)\nFile:Paris - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame - Tr\u00e9sor de la cath\u00e9drale - Ornements sacerdotaux -3.JPG|19th-century [[vestments]]\nFile:Notre-dame-looking-up-np.jpg|A wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western fa\u00e7ade\nFile:Notre Dame Paris front facade lower.jpg|Notre-Dame's [[fa\u00e7ade]] showing the Portal of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]], Portal of the [[Last Judgment]], and Portal of [[Saint Anne|St-Anne]]\nFile:Notre dame view from Montparnasse Tower.jpg|A 2010 view of Notre-Dame from [[Tour Montparnasse]]\nFile:Notre Dame de Paris.JPG|A wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western fa\u00e7ade\nFile:Notre dame de paris, statua della nostra signora di parigi.JPG |[[Virgin of Paris]], 14th century.

It borders the Brazilian states of [[Amap\u00e1]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] and [[Roraima]]. To the northwest are the borders of [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]], to the northeast of Par\u00e1 is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bel\u00e9m]], which is located at the mouth of the Amazon.\n\nPar\u00e1 is the most populous state of the northern region, with a population of over 8.6 million, being the ninth-most populous state in Brazil. It is the second-largest state of Brazil in area, with 1.2 million km\u00b2 (460,000 square miles), second only to [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] upriver. Its most famous icons are the [[Amazon River]] and the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. Par\u00e1 produces [[Natural rubber|rubber]] (extracted from natural [[rubber tree]] groves), tropical [[hardwood]]s such as [[mahogany]], and minerals such as [[iron ore]] and [[bauxite]]. A new commodity crop is [[soy]], cultivated in the region of Santar\u00e9m.\n\nEvery October, Bel\u00e9m receives tens of thousands of [[tourist]]s for the year's most important religious celebration: the procession of the [[C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9]]. Another important attraction of the capital is the Maraj\u00f3-style ceramics, based on the extinct [[Marajoara culture]], which developed on an island in the Amazon River.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe state's name is a [[toponym]] of the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] word ''par\u00e1'' \u2013 literally \"[[sea]]\", but sometimes used to refer to large rivers.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Maria Vicentina P.

These groups were subsequently named by European settlers as \"Indians\". There are archaeological records proving the human presence in Brazil and the region of [[Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1|Santar\u00e9m]] since 3000 BC.\n\n[[Maraj\u00f3]] people lived in farmer's huts or houses 3,500 years ago. These people knew ceramics, dyes, natural medicinal compounds; practiced slash-and-burn (to clear the land); and planted cassava. Their culture remains in Marajoara pottery, which has peculiar size and decoration. The period from 500 to 1300 was the height of the Marajoara culture.\n\n===Formation of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o===\n{{see also|State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o}}\nThe region of the Amazon valley, by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), was in possession of the Spanish Crown, the Portuguese expeditionaries, with the purpose of consolidating the region as Portuguese territory, founded the Fort of the Nativity ([[Forte do Pres\u00e9pio]]) in 1616, in what was then called [[Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m do Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1]] (Saint Mary of Bethlehem of the Great Par\u00e1). The building was the first of the model on [[Amazon region|Amazon]] and the most significant in the Amazon territory until 1660. Despite the construction of fort, the occupation of territory was marked by early Dutch and English incursions in search of spices, hence the need of the Portuguese to fortify the area.<ref name=\"Bueno1\" />\n\nIn the 17th century, the region, integrated into the [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|captaincy of Maranh\u00e3o]], was prosperous with crops and livestock. In 1616 the captaincy of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 was created, belonging to the Portuguese colonial state of Maranh\u00e3o. In the same year the state of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o transferred capital to [[Belem, Brazil|Belem]], forming and attaching the captaincy of Rio Negro in 1755 by creating the [[State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Rio Negro]].\n\nIn 1751, with the expansion to the west, the colonial state of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, which besides the captaincy of Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 would host the captaincy of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Negro (today the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|State of Amazonas]]).\n\nIn 1823, the Par\u00e1 decided to join the independent Brazil, which had been separated during the colonial period, reporting directly to Lisbon. However, political infighting continued. The most important of them, the [[Cabanagem]] (1835), decreed the independence of the province of Par\u00e1. This was, along with the revolution Farroupilha, [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the only to lift the regency period when the power was taken. Cabanagem was the only revolt led by the popular strata.\n\n===Cabanagem===\n{{see also|Cabanagem}}\n[[File:Cabanagem Bel\u00e9m 1835.jpg|250px|thumb|right|19th century engraving about the Cabanagem]]\nCabanagem, a popular and social revolt during the [[Empire of Brazil]], in the [[Amazon region]], was influenced by the French Revolution. It was mainly due to extreme poverty, hunger and disease that devastated the Amazon at the beginning of the period, in the former province of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, which included the current [[Amaz\u00f4nia Legal|Amazonian states]] of Par\u00e1, [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Amap\u00e1]], [[Roraima]] and [[Rond\u00f4nia]]. The revolt spread from 1835 until January 1840, due to the process of independence of Brazil (1822), which did not occur immediately in the province due to political irrelevance to which the region was relegated by Prince Regent [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]. After independence, the strong Portuguese influence remained stable, giving political irrelevance in this province to the Brazilian central government.\n\nIndians, blacks, and mestizos (mostly poor class members), all named cabanos (cabins), teamed against the Regent Government and rebelled, to increase the importance of the region in Brazil's central government addressing the issue of poverty as one of the reasons. All lived in mud huts (hence the name of the revolt).<ref name=\"NYT4\">{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/?action=click&contentCollection=Americas&region=TopBar&WT.nav=searchWidget&module=SearchSubmit&pgtype=article#/Bel%C3%A9m%2C+Brazil/since1851/allresults/1/allauthors/oldest/ | title=THE BRAZILS.; The Don Pedro II. Railway Portion Built by American Contractors An Imperial Visit Miscellaneous News. | publisher=New York Times | date=July 16, 1860 | accessdate=March 9, 2017 | author=From Our Own Correspondent - Print Headline}}</ref> At the bottom of the rebellion, there was a mobilization of the Brazilian Empire against the reactionary forces of the province of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 in expelling the insurgents who wanted to keep the region as a Portuguese colony or territory independent. Many of the local leaders, who resented the lack of political participation in decisions of the centralizer of the Brazil government, contributed to the climate of dissatisfaction against the provincial government.\n\n===Rubber cycle and mineral extraction===\nAfter the revolt, the local economy grew rapidly during the 19th century and early 20th century by exploitation of rubber, the latex, by extracting it. At this period the Amazon experienced two distinct economic cycles with the exploitation of the same raw material.\n\nThe intendant Ant\u00f4nio Lemos was the main character of the urban transformation that Bel\u00e9m experienced, which came to be known as Paris n\u2019America (Paris in the America), as a reference to the influence of the urbanization that Paris had experienced at the time, which served as the inspiration for Ant\u00f4nio Lemos.\n\nDuring this period, for example, the city center was heavily lined with mango trees transported from India and development inspired by the model of Paris. With the decline of the two cycles of rubber (1870\u20131920 and 1940\u20131945),<ref name=\"NYT3\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/americas/deep-in-brazils-amazon-exploring-the-ruins-of-fords-fantasyland.html | title=Deep in Brazil\u2019s Amazon, Exploring the Ruins of Ford\u2019s Fantasyland | publisher=The New York Times | date=February 20, 2017 | accessdate=March 9, 2017 | author=By SIMON ROMERO}}</ref> came a distressing economic stagnation, which stopped in the 1960s and 1970s,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/magazine/an-epic-struggle-for-gold.html | title=An Epic Struggle for Gold | publisher=New York Times | date=June 7, 1987 | accessdate=March 9, 2017 | author=By SIMONS, Marlise}}</ref> with the development of agricultural activities in the south of the state.

There have been conflicts between government, indigenous tribes, the Caboclos who are mixed-race peasants of the area, and ranchers over land rights. The situation is unlikely to be resolved soon, particularly due to the demand for beef from Europe and soya from China.\n\nThe controversial [[Belo Monte Dam]] is a proposed hydroelectric dam complex to be built on the [[Xingu River]]; opponents believe that it threatens the habitat of a relatively undisturbed area of Par\u00e1's rainforest, and would endanger several endemic fish species.

They have told their stories in a permanent space, the \"Room Vicente Salles\" of the \"Memorial of the People\", in [[Bel\u00e9m]]. The Portuguese colonists were followed by Spaniards fleeing wars and social unrest due to political disputes in the Iberian Peninsula. The Japanese have become established in agrarian communities, settling in towns such as [[Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u]].\n\n[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers and missionaries settled in the state in the 17th century. In January 1616, the Portuguese captain, [[Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco]] began the occupation of the land, founding the Fort of the Nativity, nucleus of the future state capital. Portuguese religious missions were used to establish settlements between here and the Fort St. Louis of Maranh\u00e3o. Most settlers sailed up the Amazon River as travel overland was extremely arduous. The Portuguese were the first to arrive in Par\u00e1, leaving contributions ranging from cuisine to architecture.\n\nThe first [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants who settled in the Amazon left the [[Port of Kobe]] in Japan, on July 24, 1926, and reached the city of [[Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u]], on 22 September of that year, with stops in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Bel\u00e9m]].\n\nThe Japanese introduced crops such as jute and black pepper in the 1930s; jute was so successful that it drove a boom in the regional economy. In the 1970s, Japanese farmers introduced cultivation of Hawaiian papaya and melon, for which there is international demand. The third largest ethnic Japanese community in Brazil is in Par\u00e1, with about 13,000 inhabitants (surpassed only by settlements in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1). They live mainly in the cities of Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u, Santa Izabel do Par\u00e1, and [[Castanhal]].\n\nItalian immigrants in Par\u00e1 came predominantly from the south of Italy, originating in [[Calabria]], Campania and Basilicata. It was a time of a wave of emigration. They were all settlers and devoted to trade. The first Italian trade was recorded in 1888 in Santar\u00e9m. The immigrants planted family roots in Bel\u00e9m, [[Breves, Par\u00e1|Breves]], [[Abaetetuba]], [[\u00d3bidos, Brazil|\u00d3bidos]], [[Oriximin\u00e1]], Santar\u00e9m and Alenquer. The presence in western Par\u00e1 was so pronounced that the Consulate of Italy established an office in \u00d3bidos, which is the largest city populated by Italians in the state. The consulate was in Recife, Pernambuco.\n\nIn Bel\u00e9m, the Italians worked in commercial and retail services. They were important during the beginning of the industrialization of the state capital (1895). According to the 1920 census, about 1,000 Italians lived in Par\u00e1. At the end of [[World War II]], another wave of Italian immigrants arrived after the persecution of Japanese, Italians, and Germans. Similar to French immigrants, this wave of Italians did not remain in Par\u00e1.\n\n[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] immigrants arrived in Par\u00e1 in the mid-19th century, at the time of the rubber boom, and through 1914. There were between 15,000 and 25,000 Syrian-Lebanese immigrants, of whom one-third went to Acre. In Par\u00e1, the Lebanese settled in Belem, and in the cities of Camet\u00e1, [[Marab\u00e1]], Altamira, Breves, Monte Alegre, Alenquer, Santar\u00e9m, \u00d3bidos, Soure, Maracan\u00e3, Abaetetuba, among others.\n\nThe first French immigrants arrived in Brazil in the second half of the 19th century, settling in the colony of Benevides, the metropolitan region of [[Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1]]. The French were attracted to the region because of the rubber boom, eventually settling in Bel\u00e9m, which became known as ''Paris N'Am\u00e9rica''.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Par\u00e1}}\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[service sector]] is the largest component of [[GDP]] at 40.9%, followed by the [[industrial sector]] at 36.3%.

These people knew ceramics, dyes, natural medicinal compounds; practiced slash-and-burn (to clear the land); and planted cassava. Their culture remains in Marajoara pottery, which has peculiar size and decoration. The period from 500 to 1300 was the height of the Marajoara culture.\n\n===Formation of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o===\n{{see also|State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o}}\nThe region of the Amazon valley, by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), was in possession of the Spanish Crown, the Portuguese expeditionaries, with the purpose of consolidating the region as Portuguese territory, founded the Fort of the Nativity ([[Forte do Pres\u00e9pio]]) in 1616, in what was then called [[Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m do Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1]] (Saint Mary of Bethlehem of the Great Par\u00e1). The building was the first of the model on [[Amazon region|Amazon]] and the most significant in the Amazon territory until 1660. Despite the construction of fort, the occupation of territory was marked by early Dutch and English incursions in search of spices, hence the need of the Portuguese to fortify the area.<ref name=\"Bueno1\" />\n\nIn the 17th century, the region, integrated into the [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|captaincy of Maranh\u00e3o]], was prosperous with crops and livestock. In 1616 the captaincy of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 was created, belonging to the Portuguese colonial state of Maranh\u00e3o. In the same year the state of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o transferred capital to [[Belem, Brazil|Belem]], forming and attaching the captaincy of Rio Negro in 1755 by creating the [[State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Rio Negro]].\n\nIn 1751, with the expansion to the west, the colonial state of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, which besides the captaincy of Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 would host the captaincy of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Negro (today the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|State of Amazonas]]).\n\nIn 1823, the Par\u00e1 decided to join the independent Brazil, which had been separated during the colonial period, reporting directly to Lisbon. However, political infighting continued. The most important of them, the [[Cabanagem]] (1835), decreed the independence of the province of Par\u00e1. This was, along with the revolution Farroupilha, [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the only to lift the regency period when the power was taken. Cabanagem was the only revolt led by the popular strata.\n\n===Cabanagem===\n{{see also|Cabanagem}}\n[[File:Cabanagem Bel\u00e9m 1835.jpg|250px|thumb|right|19th century engraving about the Cabanagem]]\nCabanagem, a popular and social revolt during the [[Empire of Brazil]], in the [[Amazon region]], was influenced by the French Revolution. It was mainly due to extreme poverty, hunger and disease that devastated the Amazon at the beginning of the period, in the former province of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, which included the current [[Amaz\u00f4nia Legal|Amazonian states]] of Par\u00e1, [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Amap\u00e1]], [[Roraima]] and [[Rond\u00f4nia]]. The revolt spread from 1835 until January 1840, due to the process of independence of Brazil (1822), which did not occur immediately in the province due to political irrelevance to which the region was relegated by Prince Regent [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]. After independence, the strong Portuguese influence remained stable, giving political irrelevance in this province to the Brazilian central government.\n\nIndians, blacks, and mestizos (mostly poor class members), all named cabanos (cabins), teamed against the Regent Government and rebelled, to increase the importance of the region in Brazil's central government addressing the issue of poverty as one of the reasons. All lived in mud huts (hence the name of the revolt).<ref name=\"NYT4\">{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/?action=click&contentCollection=Americas&region=TopBar&WT.nav=searchWidget&module=SearchSubmit&pgtype=article#/Bel%C3%A9m%2C+Brazil/since1851/allresults/1/allauthors/oldest/ | title=THE BRAZILS.; The Don Pedro II.

Many of the local leaders, who resented the lack of political participation in decisions of the centralizer of the Brazil government, contributed to the climate of dissatisfaction against the provincial government.\n\n===Rubber cycle and mineral extraction===\nAfter the revolt, the local economy grew rapidly during the 19th century and early 20th century by exploitation of rubber, the latex, by extracting it. At this period the Amazon experienced two distinct economic cycles with the exploitation of the same raw material.\n\nThe intendant Ant\u00f4nio Lemos was the main character of the urban transformation that Bel\u00e9m experienced, which came to be known as Paris n\u2019America (Paris in the America), as a reference to the influence of the urbanization that Paris had experienced at the time, which served as the inspiration for Ant\u00f4nio Lemos.\n\nDuring this period, for example, the city center was heavily lined with mango trees transported from India and development inspired by the model of Paris.

They have told their stories in a permanent space, the \"Room Vicente Salles\" of the \"Memorial of the People\", in [[Bel\u00e9m]]. The Portuguese colonists were followed by Spaniards fleeing wars and social unrest due to political disputes in the Iberian Peninsula. The Japanese have become established in agrarian communities, settling in towns such as [[Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u]].\n\n[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers and missionaries settled in the state in the 17th century. In January 1616, the Portuguese captain, [[Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco]] began the occupation of the land, founding the Fort of the Nativity, nucleus of the future state capital. Portuguese religious missions were used to establish settlements between here and the Fort St. Louis of Maranh\u00e3o. Most settlers sailed up the Amazon River as travel overland was extremely arduous. The Portuguese were the first to arrive in Par\u00e1, leaving contributions ranging from cuisine to architecture.\n\nThe first [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants who settled in the Amazon left the [[Port of Kobe]] in Japan, on July 24, 1926, and reached the city of [[Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u]], on 22 September of that year, with stops in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Bel\u00e9m]].\n\nThe Japanese introduced crops such as jute and black pepper in the 1930s; jute was so successful that it drove a boom in the regional economy. In the 1970s, Japanese farmers introduced cultivation of Hawaiian papaya and melon, for which there is international demand. The third largest ethnic Japanese community in Brazil is in Par\u00e1, with about 13,000 inhabitants (surpassed only by settlements in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1). They live mainly in the cities of Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u, Santa Izabel do Par\u00e1, and [[Castanhal]].\n\nItalian immigrants in Par\u00e1 came predominantly from the south of Italy, originating in [[Calabria]], Campania and Basilicata. It was a time of a wave of emigration. They were all settlers and devoted to trade. The first Italian trade was recorded in 1888 in Santar\u00e9m. The immigrants planted family roots in Bel\u00e9m, [[Breves, Par\u00e1|Breves]], [[Abaetetuba]], [[\u00d3bidos, Brazil|\u00d3bidos]], [[Oriximin\u00e1]], Santar\u00e9m and Alenquer. The presence in western Par\u00e1 was so pronounced that the Consulate of Italy established an office in \u00d3bidos, which is the largest city populated by Italians in the state. The consulate was in Recife, Pernambuco.\n\nIn Bel\u00e9m, the Italians worked in commercial and retail services. They were important during the beginning of the industrialization of the state capital (1895). According to the 1920 census, about 1,000 Italians lived in Par\u00e1. At the end of [[World War II]], another wave of Italian immigrants arrived after the persecution of Japanese, Italians, and Germans. Similar to French immigrants, this wave of Italians did not remain in Par\u00e1.\n\n[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] immigrants arrived in Par\u00e1 in the mid-19th century, at the time of the rubber boom, and through 1914. There were between 15,000 and 25,000 Syrian-Lebanese immigrants, of whom one-third went to Acre. In Par\u00e1, the Lebanese settled in Belem, and in the cities of Camet\u00e1, [[Marab\u00e1]], Altamira, Breves, Monte Alegre, Alenquer, Santar\u00e9m, \u00d3bidos, Soure, Maracan\u00e3, Abaetetuba, among others.\n\nThe first French immigrants arrived in Brazil in the second half of the 19th century, settling in the colony of Benevides, the metropolitan region of [[Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1]]. The French were attracted to the region because of the rubber boom, eventually settling in Bel\u00e9m, which became known as ''Paris N'Am\u00e9rica''.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Par\u00e1}}\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[service sector]] is the largest component of [[GDP]] at 40.9%, followed by the [[industrial sector]] at 36.3%.

Acrylic paints are [[water-soluble]], but become [[water-resistant]] when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]], a [[gouache]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.<ref name=\"Art Materials\">{{cite web|url=http://www.daler-rowney.com/ |title=Art Materials |publisher=Daler Rowney |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Otto R\u00f6hm]] invented [[acrylic resin]], which was quickly transformed into acrylic paint. As early as 1934, the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company [[BASF]], which was patented by [[Rohm and Haas]]. The synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, combining some of the properties of oil and watercolor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phaidon Press |title=The 20th-Century art book |year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0714835420 |edition=Reprinted.}}</ref>  Between 1946 and 1949, [[Leonard Bocour]] and [[Sam Golden]] invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand [[Magna paint]]. These were [[mineral spirits|mineral spirit]]-based paints.<ref>Terry Fenton  [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials online essay] about [[Kenneth Noland]], and acrylic paint, accessed April 30, 2007</ref> Acrylics were made commercially available in the 1950s.\n\nFollowing that development, Golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called \"Aquatec\".<ref>{{cite web|title = A History of GOLDEN Artist Colors, Inc.|publisher = Golden Artist Colors, Inc.|url = http://www.goldenpaints.com/history}}</ref> In 1953, Jose L. Gutierrez produced ''Politec Acrylic Artists' Colors'' in Mexico, and Henry Levinson of Cincinnati-based Permanent Pigments Co. produced [[Liquitex]] colors. These two product lines were the very first acrylic emulsion artists' paints.<ref>Painting With Acrylics (Watson-Guptill publications)</ref>\n\nWater-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as [[latex]] house paints, as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of [[Binder (material)|binder]] (sometimes acrylic, [[Vinyl group|vinyl]], [[Polyvinyl acetate|pva]], and others), [[filler (materials)|filler]], [[pigment]], and [[water]]. Exterior latex house paints may also be a [[co-polymer]] blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors.  Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVA) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |title=Water-based Alchemy by Dean Sickler |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829153753/http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders. Water-soluble artists' acrylic paints were sold commercially by [[Liquitex]] beginning in the 1950s, with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early '60s. In 1963, [[George Rowney|Rowney]] (part of [[Daler-Rowney]] since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artist's acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name \"Cryla\".<ref name=\"Art Materials\" />\n\n== Painting with acrylics ==\nBefore the 19th century, artists mixed their own paints,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hermens |first1=Erma |title=The colour of imagination |url=https://www.bbc.com/timelines/zqytpv4 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> which allowed them to achieve the desired color and thickness, and to control the use of fillers, if any. While suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, hand mixing may not be practical because of the fast drying time and other technical issues, such as the necessity to combine several polymers, as well as surfactants, plasticizers, dispersants, defoamers and stabilisers in the correct amounts and order.\n\nAcrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic mediums<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Modify Acrylic Paint with Mediums |url=https://www.mybluprint.com/article/modifying-acrylic-paint-with-mediums-everything-you-need-to-know |website=My Blue Print |publisher=My Blue Print}}</ref> or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums, but the range of acrylic mediums is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and mediums can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods such as [[medium-density fibreboard|medium-density fiberboard]] can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces.<ref>Sealing, Staining, and Filling [http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HI_27.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803080346/https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HI_27.pdf |date=2010-08-03 }} Wood Finishing and Refinishing accessed December 08, 2010</ref> In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based mediums. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint\u2014gel and molding paste are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Medaris Culea |first1=Patti |title=Creative Cloth Doll Faces: Using Paints, Pastels, Fibers, Beading, Collage |date=2005 |publisher=Quarry Books |isbn=159253144X |page=64}}</ref> or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.\n\nAcrylic paints are the most common paints used in [[surrealist techniques#Grattage|grattage]], a surrealist technique that became popular with the advent of acrylic paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.<ref>Grattage [http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Grattage] Art Techniques accessed December 08, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Painting techniques ===\n\n{{Main|Acrylic painting techniques }}\n\nAcrylic artists' paints may be thinned with water or acrylic medium and used as [[Wash (visual arts)|washes]] in the manner of watercolor paints, but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of [[gum arabic]]-based watercolor paints. Instead, the paint is applied in layers, sometimes diluting with water or acrylic medium to allow layers underneath to partially show through. Using an acrylic medium gives the paint more of a rich and glossy appearance, whereas using water makes the paint look more like watercolor and have a matte finish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/acrylic/how-to-thin-acrylic-paint-painting-with-acrylics-for-beginners/|title=2 Ways to Thin Acrylic Paint {{!}} Painting with Acrylics for Beginners|last=Staff|first=Artists Network|date=2016-10-11|website=Artists Network|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|Fluorescent acrylic paints lit by UV light. Paintings by Beo Beyond.|alt=A person in silhouette stands gazing down at a piece of art on the floor. Paintings on the wall behind the person are glowing from the UV light.]]\n\nAcrylic paints with [[Gloss (paint)|gloss or matte]] finishes are common, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit a range of finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden]], [[Liquitex]], [[Winsor & Newton]] and [[Daler-Rowney]]); Politec acrylics are fully matte.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valgreen.com/acrilyic-painting/|title=Val Green's Art Space  \u2013 Acrylic Painting|website=www.valgreen.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen.\n\nWhen dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although [[isopropyl alcohol]] can lift some fresh paint films off. [[Toluene]] and [[acetone]] can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers (acrylic [[gesso]], et cetera). Oils and warm, soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin. Acrylic paint can be removed from non-porus plastic surfaces, such as miniatures or models using certain cleaning products such as Dettol (containing chloroxylenol 4.8% v/w)<ref>Removing Acrylic Paint From Skin [http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf419156.tip.html] Instructions accessed December 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAn acrylic sizing should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints, to prevent Support Induced Discoloration (SID). Acrylic paint contains surfactants that can pull up discoloration from a raw canvas, especially in transparent glazed or translucent gelled areas.  Gesso alone will not stop SID; a sizing must be applied before using a gesso.<ref>Preparing A Painting Support [https://www.goldenpaints.com/technicalinfo_prepsupp] accessed December 17, 2017</ref><ref>OPEN Acrylics, Shellac, and SID [http://www.justpaint.org/open-acrylics-shellac-and-sid/] accessed December 17, 2017</ref>\n\nThe viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are [[Acrylic retarder|retarders]] to slow drying and extend ''workability'' time, and ''flow releases'' to increase color-blending ability.\n\n== Properties==\n\n===Grades===\n\nCommercial acrylic paints come in two grades:\n* '''Artist acrylics''' ('''professional acrylics''') are created and designed to resist chemical reactions from exposure to water, ultraviolet light, and oxygen.<ref name=\"Patti Brady\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Patti|title=rethinking acrylic|date=December 29, 2008|publisher=North Light Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=1600610137|page=16}}</ref> Professional-grade acrylics have the most pigment, which allows for more medium manipulation and limits the color shift when mixed with other colors or after drying.<ref name=\"Will Kemp\">{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Will|title=The 8 key differences between Artist quality vs Student grade acrylic paints|url=http://willkempartschool.com/what-is-the-difference-between-artist-quality-vs-student-grade-acrylic-paints/|website=willkempartschool.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"AGColors\">{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=David Lloyd|title=Color Mixing in Acrylic|date=2014|publisher=Walter Foster Publishing|isbn=9781600583889|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwX2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=acrylic+paint+grades&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBWoVChMIh6uB7b-VyQIVg7geCh3KJwhV#v=onepage&q=acrylic%20paint%20grades&f=false|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Student acrylics''' have working characteristics similar to artist acrylics, but with lower pigment concentrations, less-expensive formulas, and fewer available colors. More expensive pigments are generally replicated by hues. Colors are designed to be mixed even though color strength is lower. Hues may not have exactly the same mixing characteristics as full-strength colors.<ref name=\"Will Kemp\"/><ref name=\"AGColors\" />\n\n=== Varieties ===\n*'''Heavy body acrylics''' are typically found in the Artist and Student Grade paints. \"Heavy Body\" refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are the best choice for impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium stiff peak. Gel Mediums (\"pigment-less paints\") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.<ref name=\"Liquitex\">{{cite web|title=Heavy Body Acrylic Paint|url=http://www.liquitex.com/PB2ColMenu.aspx?pageid=297&id=290|website=liquitex.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n**Examples of Heavy Body Acrylics are Matisse Structure Acrylic Colors, Lukas Pastos Acrylics, [[Liquitex|Liquitex Heavy Body Acrylics]] and [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden Heavy Body Acrylics]].  \n*'''Medium viscosity acrylics''' \u2013 Fluid acrylics, Soft body acrylics, or High Flow acrylics \u2013 have a lower viscosity but generally the same pigmentation as the Heavy Body acrylics. Available in either Artist quality or Craft quality, the cost and quality vary accordingly. These paints are good for watercolor techniques, airbrush application, or when smooth coverage is desired. Fluid acrylics can be mixed with any medium to thicken them for impasto work, or to thin them for glazing applications.<ref name=\"Golden\">{{cite web|title=Fluid|url=http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/fluid|website=goldenpaints.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n**Examples of fluid acrylics include Lukascryl Liquid, Lukascryl Studio, [[Liquitex|Liquitex Soft Body]] and [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden Fluid acrylics]]. \n*'''Open acrylics''' were created to address the one major difference between oil and acrylic paints: the shortened time it takes acrylic paints to dry. Designed by Golden Artist Colors, Inc. with a hydrophilic acrylic resin, these paints can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, or even weeks, to dry completely, depending on paint thickness, support characteristics, temperature, and humidity.<ref name=\"Patti\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Patti|title=rethinking acrylic|date=2008|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=1600610137|page=14}}</ref> \n*'''Iridescent, pearl''' and '''interference acrylic colors''' combine conventional pigments with powdered mica ([[aluminium silicate]]) or powdered bronze to achieve complex visual effects. Colors have shimmering or reflective characteristics, depending on the coarseness or fineness of the powder. Iridescent colors are used in fine arts and crafts. \n*'''Acrylic gouache''' is like traditional [[gouache]] because it dries to a matte, opaque finish. However, unlike traditional gouache, the acrylic binder makes it water-resistant once it dries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walsh |first1=Sarah |title=Playful Painting: People: Whimsical projects and clever techniques |date=August 2018 |publisher=Walter Foster Publishing |isbn=1633224694}}</ref> Like craft paint, it will adhere to a variety of surfaces, not only canvas and paper. This paint is typically used by water-colorists, cartoonists, or illustrators, and for decorative or [[folk art]] applications.\n**Examples of acrylic gouache are Lascaux Gouache and Turner Acryl Gouache. \n*'''Craft acrylics''' can be used on surfaces besides canvas, such as wood, metal, fabrics, and ceramics. They are used in decorative painting techniques and [[Faux painting|faux finishes]] to decorate objects of ordinary life. Although colors can be mixed, pigments are often not specified. Each color line is formulated instead to achieve a wide range of premixed colors. Craft paints usually employ vinyl or PVA resins to increase adhesion and lower cost.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glover |first1=David Lloyd |title=Color Mixing in Acrylic: Learn to Mix Fresh, Vibrant Colors for Still Lifes |date=August 2014 |publisher=Walter Foster Publishing |isbn=1600583881 |page=10}}</ref> \n*'''Interactive acrylics''' are all-purpose acrylic artists' colors which have the characteristic fast-drying nature of artists' acrylics, but are formulated to allow artists to delay drying when they need more working time, or re-wet their work when they want to do more wet blending.\n*'''Exterior acrylics''' are paints that can withstand outdoor conditions. Like craft acrylics, they adhere to many surfaces. They are more resistant to both water and ultraviolet light. This makes them the acrylic of choice for architectural murals, outdoor signs, and many [[Faux finish|faux-finishing techniques]].\n\n=== Differences between acrylic and oil paint ===\n[[File:Small Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of acrylic painting showing finishes that resemble both oil and watercolor|alt=Opaque red/orange square in the upper-right corner looks opaque like oil paint. The textured grey/black area looks like watercolor.]]\nThe vehicle and binder of [[oil paint]]s is [[linseed oil]] (or another [[drying oil]]), whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an [[emulsion]] (suspension) of acrylic polymer, which serves as the binder. Thus, oil paint is said to be \"oil-based\", whereas acrylic paint is \"water-based\" (or sometimes \"water-borne\").\n[[File:Acryl Stilleven met blauwe kan Julien Grandgagnage.jpg|left|thumb|Example of blending technique with acrylics. Painting on wooden panel.]]\n[[File:Acrylic Blending.jpg|thumb|A demonstration of blending with acrylic paint. No retarders were used.|alt=An acrylic painting of a red and blue face in profile lies on top of a tray on a table. Below the painting, on the table, are a palette and various sizes and colors of paint.]]\n\nThe main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over [[underpainting]]s. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of [[acrylic retarder]]s. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.\n\nOil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or [[turpentine]] to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists' use. Oil paint films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of \"[[fat over lean]]\" must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable.\n\nOil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint. As linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment. Oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions, which imparts a unique \"look and feel\" to the resultant paint film. Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics and vice versa, as each medium has different chemical sensitivities. Some historical pigments are alkali sensitive, and therefore cannot be made in an acrylic emulsion; others are just too difficult to formulate.<ref>[http://www.justpaint.org/some-historical-pigments-and-their-replacements/ Some Historical Pigments and Their Replacements] accessed December 18, 2017</ref> Approximate \"hue\" color formulations, that do not contain the historical pigments, are typically offered as substitutes.<ref>[http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/fluid/prussian-blue-hue Prussian Blue Hue (Fluid)] accessed December 18, 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/heavy-body/viridian-green-hue Viridian Green Hue (Heavy Body)] accessed December 18, 2017</ref>\n\nDue to acrylic paint's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15\u201320 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of [[wet-in-wet]] technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.\n\nMeanwhile, acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion \u2013 as this binder dries, the paint remains flexible.<ref>Acrylic Paint Common Questions [http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm] Technical Summary of Acrylic Paint accessed December 06, 2010 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101090912/http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm|date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAnother difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints. Acrylics are very useful in mixed media, allowing the use of pastel (oil and chalk), charcoal and pen (among others) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible\u2014sand, rice, and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics.

Acrylic paints are [[water-soluble]], but become [[water-resistant]] when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]], a [[gouache]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.<ref name=\"Art Materials\">{{cite web|url=http://www.daler-rowney.com/ |title=Art Materials |publisher=Daler Rowney |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Otto R\u00f6hm]] invented [[acrylic resin]], which was quickly transformed into acrylic paint. As early as 1934, the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company [[BASF]], which was patented by [[Rohm and Haas]]. The synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, combining some of the properties of oil and watercolor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phaidon Press |title=The 20th-Century art book |year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0714835420 |edition=Reprinted.}}</ref>  Between 1946 and 1949, [[Leonard Bocour]] and [[Sam Golden]] invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand [[Magna paint]]. These were [[mineral spirits|mineral spirit]]-based paints.<ref>Terry Fenton  [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials online essay] about [[Kenneth Noland]], and acrylic paint, accessed April 30, 2007</ref> Acrylics were made commercially available in the 1950s.\n\nFollowing that development, Golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called \"Aquatec\".<ref>{{cite web|title = A History of GOLDEN Artist Colors, Inc.|publisher = Golden Artist Colors, Inc.|url = http://www.goldenpaints.com/history}}</ref> In 1953, Jose L. Gutierrez produced ''Politec Acrylic Artists' Colors'' in Mexico, and Henry Levinson of Cincinnati-based Permanent Pigments Co. produced [[Liquitex]] colors. These two product lines were the very first acrylic emulsion artists' paints.<ref>Painting With Acrylics (Watson-Guptill publications)</ref>\n\nWater-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as [[latex]] house paints, as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of [[Binder (material)|binder]] (sometimes acrylic, [[Vinyl group|vinyl]], [[Polyvinyl acetate|pva]], and others), [[filler (materials)|filler]], [[pigment]], and [[water]]. Exterior latex house paints may also be a [[co-polymer]] blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors.  Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVA) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |title=Water-based Alchemy by Dean Sickler |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829153753/http://dundean.com/tips_what_is_latex_paint.shtml |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders. Water-soluble artists' acrylic paints were sold commercially by [[Liquitex]] beginning in the 1950s, with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early '60s. In 1963, [[George Rowney|Rowney]] (part of [[Daler-Rowney]] since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artist's acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name \"Cryla\".<ref name=\"Art Materials\" />\n\n== Painting with acrylics ==\nBefore the 19th century, artists mixed their own paints,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hermens |first1=Erma |title=The colour of imagination |url=https://www.bbc.com/timelines/zqytpv4 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> which allowed them to achieve the desired color and thickness, and to control the use of fillers, if any. While suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, hand mixing may not be practical because of the fast drying time and other technical issues, such as the necessity to combine several polymers, as well as surfactants, plasticizers, dispersants, defoamers and stabilisers in the correct amounts and order.\n\nAcrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic mediums<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Modify Acrylic Paint with Mediums |url=https://www.mybluprint.com/article/modifying-acrylic-paint-with-mediums-everything-you-need-to-know |website=My Blue Print |publisher=My Blue Print}}</ref> or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums, but the range of acrylic mediums is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and mediums can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods such as [[medium-density fibreboard|medium-density fiberboard]] can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces.<ref>Sealing, Staining, and Filling [http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HI_27.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803080346/https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HI_27.pdf |date=2010-08-03 }} Wood Finishing and Refinishing accessed December 08, 2010</ref> In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based mediums. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint\u2014gel and molding paste are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Medaris Culea |first1=Patti |title=Creative Cloth Doll Faces: Using Paints, Pastels, Fibers, Beading, Collage |date=2005 |publisher=Quarry Books |isbn=159253144X |page=64}}</ref> or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.\n\nAcrylic paints are the most common paints used in [[surrealist techniques#Grattage|grattage]], a surrealist technique that became popular with the advent of acrylic paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.<ref>Grattage [http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Grattage] Art Techniques accessed December 08, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Painting techniques ===\n\n{{Main|Acrylic painting techniques }}\n\nAcrylic artists' paints may be thinned with water or acrylic medium and used as [[Wash (visual arts)|washes]] in the manner of watercolor paints, but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of [[gum arabic]]-based watercolor paints. Instead, the paint is applied in layers, sometimes diluting with water or acrylic medium to allow layers underneath to partially show through. Using an acrylic medium gives the paint more of a rich and glossy appearance, whereas using water makes the paint look more like watercolor and have a matte finish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/acrylic/how-to-thin-acrylic-paint-painting-with-acrylics-for-beginners/|title=2 Ways to Thin Acrylic Paint {{!}} Painting with Acrylics for Beginners|last=Staff|first=Artists Network|date=2016-10-11|website=Artists Network|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|Fluorescent acrylic paints lit by UV light. Paintings by Beo Beyond.|alt=A person in silhouette stands gazing down at a piece of art on the floor. Paintings on the wall behind the person are glowing from the UV light.]]\n\nAcrylic paints with [[Gloss (paint)|gloss or matte]] finishes are common, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit a range of finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden]], [[Liquitex]], [[Winsor & Newton]] and [[Daler-Rowney]]); Politec acrylics are fully matte.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valgreen.com/acrilyic-painting/|title=Val Green's Art Space  \u2013 Acrylic Painting|website=www.valgreen.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen.\n\nWhen dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although [[isopropyl alcohol]] can lift some fresh paint films off. [[Toluene]] and [[acetone]] can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers (acrylic [[gesso]], et cetera). Oils and warm, soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin. Acrylic paint can be removed from non-porus plastic surfaces, such as miniatures or models using certain cleaning products such as Dettol (containing chloroxylenol 4.8% v/w)<ref>Removing Acrylic Paint From Skin [http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf419156.tip.html] Instructions accessed December 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAn acrylic sizing should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints, to prevent Support Induced Discoloration (SID). Acrylic paint contains surfactants that can pull up discoloration from a raw canvas, especially in transparent glazed or translucent gelled areas.  Gesso alone will not stop SID; a sizing must be applied before using a gesso.<ref>Preparing A Painting Support [https://www.goldenpaints.com/technicalinfo_prepsupp] accessed December 17, 2017</ref><ref>OPEN Acrylics, Shellac, and SID [http://www.justpaint.org/open-acrylics-shellac-and-sid/] accessed December 17, 2017</ref>\n\nThe viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are [[Acrylic retarder|retarders]] to slow drying and extend ''workability'' time, and ''flow releases'' to increase color-blending ability.\n\n== Properties==\n\n===Grades===\n\nCommercial acrylic paints come in two grades:\n* '''Artist acrylics''' ('''professional acrylics''') are created and designed to resist chemical reactions from exposure to water, ultraviolet light, and oxygen.<ref name=\"Patti Brady\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Patti|title=rethinking acrylic|date=December 29, 2008|publisher=North Light Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=1600610137|page=16}}</ref> Professional-grade acrylics have the most pigment, which allows for more medium manipulation and limits the color shift when mixed with other colors or after drying.<ref name=\"Will Kemp\">{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Will|title=The 8 key differences between Artist quality vs Student grade acrylic paints|url=http://willkempartschool.com/what-is-the-difference-between-artist-quality-vs-student-grade-acrylic-paints/|website=willkempartschool.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"AGColors\">{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=David Lloyd|title=Color Mixing in Acrylic|date=2014|publisher=Walter Foster Publishing|isbn=9781600583889|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwX2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=acrylic+paint+grades&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBWoVChMIh6uB7b-VyQIVg7geCh3KJwhV#v=onepage&q=acrylic%20paint%20grades&f=false|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Student acrylics''' have working characteristics similar to artist acrylics, but with lower pigment concentrations, less-expensive formulas, and fewer available colors. More expensive pigments are generally replicated by hues. Colors are designed to be mixed even though color strength is lower. Hues may not have exactly the same mixing characteristics as full-strength colors.<ref name=\"Will Kemp\"/><ref name=\"AGColors\" />\n\n=== Varieties ===\n*'''Heavy body acrylics''' are typically found in the Artist and Student Grade paints. \"Heavy Body\" refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are the best choice for impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium stiff peak. Gel Mediums (\"pigment-less paints\") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.<ref name=\"Liquitex\">{{cite web|title=Heavy Body Acrylic Paint|url=http://www.liquitex.com/PB2ColMenu.aspx?pageid=297&id=290|website=liquitex.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n**Examples of Heavy Body Acrylics are Matisse Structure Acrylic Colors, Lukas Pastos Acrylics, [[Liquitex|Liquitex Heavy Body Acrylics]] and [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden Heavy Body Acrylics]].  \n*'''Medium viscosity acrylics''' \u2013 Fluid acrylics, Soft body acrylics, or High Flow acrylics \u2013 have a lower viscosity but generally the same pigmentation as the Heavy Body acrylics. Available in either Artist quality or Craft quality, the cost and quality vary accordingly. These paints are good for watercolor techniques, airbrush application, or when smooth coverage is desired. Fluid acrylics can be mixed with any medium to thicken them for impasto work, or to thin them for glazing applications.<ref name=\"Golden\">{{cite web|title=Fluid|url=http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/fluid|website=goldenpaints.com/|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n**Examples of fluid acrylics include Lukascryl Liquid, Lukascryl Studio, [[Liquitex|Liquitex Soft Body]] and [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden Fluid acrylics]]. \n*'''Open acrylics''' were created to address the one major difference between oil and acrylic paints: the shortened time it takes acrylic paints to dry. Designed by Golden Artist Colors, Inc. with a hydrophilic acrylic resin, these paints can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, or even weeks, to dry completely, depending on paint thickness, support characteristics, temperature, and humidity.<ref name=\"Patti\">{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Patti|title=rethinking acrylic|date=2008|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=1600610137|page=14}}</ref> \n*'''Iridescent, pearl''' and '''interference acrylic colors''' combine conventional pigments with powdered mica ([[aluminium silicate]]) or powdered bronze to achieve complex visual effects. Colors have shimmering or reflective characteristics, depending on the coarseness or fineness of the powder. Iridescent colors are used in fine arts and crafts. \n*'''Acrylic gouache''' is like traditional [[gouache]] because it dries to a matte, opaque finish. However, unlike traditional gouache, the acrylic binder makes it water-resistant once it dries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walsh |first1=Sarah |title=Playful Painting: People: Whimsical projects and clever techniques |date=August 2018 |publisher=Walter Foster Publishing |isbn=1633224694}}</ref> Like craft paint, it will adhere to a variety of surfaces, not only canvas and paper. This paint is typically used by water-colorists, cartoonists, or illustrators, and for decorative or [[folk art]] applications.\n**Examples of acrylic gouache are Lascaux Gouache and Turner Acryl Gouache. \n*'''Craft acrylics''' can be used on surfaces besides canvas, such as wood, metal, fabrics, and ceramics. They are used in decorative painting techniques and [[Faux painting|faux finishes]] to decorate objects of ordinary life. Although colors can be mixed, pigments are often not specified. Each color line is formulated instead to achieve a wide range of premixed colors. Craft paints usually employ vinyl or PVA resins to increase adhesion and lower cost.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glover |first1=David Lloyd |title=Color Mixing in Acrylic: Learn to Mix Fresh, Vibrant Colors for Still Lifes |date=August 2014 |publisher=Walter Foster Publishing |isbn=1600583881 |page=10}}</ref> \n*'''Interactive acrylics''' are all-purpose acrylic artists' colors which have the characteristic fast-drying nature of artists' acrylics, but are formulated to allow artists to delay drying when they need more working time, or re-wet their work when they want to do more wet blending.\n*'''Exterior acrylics''' are paints that can withstand outdoor conditions. Like craft acrylics, they adhere to many surfaces. They are more resistant to both water and ultraviolet light. This makes them the acrylic of choice for architectural murals, outdoor signs, and many [[Faux finish|faux-finishing techniques]].\n\n=== Differences between acrylic and oil paint ===\n[[File:Small Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of acrylic painting showing finishes that resemble both oil and watercolor|alt=Opaque red/orange square in the upper-right corner looks opaque like oil paint. The textured grey/black area looks like watercolor.]]\nThe vehicle and binder of [[oil paint]]s is [[linseed oil]] (or another [[drying oil]]), whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an [[emulsion]] (suspension) of acrylic polymer, which serves as the binder. Thus, oil paint is said to be \"oil-based\", whereas acrylic paint is \"water-based\" (or sometimes \"water-borne\").\n[[File:Acryl Stilleven met blauwe kan Julien Grandgagnage.jpg|left|thumb|Example of blending technique with acrylics. Painting on wooden panel.]]\n[[File:Acrylic Blending.jpg|thumb|A demonstration of blending with acrylic paint. No retarders were used.|alt=An acrylic painting of a red and blue face in profile lies on top of a tray on a table. Below the painting, on the table, are a palette and various sizes and colors of paint.]]\n\nThe main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over [[underpainting]]s. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of [[acrylic retarder]]s. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.\n\nOil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or [[turpentine]] to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists' use. Oil paint films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of \"[[fat over lean]]\" must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable.\n\nOil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint. As linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment. Oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions, which imparts a unique \"look and feel\" to the resultant paint film. Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics and vice versa, as each medium has different chemical sensitivities. Some historical pigments are alkali sensitive, and therefore cannot be made in an acrylic emulsion; others are just too difficult to formulate.<ref>[http://www.justpaint.org/some-historical-pigments-and-their-replacements/ Some Historical Pigments and Their Replacements] accessed December 18, 2017</ref> Approximate \"hue\" color formulations, that do not contain the historical pigments, are typically offered as substitutes.<ref>[http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/fluid/prussian-blue-hue Prussian Blue Hue (Fluid)] accessed December 18, 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.goldenpaints.com/products/colors/heavy-body/viridian-green-hue Viridian Green Hue (Heavy Body)] accessed December 18, 2017</ref>\n\nDue to acrylic paint's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15\u201320 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of [[wet-in-wet]] technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.\n\nMeanwhile, acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion \u2013 as this binder dries, the paint remains flexible.<ref>Acrylic Paint Common Questions [http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm] Technical Summary of Acrylic Paint accessed December 06, 2010 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101090912/http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm|date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAnother difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints. Acrylics are very useful in mixed media, allowing the use of pastel (oil and chalk), charcoal and pen (among others) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible\u2014sand, rice, and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics. Specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for [[Linoblock|linoblock printing]] (acrylic [[block printing]] ink has been produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), [[Face Painting|face painting]], [[airbrushing]], [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]]-like techniques,  and [[Screen printing|fabric screen printing]].\n\nAnother difference between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup. Acrylic paint can be cleaned out of a brush with any soap, while oil paint needs a specific type to be sure to get all the oil out of the brushes. Also, it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off, whereas one can easily clean wet acrylic paint with water.<ref name=\"Blake1997\">{{cite book|author=Wendon Blake|title=Acrylic Painting: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow2p4mhXyZQC&pg=PA59|year=1997|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-29589-3|pages=59\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Visual arts}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.napauk.com/ National Acrylic Painter's Association]\n* [http://inthelightart.com/fine-art/ Handling and Care Tips for paintings]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Acrylic Paint}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Visual arts materials]]\n[[Category:Painting materials]]\n[[Category:Paints]]\n[[Category:Watermedia]]\n", "name_user": "163.47.158.86", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylic_paint"}

The king asked his colonial secretary, [[Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], to announce that he accepted the gift \"for myself and my successors\" and that he would ensure \"this great and unique diamond be kept and preserved among the historic jewels which form the heirlooms of the Crown\".<ref name=\"field\"/>\n\n===Cutting process===\n[[File:Joseph Asscher splitting the Cullinan diamond.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Asscher making the split]]\nThe king chose [[Royal Asscher Diamond Company|Asscher Brothers]] of [[Amsterdam]] to cleave and polish the rough stone into brilliant gems of various cuts and sizes.

It was approximately {{convert|10.1|cm|in}} long, {{convert|6.35|cm|in}} wide, {{convert|5.9|cm|in}} deep, and weighed {{convert|3106|carat|g|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"rct\">{{cite web|url=https://d9y2r2msyxru0.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/null/press_release_cullinan_1.pdf|title=Jewellery made from the world's largest diamond is to go on display|date=15 May 2012|accessdate=21 December 2017|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105503/https://d9y2r2msyxru0.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/null/press_release_cullinan_1.pdf|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Newspapers called it the \"Cullinan Diamond\", a reference to Sir&nbsp;[[Thomas Cullinan (diamond magnate)|Thomas Cullinan]], who opened the mine in 1902.<ref>Scarratt and Shor, p. 122.</ref> It was three times the size of the [[Excelsior Diamond]], found in 1893 at [[Jagersfontein Mine]], weighing {{convert|972|carat|g}}. Four of its eight surfaces were smooth, indicating that it once had been part of a much larger stone broken up by natural forces. It had a blue-white hue and contained a small pocket of air, which at certain angles produced a rainbow, or [[Newton's rings]].<ref>Hatch, pp. 170\u2013172.</ref>\n\nShortly after its discovery, Cullinan went on public display at the [[Standard Bank (historic)|Standard Bank]] in [[Johannesburg]], where it was seen by an estimated 8,000\u20139,000 visitors. In April 1905, the rough gem was deposited with Premier Mining Co.'s London sales agent, [[Newman baronets#Neumann (later Newman) baronets of Cecil Lodge (1912 \u2013 present)|S. Neumann & Co]].<ref>Scarratt and Shor, p. 123.</ref> Due to its immense value, detectives were assigned to a [[steamboat]] that was rumoured to be carrying the stone, and a parcel was ceremoniously locked in the captain's safe and guarded on the entire journey. It was a diversionary tactic \u2013 the stone on that ship was fake, meant to attract those who would be interested in stealing it. Cullinan was sent to the United Kingdom in a plain box via registered post.<ref>Dickinson, pp. 110\u2013111.</ref> On arriving in London, it was conveyed to [[Buckingham Palace]] for inspection by King [[Edward&nbsp;VII]]. Although it drew considerable interest from potential buyers, Cullinan went unsold for two years.<ref name=\"rct\"/>\n\n===Presentation to Edward VII===\nTransvaal Prime Minister, [[Louis Botha]], suggested buying the diamond for Edward&nbsp;VII as \"a token of the loyalty and attachment of the people of the Transvaal to His Majesty's throne and person\".<ref>Lee, pp. 489\u2013490.</ref> In August 1907, a vote was held in Parliament on the Cullinan's fate, and a motion authorising the purchase was carried by 42 votes in favour to 19 against. Initially, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]], then British Prime Minister, advised the king to decline the offer, but he later decided to let Edward&nbsp;VII choose whether or not to accept the gift.<ref>Helme, p. 86.</ref> Eventually, he was persuaded by [[Winston Churchill]], then Colonial Under-Secretary.

The king asked his colonial secretary, [[Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], to announce that he accepted the gift \"for myself and my successors\" and that he would ensure \"this great and unique diamond be kept and preserved among the historic jewels which form the heirlooms of the Crown\".<ref name=\"field\"/>\n\n===Cutting process===\n[[File:Joseph Asscher splitting the Cullinan diamond.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Asscher making the split]]\nThe king chose [[Royal Asscher Diamond Company|Asscher Brothers]] of [[Amsterdam]] to cleave and polish the rough stone into brilliant gems of various cuts and sizes.
