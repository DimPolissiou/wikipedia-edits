{"title_page": "Operant conditioning", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}{{OperantConditioning}}'''Operant conditioning''' (also called '''instrumental conditioning''') is a type of associative learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment.  It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning. \n\nAlthough operant and [[classical conditioning]] both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior.  For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the sweets inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are \"discriminative stimuli\". Operant behavior is said to be \"voluntary\". The responses are under the control of the organism and are operants. For example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy.\n\nIn contrast, classical conditioning involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. The responses are under the control of some stimulus because they are reflexes, automatically elicited by the appropriate stimuli. For example, sight of sweets may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily \"chosen\".\n\nThe study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning,<ref>Jenkins, H. M. \"Animal Learning and Behavior Theory\" Ch. 5 in Hearst, E. \"The First Century of Experimental Psychology\"  Hillsdale N. J.,  Earlbaum, 1979</ref> and they are still at the core of behavior analysis.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Historical note==\n\n===Thorndike's law of effect===\n{{Main|Law of effect}}\nOperant conditioning, sometimes called ''instrumental learning'', was first extensively studied by [[Edward L. Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Thorndike|first1=E.L.|year=1901|title=Animal intelligence: An experimental study of the associative processes in animals|url=|journal=Psychological Review Monograph Supplement|volume=2|issue=|pages=1\u2013109}}</ref> A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained, the cats took a long time to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thorndike generalized this finding in his [[law of effect]], which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences ''strengthen'' behavior and some consequences ''weaken'' behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal [[learning curve]]s through this procedure.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 9.</ref>\n\nHumans appear to learn many simple behaviors through the sort of process studied by Thorndike, now called operant conditioning. That is, responses are retained when they lead to a successful outcome and discarded when they do not, or when they produce aversive effects. This usually happens without being planned by any \"teacher\", but operant conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years.<ref name=\"parenting\">Miltenberger, R. G., & Crosland, K. A. (2014). Parenting. The wiley blackwell handbook of operant and classical conditioning. (pp. 509\u2013531) Wiley-Blackwell. {{DOI|10.1002/9781118468135.ch20}}</ref>\n\n===B. F. Skinner===\n{{Main|B. F. Skinner}} \n[[B.F. Skinner]] (1904\u20131990) is referred to as the father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His 1938 book \"The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis\",<ref>Skinner, B. F. \"The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis\", 1938 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts</ref> initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of [[Ernst Mach]], Skinner rejected Thorndike's reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|year=1950|title=Are theories of learning necessary?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1272d4ce87b97ac5b12659823206174a8d519b14|journal=Psychological Review|volume=57|issue=4|pages=193\u2013216|doi=10.1037/h0054367|pmid=15440996}}</ref>\n\nSkinner believed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be used to describe something as complex as human behavior. Operant conditioning, in his opinion, better described human behavior as it examined causes and effects of intentional behavior.\n\nTo implement his empirical approach, Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], or \"''Skinner Box''\", in which subjects such as pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli. Unlike Thorndike's puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, and the rate of such responses became Skinner's primary behavioral measure.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. \"B. F. Skinner: The role of reinforcement and Punishment\", subsection in: Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011, 278\u2013288.</ref>  Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ferster, C. B. & Skinner, B. F.  \"Schedules of Reinforcement\", 1957 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts</ref> A reinforcement schedule may be defined as \"any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Staddon|first=J. E. R|author2=D. T Cerutti|date=February 2003|title=Operant Conditioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=115\u2013144|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|pmc=1473025|pmid=12415075}}</ref> The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.<ref>Mecca Chiesa (2004) Radical Behaviorism: The philosophy and the science</ref>\n\nMany of Skinner's writings are devoted to the application of operant conditioning to human behavior.<ref>Skinner, B. F. \"Science and Human Behavior\", 1953. New York: MacMillan</ref>  In 1948 he published ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional account of a peaceful, happy, productive community organized around his conditioning principles.<ref>Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett</ref>  In 1957, [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] published ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'',<ref>Skinner, B. F. \"Verbal Behavior\", 1957. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts</ref> which extended the principles of operant conditioning to language, a form of human behavior that had previously been analyzed quite differently by linguists and others. Skinner defined new functional relationships such as \"mands\" and \"tacts\" to capture some essentials of language, but he introduced no new principles, treating verbal behavior like any other behavior controlled by its consequences, which included the reactions of the speaker's audience.\n\n==Concepts and procedures==\n\n===Origins of operant behavior: operant variability===\nOperant behavior is said to be \"emitted\"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place.  The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a \"new\" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A|year=2002|title=Operant variability: Evidence, functions, and theory|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|volume=9|issue=4|pages=672\u2013705|doi=10.3758/bf03196324|pmid=12613672|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Modifying operant behavior: reinforcement and punishment===\n{{Main|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}\nReinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. \n* '''Positive reinforcement''' and '''negative reinforcement''' increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while '''positive punishment''' and '''negative punishment''' reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. \nAnother procedure is called \"extinction\".\n* '''Extinction''' occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. Occasional reinforcement can lead to an even longer delay before behavior extinction due to the learning factor of repeated instances becoming necessary to get reinforcement, when compared with reinforcement being given at each opportunity before extinction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=B.F. |title=Science and Human Behavior |date=2014 |publisher=The B.F.

Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.|vauthors=Schultz W}}</ref> For example, if a rat in a [[Skinner box]] gets food when it presses a lever, its rate of pressing will go up.  This procedure is usually called simply ''reinforcement''.\n# '''[[Negative reinforcement]]''' (a.k.a. escape) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an [[aversive]] stimulus, thereby increasing the original behavior's frequency. In the Skinner Box experiment, the aversive stimulus might be a loud noise continuously inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat presses a lever to turn off the noise.\n# '''[[Positive punishment]]''' (also referred to as \"punishment by contingent stimulation\") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an aversive stimulus. Example: pain from a [[spanking]], which would often result in a decrease in that behavior. ''Positive punishment'' is a confusing term, so the procedure is usually referred to as \"punishment\".\n# '''[[Negative punishment]]''' (penalty) (also called \"punishment by contingent withdrawal\") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus. Example: taking away a child's toy following an undesired behavior by him/her, which would result in a decrease in the undesirable behavior.\n# '''[[extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been reinforced is no longer effective. Example: a rat is first given food many times for pressing a lever, until the experimenter no longer gives out food as a reward. The rat would typically press the lever less often and then stop. The lever pressing would then be said to be \"extinguished.\"\n\nIt is important to note that actors (e.g. a rat) are not spoken of as being reinforced, punished, or extinguished; it is the ''actions'' that are reinforced, punished, or extinguished. Reinforcement, punishment, and extinction are not terms whose use is restricted to the laboratory. Naturally-occurring consequences can also reinforce, punish, or extinguish behavior and are not always planned or delivered on purpose.\n\n====Schedules of reinforcement====\nSchedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement. The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used<ref>Schacter et al.2011 Psychology 2nd ed. pg.280\u2013284 Reference for entire section Principles version 130317</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n* Fixed interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a \"break-run\" pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.\n* Variable interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.\n* Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.\n* Variable ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.\n* Continuous reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated. The reinforcement is triggered by seeing the stimuli.\n\n====Factors that alter the effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment====\nThe effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment can be changed. \n# '''Satiation/Deprivation''': The effectiveness of a positive or \"appetitive\" stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received enough of that stimulus to satisfy his/her appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the effectiveness of a consequence will then increase. A subject with a full stomach wouldn't feel as motivated as a hungry one.<ref name = Miltenberger84>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 84.</ref>\n# '''Immediacy''': An immediate consequence is more effective than a delayed one. If one gives a dog a treat for sitting within five seconds, the dog will learn faster than if the treat is given after thirty seconds.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 86.</ref>\n# '''Contingency''': To be most effective, reinforcement should occur consistently after responses and not at other times. Learning may be slower if reinforcement is intermittent, that is, following only some instances of the same response. Responses reinforced intermittently are usually slower to extinguish than are responses that have always been reinforced.<ref name = Miltenberger84/>\n# '''Size''': The size, or amount, of a stimulus often affects its potency as a reinforcer. Humans and animals engage in cost-benefit analysis. If a lever press brings ten food pellets, lever pressing may be learned more rapidly than if a press brings only one pellet.   A pile of quarters from a slot machine may keep a gambler pulling the lever longer than a single quarter.\n\nMost of these factors serve biological functions.  For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment ([[homeostasis]]). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is an effective reinforcer. When the organism's [[blood sugar]] reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective or even aversive.\n\n====Shaping====\n{{main|Shaping (psychology)}}\nShaping is a conditioning method much used in animal training and in teaching nonverbal humans. It depends on operant variability and reinforcement, as described above. The trainer starts by identifying the desired final (or \"target\") behavior. Next, the trainer chooses a behavior that the animal or person already emits with some probability. The form of this behavior is then gradually changed across successive trials by reinforcing behaviors that approximate the target behavior more and more closely. When the target behavior is finally emitted, it may be strengthened and maintained by the use of a schedule of reinforcement.\n\n====Noncontingent reinforcement====\nNoncontingent reinforcement is the delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism's behavior. Noncontingent reinforcement may be used in an attempt to reduce an undesired target behavior by reinforcing multiple alternative responses while extinguishing the target response.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=M.|last2=Sigafoos|first2=J.|last3=Bushell|first3=H.|year=1998|title=Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=22|issue=4|pages=529\u2013547|doi=10.1177/01454455980224005|pmid=9755650}}</ref> As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent \"reinforcement\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poling|first1=A.|last2=Normand|first2=M.|year=1999|title=Noncontingent reinforcement: an inappropriate description of time-based schedules that reduce behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=32|issue=2|pages=237\u2013238|doi=10.1901/jaba.1999.32-237|pmc=1284187}}</ref>\n\n===Stimulus control of operant behavior===\n{{main|Stimulus control}}\nThough initially operant behavior is emitted without an identified reference to a particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come under the control of stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called \"discriminative stimuli.\" A so-called \"[[three-term contingency]]\" is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Example: a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of his/her food bag; a child reaches for candy when s/he sees it on a table.\n\n====Discrimination, generalization & context====\nMost behavior is under stimulus control. Several aspects of this may be distinguished: \n*'''Discrimination''' typically occurs when a response is reinforced only in the presence of a specific stimulus. For example, a pigeon might be fed for pecking at a red light and not at a green light; in consequence, it pecks at red and stops pecking at green.  Many complex combinations of stimuli and other conditions have been studied; for example an organism might be reinforced on an interval schedule in the presence of one stimulus and on a ratio schedule in the presence of another. \n*'''Generalization''' is the tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to a previously trained discriminative stimulus. For example, having been trained to peck at \"red\" a pigeon might also peck at \"pink\", though usually less strongly.\n*'''Context''' refers to stimuli that are continuously present in a situation, like the walls, tables, chairs, etc. in a room, or the interior of an operant conditioning chamber. Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly.  Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another.  This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur in other situations.\n\n===Behavioral sequences: conditioned reinforcement and chaining===\nMost behavior cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one. The scope of operant analysis is expanded through the idea of behavioral chains, which are sequences of responses bound together by the three-term contingencies defined above.  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a \"conditioned reinforcer\". For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce \"turning around\" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence \"noise \u2013 turn-around \u2013 light \u2013 press lever \u2013 food\". Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.\n\n===Escape and avoidance===\nIn escape learning, a behavior terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding one's eyes from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light in one's eyes.  (This is an example of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called \"avoidance,\"  as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors.  Avoidance behavior raises the so-called \"avoidance paradox\", for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).\n\nTwo kinds of experimental settings are commonly used: discriminated and free-operant avoidance learning.\n\n====Discriminated avoidance learning====\nA discriminated avoidance experiment involves a series of trials in which a neutral stimulus such as a light is followed by an aversive stimulus such as a shock. After the neutral stimulus appears an operant response such as a lever press prevents or terminate the aversive stimulus. In early trials, the subject does not make the response until the aversive stimulus has come on, so these early trials are called \"escape\" trials. As learning progresses, the subject begins to respond during the neutral stimulus and thus prevents the aversive stimulus from occurring. Such trials are called \"avoidance trials.\" This experiment is said to involve classical conditioning because a neutral CS (conditioned stimulus) is paired with the aversive US (unconditioned stimulus); this idea underlies the two-factor theory of avoidance learning described below.\n\n====Free-operant avoidance learning====\nIn free-operant avoidance a subject periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays the onset of the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence of a response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays the onset of the next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.\n\n====Two-process theory of avoidance====\n\nThis theory was originally proposed in order to explain discriminated avoidance learning, in which an organism learns to avoid an aversive stimulus by escaping from a signal for that stimulus. Two processes are involved: classical conditioning of the signal followed by operant conditioning of the escape response:\n\na) ''Classical conditioning of fear.'' Initially the organism experiences the pairing of a CS with an aversive US. The theory assumes that this pairing creates an association between the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) \u2013 \"fear.\" b) ''Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction.'' As a result of the first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. Note that the theory does not say that the organism \"avoids\" the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism \"escapes\" an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.\nSeveral experimental findings seem to run counter to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see [[Classical conditioning]]). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.<ref name=\"Pierce 2004\">Pierce & Cheney (2004) Behavior Analysis and Learning</ref>\n\n====Operant or \"one-factor\" theory====\nSome theorists suggest that avoidance behavior may simply be a special case of operant behavior maintained by its consequences. In this view the idea of \"consequences\" is expanded to include sensitivity to a pattern of events. Thus, in avoidance, the consequence of a response is a reduction in the rate of aversive stimulation. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that a \"missed shock\" is detected as a stimulus, and can act as a reinforcer. Cognitive theories of avoidance take this idea a step farther. For example, a rat comes to \"expect\" shock if it fails to press a lever and to \"expect no shock\" if it presses it, and avoidance behavior is strengthened if these expectancies are confirmed.<ref name=\"Pierce 2004\"/>\n\n===Operant hoarding===\nOperant hoarding refers to the observation that rats reinforced in a certain way may allow food pellets to accumulate in a food tray instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of [[extinction]] during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations in which there is a choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay.

[[Cholinergic]] projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the [[primary visual cortex]]. A study of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement.<ref>Michael J. Frank, Lauren C. Seeberger, and Randall C. O'Reilly (2004) \"By Carrot or by Stick: Cognitive Reinforcement Learning in Parkinsonism,\" ''Science'' 4, November 2004</ref> It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.\n\nA neurochemical process involving dopamine has been suggested to underlie reinforcement.  When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, [[dopamine]] pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways \"releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many [[dendrites]], thus broadcasting a global reinforcement signal to [[postsynaptic neuron]]s.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|year=1998|title=Predictive Reward Signal of Dopamine Neurons|url=|journal=The Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1\u201327|doi=10.1152/jn.1998.80.1.1|pmid=9658025}}</ref> This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the probability of occurrence for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, the most likely to have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.\n\n==Questions about the law of effect==\nA number of observations seem to show that operant behavior can be established without reinforcement in the sense defined above. Most cited is the phenomenon of [[Shaping (psychology)#Autoshaping|autoshaping]]  (sometimes called \"sign tracking\"), in which a stimulus is repeatedly followed by reinforcement, and in consequence the animal begins to respond to the stimulus. For example, a response key is lighted and then food is presented. When this is repeated a few times a pigeon subject begins to peck the key even though food comes whether the bird pecks or not. Similarly, rats begin to handle small objects, such as a lever, when food is presented nearby.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Timberlake|first1=W|year=1983|title=Rats' responses to a moving object related to food or water: A behavior-systems analysis|url=|journal=Animal Learning & Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=309\u2013320|doi=10.3758/bf03199781|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A.J.|year=1969|title=Animals respond for food in the presence of free food|url=|journal=Science|volume=166|issue=3903|pages=399\u2013401|doi=10.1126/science.166.3903.399|pmid=5812041|bibcode=1969Sci...166..399N}}</ref> Strikingly, pigeons and rats persist in this behavior even when pecking the key or pressing the lever leads to less food (omission training).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D.R.|last2=Williams|first2=H.|year=1969|title=Auto-maintenance in the pigeon: sustained pecking despite contingent non-reinforcement|url=|journal= Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=12|issue=4|pages=511\u2013520|doi=10.1901/jeab.1969.12-511|pmid=16811370|pmc=1338642}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peden|first1=B.F.|last2=Brown|first2=M.P.|last3=Hearst|first3=E.|year=1977|title=Persistent approaches to a signal for food despite food omission for approaching.|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes|volume=3|issue=4|pages=377\u2013399|doi=10.1037/0097-7403.3.4.377}}</ref> Another apparent operant behavior that appears without reinforcement is [[contrafreeloading]].\n\nThese observations and others appear to contradict the [[law of effect]], and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement  (e.g.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R.A.|last2=Gardner|first2=B.T.|year=1988|title=Feedforward vs feedbackward: An ethological alternative to the law of effect|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=11|issue=3|pages=429\u2013447|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00058258}}</ref><ref>Gardner, R.

The following are some examples.\n\n===Addiction and dependence===\n\nPositive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence]]. An addictive drug is [[reward system|intrinsically rewarding]]; that is, it functions as [[#Primary reinforcers|a primary positive reinforcer]] of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it [[incentive salience]] (i.e., it is \"wanted\" or \"desired\"),<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\">{{cite book|year=2016|title=Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder|journal=Prog.

Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&nbsp;...<br />An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&nbsp;...<br />Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an \u201cescape\u201d response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).|vauthors=Edwards S|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444635457}}</ref><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\">{{cite journal|date=April 2012|title=From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation|journal=Eur.

The CS even takes on some incentive properties similar to its UCS. An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to \u2018consume\u2019 the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). \u2018Wanting\u2019 of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).|vauthors=Berridge KC}}</ref><ref name=\"Pleasure system - incentive sensitization\">{{cite journal|date=May 2015|title=Pleasure systems in the brain|journal=Neuron|volume=86|issue=3|pages=646\u2013664|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018|pmc=4425246|pmid=25950633|quote=An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense \u2018wanting\u2019 (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more \u2018wanted\u2019 than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more \u2018wanted\u2019 more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify \u2018wanting\u2019 (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing \u2018liking\u2019 tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML}}</ref> so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use&nbsp;\u2013 become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug.<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Pleasure system - incentive sensitization\" /> These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become [[#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of continued use.<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Pleasure system - incentive sensitization\" /> Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.\n\nIn drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is [[self-administration|self-administered]] in order to alleviate or \"escape\" the symptoms of [[physical dependence]] (e.g., [[tremor]]s and sweating) and/or [[psychological dependence]] (e.g., [[anhedonia]], restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of [[drug withdrawal]].<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" />\n\n===Animal training===\n{{main|Animal training}}\nAnimal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are the following: \n(a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); \n(b) the use of secondary reinforcement, (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); \n(c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; \n(d) shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; \n(e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; \n(f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.<ref>McGreevy, P & Boakes, R.\"Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training\".(Sydney: \"Sydney University Press\"., 2011)</ref>\n\nExample of animal training from Seaworld related on Operant conditioning \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://seaworld.org/en/animal-info/animal-infobooks/animal-training/animal-training-basics|website=Animal training basics|publisher=Seaworld parks|title=All About Animal Training - Basics &#124; SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nAnimal training has effects on positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement.

F. Skinner]] that applies the principles of conditioning to the modification of socially significant human behavior. It uses the basic concepts of conditioning theory, including conditioned stimulus (S<sup>C</sup>), discriminative stimulus (S<sup>d</sup>), response (R), and reinforcing stimulus (S<sup>rein</sup> or S<sup>r</sup> for reinforcers, sometimes S<sup>ave</sup> for aversive stimuli).<ref name=\"Pierce 2004\"/> A conditioned stimulus controls behaviors developed through respondent (classical) conditioning, such as emotional reactions. The other three terms combine to form Skinner's \"three-term contingency\": a discriminative stimulus sets the occasion for responses that lead to reinforcement. Researchers have found the following protocol to be effective when they use the tools of operant conditioning to modify human behavior:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n# '''State goal'''  Clarify exactly what changes are to be brought about. For example, \"reduce weight by 30 pounds.\"\n# '''Monitor behavior'''  Keep track of behavior so that one can see whether the desired effects are occurring. For example, keep a chart of daily weights.\n# '''Reinforce desired behavior'''  For example, congratulate the individual on weight losses.  With humans, a record of behavior may serve as a reinforcement. For example, when a participant sees a pattern of weight loss, this may reinforce continuance in a behavioral weight-loss program. However, individuals may perceive reinforcement which is intended to be positive as negative and vice versa. For example, a record of weight loss may act as negative  reinforcement if it reminds the individual how heavy they actually are. The [[token economy]], [[token economy|is]] an exchange system in which tokens are given as rewards for desired behaviors.  Tokens may later be exchanged for a desired prize or rewards such as power, prestige, goods or services.\n# '''Reduce [[incentive]]s to perform undesirable behavior'''  For example, remove candy and fatty snacks from kitchen shelves.\n\nPractitioners of applied behavior analysis (ABA) bring these procedures, and many variations and developments of them, to bear on a variety of socially significant behaviors and issues. In many cases, practitioners use operant techniques to develop constructive, socially acceptable behaviors to replace aberrant behaviors.

In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called \"the price elasticity of demand.\" Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other everyday consumables may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.<ref>Domjan, M. (2009).

The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim's options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim's ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency...The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim's capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression.

It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning. \n\nAlthough operant and [[classical conditioning]] both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior.  For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the sweets inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are \"discriminative stimuli\". Operant behavior is said to be \"voluntary\". The responses are under the control of the organism and are operants. For example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy.\n\nIn contrast, classical conditioning involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. The responses are under the control of some stimulus because they are reflexes, automatically elicited by the appropriate stimuli. For example, sight of sweets may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily \"chosen\".\n\nThe study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning,<ref>Jenkins, H. M. \"Animal Learning and Behavior Theory\" Ch. 5 in Hearst, E. \"The First Century of Experimental Psychology\"  Hillsdale N. J.,  Earlbaum, 1979</ref> and they are still at the core of behavior analysis.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Historical note==\n\n===Thorndike's law of effect===\n{{Main|Law of effect}}\nOperant conditioning, sometimes called ''instrumental learning'', was first extensively studied by [[Edward L. Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Thorndike|first1=E.L.|year=1901|title=Animal intelligence: An experimental study of the associative processes in animals|url=|journal=Psychological Review Monograph Supplement|volume=2|issue=|pages=1\u2013109}}</ref> A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained, the cats took a long time to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thorndike generalized this finding in his [[law of effect]], which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences ''strengthen'' behavior and some consequences ''weaken'' behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal [[learning curve]]s through this procedure.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 9.</ref>\n\nHumans appear to learn many simple behaviors through the sort of process studied by Thorndike, now called operant conditioning. That is, responses are retained when they lead to a successful outcome and discarded when they do not, or when they produce aversive effects. This usually happens without being planned by any \"teacher\", but operant conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years.<ref name=\"parenting\">Miltenberger, R.

Skinner===\n{{Main|B. F. Skinner}} \n[[B.F. Skinner]] (1904\u20131990) is referred to as the father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His 1938 book \"The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis\",<ref>Skinner, B. F. \"The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis\", 1938 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts</ref> initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of [[Ernst Mach]], Skinner rejected Thorndike's reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|year=1950|title=Are theories of learning necessary?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1272d4ce87b97ac5b12659823206174a8d519b14|journal=Psychological Review|volume=57|issue=4|pages=193\u2013216|doi=10.1037/h0054367|pmid=15440996}}</ref>\n\nSkinner believed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be used to describe something as complex as human behavior. Operant conditioning, in his opinion, better described human behavior as it examined causes and effects of intentional behavior.\n\nTo implement his empirical approach, Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], or \"''Skinner Box''\", in which subjects such as pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli. Unlike Thorndike's puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, and the rate of such responses became Skinner's primary behavioral measure.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. \"B. F. Skinner: The role of reinforcement and Punishment\", subsection in: Psychology; Second Edition.

He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.<ref>Mecca Chiesa (2004) Radical Behaviorism: The philosophy and the science</ref>\n\nMany of Skinner's writings are devoted to the application of operant conditioning to human behavior.<ref>Skinner, B. F. \"Science and Human Behavior\", 1953. New York: MacMillan</ref>  In 1948 he published ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional account of a peaceful, happy, productive community organized around his conditioning principles.<ref>Skinner, B.F.

New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts</ref> which extended the principles of operant conditioning to language, a form of human behavior that had previously been analyzed quite differently by linguists and others. Skinner defined new functional relationships such as \"mands\" and \"tacts\" to capture some essentials of language, but he introduced no new principles, treating verbal behavior like any other behavior controlled by its consequences, which included the reactions of the speaker's audience.\n\n==Concepts and procedures==\n\n===Origins of operant behavior: operant variability===\nOperant behavior is said to be \"emitted\"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place.  The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a \"new\" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A|year=2002|title=Operant variability: Evidence, functions, and theory|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|volume=9|issue=4|pages=672\u2013705|doi=10.3758/bf03196324|pmid=12613672|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Modifying operant behavior: reinforcement and punishment===\n{{Main|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}\nReinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. \n* '''Positive reinforcement''' and '''negative reinforcement''' increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while '''positive punishment''' and '''negative punishment''' reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. \nAnother procedure is called \"extinction\".\n* '''Extinction''' occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. Occasional reinforcement can lead to an even longer delay before behavior extinction due to the learning factor of repeated instances becoming necessary to get reinforcement, when compared with reinforcement being given at each opportunity before extinction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=B.F. |title=Science and Human Behavior |date=2014 |publisher=The B.F.

Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.|vauthors=Schultz W}}</ref> For example, if a rat in a [[Skinner box]] gets food when it presses a lever, its rate of pressing will go up.  This procedure is usually called simply ''reinforcement''.\n# '''[[Negative reinforcement]]''' (a.k.a. escape) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an [[aversive]] stimulus, thereby increasing the original behavior's frequency. In the Skinner Box experiment, the aversive stimulus might be a loud noise continuously inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat presses a lever to turn off the noise.\n# '''[[Positive punishment]]''' (also referred to as \"punishment by contingent stimulation\") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an aversive stimulus. Example: pain from a [[spanking]], which would often result in a decrease in that behavior. ''Positive punishment'' is a confusing term, so the procedure is usually referred to as \"punishment\".\n# '''[[Negative punishment]]''' (penalty) (also called \"punishment by contingent withdrawal\") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus. Example: taking away a child's toy following an undesired behavior by him/her, which would result in a decrease in the undesirable behavior.\n# '''[[extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been reinforced is no longer effective. Example: a rat is first given food many times for pressing a lever, until the experimenter no longer gives out food as a reward. The rat would typically press the lever less often and then stop. The lever pressing would then be said to be \"extinguished.\"\n\nIt is important to note that actors (e.g. a rat) are not spoken of as being reinforced, punished, or extinguished; it is the ''actions'' that are reinforced, punished, or extinguished. Reinforcement, punishment, and extinction are not terms whose use is restricted to the laboratory. Naturally-occurring consequences can also reinforce, punish, or extinguish behavior and are not always planned or delivered on purpose.\n\n====Schedules of reinforcement====\nSchedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement. The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used<ref>Schacter et al.2011 Psychology 2nd ed. pg.280\u2013284 Reference for entire section Principles version 130317</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n* Fixed interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a \"break-run\" pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.\n* Variable interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.\n* Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.\n* Variable ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.\n* Continuous reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated.\n\n====Factors that alter the effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment====\nThe effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment can be changed. \n# '''Satiation/Deprivation''': The effectiveness of a positive or \"appetitive\" stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received enough of that stimulus to satisfy his/her appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the effectiveness of a consequence will then increase. A subject with a full stomach wouldn't feel as motivated as a hungry one.<ref name = Miltenberger84>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 84.</ref>\n# '''Immediacy''': An immediate consequence is more effective than a delayed one. If one gives a dog a treat for sitting within five seconds, the dog will learn faster than if the treat is given after thirty seconds.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 86.</ref>\n# '''Contingency''': To be most effective, reinforcement should occur consistently after responses and not at other times. Learning may be slower if reinforcement is intermittent, that is, following only some instances of the same response. Responses reinforced intermittently are usually slower to extinguish than are responses that have always been reinforced.<ref name = Miltenberger84/>\n# '''Size''': The size, or amount, of a stimulus often affects its potency as a reinforcer. Humans and animals engage in cost-benefit analysis. If a lever press brings ten food pellets, lever pressing may be learned more rapidly than if a press brings only one pellet.   A pile of quarters from a slot machine may keep a gambler pulling the lever longer than a single quarter.\n\nMost of these factors serve biological functions.  For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment ([[homeostasis]]). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is an effective reinforcer. When the organism's [[blood sugar]] reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective or even aversive.\n\n====Shaping====\n{{main|Shaping (psychology)}}\nShaping is a conditioning method much used in animal training and in teaching nonverbal humans. It depends on operant variability and reinforcement, as described above. The trainer starts by identifying the desired final (or \"target\") behavior. Next, the trainer chooses a behavior that the animal or person already emits with some probability. The form of this behavior is then gradually changed across successive trials by reinforcing behaviors that approximate the target behavior more and more closely. When the target behavior is finally emitted, it may be strengthened and maintained by the use of a schedule of reinforcement.\n\n====Noncontingent reinforcement====\nNoncontingent reinforcement is the delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism's behavior. Noncontingent reinforcement may be used in an attempt to reduce an undesired target behavior by reinforcing multiple alternative responses while extinguishing the target response.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=M.|last2=Sigafoos|first2=J.|last3=Bushell|first3=H.|year=1998|title=Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=22|issue=4|pages=529\u2013547|doi=10.1177/01454455980224005|pmid=9755650}}</ref> As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent \"reinforcement\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poling|first1=A.|last2=Normand|first2=M.|year=1999|title=Noncontingent reinforcement: an inappropriate description of time-based schedules that reduce behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=32|issue=2|pages=237\u2013238|doi=10.1901/jaba.1999.32-237|pmc=1284187}}</ref>\n\n===Stimulus control of operant behavior===\n{{main|Stimulus control}}\nThough initially operant behavior is emitted without an identified reference to a particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come under the control of stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called \"discriminative stimuli.\" A so-called \"[[three-term contingency]]\" is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Example: a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of his/her food bag; a child reaches for candy when s/he sees it on a table.\n\n====Discrimination, generalization & context====\nMost behavior is under stimulus control. Several aspects of this may be distinguished: \n*'''Discrimination''' typically occurs when a response is reinforced only in the presence of a specific stimulus. For example, a pigeon might be fed for pecking at a red light and not at a green light; in consequence, it pecks at red and stops pecking at green.  Many complex combinations of stimuli and other conditions have been studied; for example an organism might be reinforced on an interval schedule in the presence of one stimulus and on a ratio schedule in the presence of another. \n*'''Generalization''' is the tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to a previously trained discriminative stimulus. For example, having been trained to peck at \"red\" a pigeon might also peck at \"pink\", though usually less strongly.\n*'''Context''' refers to stimuli that are continuously present in a situation, like the walls, tables, chairs, etc. in a room, or the interior of an operant conditioning chamber. Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly.  Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another.  This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur in other situations.\n\n===Behavioral sequences: conditioned reinforcement and chaining===\nMost behavior cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one. The scope of operant analysis is expanded through the idea of behavioral chains, which are sequences of responses bound together by the three-term contingencies defined above.  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a \"conditioned reinforcer\". For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce \"turning around\" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence \"noise \u2013 turn-around \u2013 light \u2013 press lever \u2013 food\". Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.\n\n===Escape and avoidance===\nIn escape learning, a behavior terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding one's eyes from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light in one's eyes.  (This is an example of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called \"avoidance,\"  as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors.  Avoidance behavior raises the so-called \"avoidance paradox\", for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).\n\nTwo kinds of experimental settings are commonly used: discriminated and free-operant avoidance learning.\n\n====Discriminated avoidance learning====\nA discriminated avoidance experiment involves a series of trials in which a neutral stimulus such as a light is followed by an aversive stimulus such as a shock. After the neutral stimulus appears an operant response such as a lever press prevents or terminate the aversive stimulus. In early trials, the subject does not make the response until the aversive stimulus has come on, so these early trials are called \"escape\" trials. As learning progresses, the subject begins to respond during the neutral stimulus and thus prevents the aversive stimulus from occurring. Such trials are called \"avoidance trials.\" This experiment is said to involve classical conditioning because a neutral CS (conditioned stimulus) is paired with the aversive US (unconditioned stimulus); this idea underlies the two-factor theory of avoidance learning described below.\n\n====Free-operant avoidance learning====\nIn free-operant avoidance a subject periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays the onset of the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence of a response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays the onset of the next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.\n\n====Two-process theory of avoidance====\n\nThis theory was originally proposed in order to explain discriminated avoidance learning, in which an organism learns to avoid an aversive stimulus by escaping from a signal for that stimulus. Two processes are involved: classical conditioning of the signal followed by operant conditioning of the escape response:\n\na) ''Classical conditioning of fear.'' Initially the organism experiences the pairing of a CS with an aversive US. The theory assumes that this pairing creates an association between the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) \u2013 \"fear.\" b) ''Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction.'' As a result of the first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. Note that the theory does not say that the organism \"avoids\" the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism \"escapes\" an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.\nSeveral experimental findings seem to run counter to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see [[Classical conditioning]]). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.<ref name=\"Pierce 2004\">Pierce & Cheney (2004) Behavior Analysis and Learning</ref>\n\n====Operant or \"one-factor\" theory====\nSome theorists suggest that avoidance behavior may simply be a special case of operant behavior maintained by its consequences. In this view the idea of \"consequences\" is expanded to include sensitivity to a pattern of events. Thus, in avoidance, the consequence of a response is a reduction in the rate of aversive stimulation. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that a \"missed shock\" is detected as a stimulus, and can act as a reinforcer. Cognitive theories of avoidance take this idea a step farther. For example, a rat comes to \"expect\" shock if it fails to press a lever and to \"expect no shock\" if it presses it, and avoidance behavior is strengthened if these expectancies are confirmed.<ref name=\"Pierce 2004\"/>\n\n===Operant hoarding===\nOperant hoarding refers to the observation that rats reinforced in a certain way may allow food pellets to accumulate in a food tray instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of [[extinction]] during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations in which there is a choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay. See [[schedules of reinforcement]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=M.R.|year=1990|title=Operant hoarding: A new paradigm for the study of self-control|url=|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=53|issue=2|pages=247\u2013262|doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.53-247|pmid=2324665|pmc=1323010}}</ref>\n\n==Neurobiological correlates==\n{{Further|Reward system}}\nThe first scientific studies identifying [[neuron]]s that responded in ways that suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong<ref>[http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/citation/34/3/414 \"Activity of pallidal neurons during movement\"], M.R.

Richardson.<ref name=RTR&MRD/> They showed that [[nucleus basalis]] neurons, which release [[Acetylcholine#Neuromodulatory Effects|acetylcholine]] broadly throughout the [[cerebral cortex]], are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and have been shown to be related to [[neuroplasticity]] in many [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions.<ref>PNAS 93:11219-24 1996, Science 279:1714\u20138 1998</ref> Evidence also exists that [[Dopamine#Functions in the brain|dopamine]] is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and aversive learning.<ref>Neuron 63:244\u2013253, 2009, Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, 3: Article 13, 2009</ref> Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto [[frontal cortex]] regions. [[Cholinergic]] projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the [[primary visual cortex]]. A study of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement.<ref>Michael J. Frank, Lauren C. Seeberger, and Randall C. O'Reilly (2004) \"By Carrot or by Stick: Cognitive Reinforcement Learning in Parkinsonism,\" ''Science'' 4, November 2004</ref> It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.\n\nA neurochemical process involving dopamine has been suggested to underlie reinforcement.  When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, [[dopamine]] pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways \"releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many [[dendrites]], thus broadcasting a global reinforcement signal to [[postsynaptic neuron]]s.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|year=1998|title=Predictive Reward Signal of Dopamine Neurons|url=|journal=The Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1\u201327|doi=10.1152/jn.1998.80.1.1|pmid=9658025}}</ref> This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the probability of occurrence for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, the most likely to have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.\n\n==Questions about the law of effect==\nA number of observations seem to show that operant behavior can be established without reinforcement in the sense defined above. Most cited is the phenomenon of [[Shaping (psychology)#Autoshaping|autoshaping]]  (sometimes called \"sign tracking\"), in which a stimulus is repeatedly followed by reinforcement, and in consequence the animal begins to respond to the stimulus. For example, a response key is lighted and then food is presented. When this is repeated a few times a pigeon subject begins to peck the key even though food comes whether the bird pecks or not. Similarly, rats begin to handle small objects, such as a lever, when food is presented nearby.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Timberlake|first1=W|year=1983|title=Rats' responses to a moving object related to food or water: A behavior-systems analysis|url=|journal=Animal Learning & Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=309\u2013320|doi=10.3758/bf03199781|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A.J.|year=1969|title=Animals respond for food in the presence of free food|url=|journal=Science|volume=166|issue=3903|pages=399\u2013401|doi=10.1126/science.166.3903.399|pmid=5812041|bibcode=1969Sci...166..399N}}</ref> Strikingly, pigeons and rats persist in this behavior even when pecking the key or pressing the lever leads to less food (omission training).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D.R.|last2=Williams|first2=H.|year=1969|title=Auto-maintenance in the pigeon: sustained pecking despite contingent non-reinforcement|url=|journal= Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=12|issue=4|pages=511\u2013520|doi=10.1901/jeab.1969.12-511|pmid=16811370|pmc=1338642}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peden|first1=B.F.|last2=Brown|first2=M.P.|last3=Hearst|first3=E.|year=1977|title=Persistent approaches to a signal for food despite food omission for approaching.|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes|volume=3|issue=4|pages=377\u2013399|doi=10.1037/0097-7403.3.4.377}}</ref> Another apparent operant behavior that appears without reinforcement is [[contrafreeloading]].\n\nThese observations and others appear to contradict the [[law of effect]], and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement  (e.g.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R.A.|last2=Gardner|first2=B.T.|year=1988|title=Feedforward vs feedbackward: An ethological alternative to the law of effect|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=11|issue=3|pages=429\u2013447|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00058258}}</ref><ref>Gardner, R.

In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter's task is to work out how these interact.<ref>Locurto, C.

The following are some examples.\n\n===Addiction and dependence===\n\nPositive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence]]. An addictive drug is [[reward system|intrinsically rewarding]]; that is, it functions as [[#Primary reinforcers|a primary positive reinforcer]] of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it [[incentive salience]] (i.e., it is \"wanted\" or \"desired\"),<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\">{{cite book|year=2016|title=Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder|journal=Prog.

Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&nbsp;...<br />An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&nbsp;...<br />Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an \u201cescape\u201d response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).|vauthors=Edwards S|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444635457}}</ref><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\">{{cite journal|date=April 2012|title=From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation|journal=Eur.

This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience. The CS becomes hard not to look at (Wiers & Stacy, 2006; Hickey et al., 2010a; Piech et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2011). The CS even takes on some incentive properties similar to its UCS. An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to \u2018consume\u2019 the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). \u2018Wanting\u2019 of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).|vauthors=Berridge KC}}</ref><ref name=\"Pleasure system - incentive sensitization\">{{cite journal|date=May 2015|title=Pleasure systems in the brain|journal=Neuron|volume=86|issue=3|pages=646\u2013664|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018|pmc=4425246|pmid=25950633|quote=An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense \u2018wanting\u2019 (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more \u2018wanted\u2019 than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more \u2018wanted\u2019 more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify \u2018wanting\u2019 (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing \u2018liking\u2019 tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML}}</ref> so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use&nbsp;\u2013 become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug.<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Pleasure system - incentive sensitization\" /> These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become [[#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of continued use.<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Pleasure system - incentive sensitization\" /> Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.\n\nIn drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is [[self-administration|self-administered]] in order to alleviate or \"escape\" the symptoms of [[physical dependence]] (e.g., [[tremor]]s and sweating) and/or [[psychological dependence]] (e.g., [[anhedonia]], restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of [[drug withdrawal]].<ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" />\n\n===Animal training===\n{{main|Animal training}}\nAnimal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are the following: \n(a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); \n(b) the use of secondary reinforcement, (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); \n(c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; \n(d) shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; \n(e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; \n(f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.<ref>McGreevy, P & Boakes, R.\"Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training\".(Sydney: \"Sydney University Press\"., 2011)</ref>\n\nExample of animal training from Seaworld related on Operant conditioning \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://seaworld.org/en/animal-info/animal-infobooks/animal-training/animal-training-basics|website=Animal training basics|publisher=Seaworld parks|title=All About Animal Training - Basics &#124; SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nAnimal training has effects on positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Schedules of reinforcements may play a big role on the animal training case.\n\n===Applied behavior analysis===\n{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}\nApplied behavior analysis is the discipline initiated by [[B. F. Skinner]] that applies the principles of conditioning to the modification of socially significant human behavior. It uses the basic concepts of conditioning theory, including conditioned stimulus (S<sup>C</sup>), discriminative stimulus (S<sup>d</sup>), response (R), and reinforcing stimulus (S<sup>rein</sup> or S<sup>r</sup> for reinforcers, sometimes S<sup>ave</sup> for aversive stimuli).<ref name=\"Pierce 2004\"/> A conditioned stimulus controls behaviors developed through respondent (classical) conditioning, such as emotional reactions. The other three terms combine to form Skinner's \"three-term contingency\": a discriminative stimulus sets the occasion for responses that lead to reinforcement. Researchers have found the following protocol to be effective when they use the tools of operant conditioning to modify human behavior:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n# '''State goal'''  Clarify exactly what changes are to be brought about. For example, \"reduce weight by 30 pounds.\"\n# '''Monitor behavior'''  Keep track of behavior so that one can see whether the desired effects are occurring. For example, keep a chart of daily weights.\n# '''Reinforce desired behavior'''  For example, congratulate the individual on weight losses.  With humans, a record of behavior may serve as a reinforcement. For example, when a participant sees a pattern of weight loss, this may reinforce continuance in a behavioral weight-loss program. However, individuals may perceive reinforcement which is intended to be positive as negative and vice versa. For example, a record of weight loss may act as negative  reinforcement if it reminds the individual how heavy they actually are. The [[token economy]], [[token economy|is]] an exchange system in which tokens are given as rewards for desired behaviors.  Tokens may later be exchanged for a desired prize or rewards such as power, prestige, goods or services.\n# '''Reduce [[incentive]]s to perform undesirable behavior'''  For example, remove candy and fatty snacks from kitchen shelves.\n\nPractitioners of applied behavior analysis (ABA) bring these procedures, and many variations and developments of them, to bear on a variety of socially significant behaviors and issues. In many cases, practitioners use operant techniques to develop constructive, socially acceptable behaviors to replace aberrant behaviors.  The techniques of ABA have been effectively applied in to such things as [[Lovaas model|early intensive behavioral interventions]] for children with an [[autism spectrum disorders|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD)<ref name=\"As-in-ABA\">{{cite journal|author1=Dillenburger, K.|author2=Keenan, M.|year=2009|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths|journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193\u201395|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}</ref> research on the principles influencing [[criminology|criminal behavior]], HIV prevention,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=DeVries, J.E.|author2=Burnette, M.M.|author3=Redmon, W.K.|year=1991|title=AIDS prevention: Improving nurses' compliance with glove wearing through performance feedback|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=24|issue=4|pages=705\u201311|doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-705|pmc=1279627|pmid=1797773}}</ref> conservation of natural resources,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Brothers, K.J.|author2=Krantz, P.J.|author3=McClannahan, L.E.|year=1994|title=Office paper recycling: A function of container proximity|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=27|issue=1|pages=153\u201360|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-153|pmc=1297784|pmid=16795821}}</ref> education,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Dardig, Jill C.|author2=Heward, William L.|author3=Heron, Timothy E.|author4=Nancy A.

The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim's options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim's ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency...The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim's capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression.

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]] and the sixth and penultimate novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. Set during [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s sixth year at [[Hogwarts]], the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, [[Lord Voldemort]], and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] and in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold nine million copies in the first 24&nbsp;hours after its release, a record that was eventually broken by its sequel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right to read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 [[British Book of the Year]] award.\n\nReviewers noted that the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes to be love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\nThe [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film adaptation]] of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' was released 15 July 2009 by [[Warner Bros]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not add extensive or in-universe content. It should be understandable to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Harry Potter-->\n\n[[Severus Snape]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], meets with [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s mother, and her sister [[Death Eater#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Lord Voldemort]]'s faithful supporter. Narcissa expresses her concern that her son might not survive a dangerous mission given him by [[Lord Voldemort]]. Bellatrix feels Snape will be of no help until he surprises her by making an [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa, swearing on his life that he will protect and assist Draco in his mission.\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] picks Harry up from his aunt and uncle's house, intending to escort him to [[Places in Harry Potter|the Burrow]], the home of Harry's best friend [[Ron Weasley|Ron]] and his large family. On the way, they make a detour to the temporary home of [[Hogwarts staff#Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], former [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|Potions]] teacher at [[Hogwarts]], and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived.\n\nThe next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their [[Hogwarts#Subjects_and_teachers|O.W.L.]] exam results, along with lists of school supplies. Harry's letter reveals that he has been made captain of the Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] team. Later, Harry, [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] follow Draco to [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] artifacts supplier [[Places in Harry Potter#Borgin & Burkes|Borgin and Burke's]] in [[Places in Harry Potter#Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Harry is suspicious of Draco, who he believes has become a [[Death Eater]] following the arrest of his father [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]].\n\nOn the [[Hogwarts Express]], Harry discusses his suspicions of Draco's allegiance to Lord Voldemort, but Ron and Hermione are doubtful because of Harry's lack of evidence. Harry dons his [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]] and hides in the same carriage in which Malfoy is seated. He overhears Draco bragging to his friends about the mission Lord Voldemort has given him. However, Malfoy suspects someone else is in the carriage and discovers Harry was listening to his conversation. Malfoy petrifies Harry and breaks his nose out of rage. Harry cannot get out of the carriage, and he is worried the Hogwarts Express will depart before he can move again. To his relief, [[Nymphadora Tonks]]<!-- Please do not change this to Luna Lovegood. In the book (not the film), it is Tonks who finds Harry. --> finds Harry and escorts him to the castle during the opening feast.\n\nThe students return to school, where [[Dumbledore]] announces Snape will be teaching [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Dumbledore also announces Horace Slughorn will resume his previous post as Potions master. Harry now excels in Potions, thanks to having received a used Potions textbook that once belonged to someone named \"The Half-Blood Prince,\" a mysterious former student who wrote numerous tips and spells in the book that sometimes contradict the written text. Harry uses this information to achieve superb results. During a class contest, The Half-Blood Prince's tips help Harry win a bottle of Felix Felicis, more commonly known as \"Liquid Luck.\" Though Harry's success pleases Slughorn, his newfound brilliance in potions angers Hermione, who feels he is not truly earning his grades and also does not trust the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nBelieving Harry needs to learn Voldemort's past to gain an advantage in a foretold battle, Dumbledore schedules regular meetings with Harry in his office. Dumbledore and Harry use Dumbledore's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]] to look at the memories of those who have had direct contact with Voldemort. Harry learns about [[Lord Voldemort#Family|Voldemort's family]] and his foe's evolution into a murderer obsessed not only with power but with gaining eternal life. Dumbledore shows Harry a memory involving Slughorn conversing with a young Tom Riddle at Hogwarts. The memory has clearly been tampered with. Dumbledore sets Harry the task of convincing Slughorn to give him the true memory so Dumbledore can confirm his suspicions about Voldemort's rise to power and near-invincibility. \n\nMeanwhile, security tightens around the wizarding world now that everyone believes Voldemort has returned. Some people get murdered by Death Eaters. Harry finds several bits of proof that make him even more suspicious of Draco.\n\nA few months later, after receiving an invitation to the funeral for [[Aragog]] the [[Acromantula]], Harry uses an hour's dose of Felix Felicis and succeeds in retrieving Slughorn's unedited memory while at the funeral. Harry presents the memory to Dumbledore, and they watch it together. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle about the process of splitting one's soul and hiding it in several objects called [[Horcruxes]]. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux. Dumbledore tells Harry he suspects Voldemort has created six [[Horcruxes]], making himself virtually immortal by placing a piece of his soul in each one and keeping the seventh within his body. Dumbledore explains that, in order to destroy Voldemort, all the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes, Riddle's diary from [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]] and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather [[Marvolo Gaunt]], have already been destroyed, but four others remain.\n\nAs Harry learns more about his great enemy, the love lives of the main characters become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] that Hermione had previously kissed [[Viktor Krum]], Ron is angered and shuns her. Harry attempts to repair things between the two but fails, resulting in Ron going out with [[Lavender Brown]] and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees the two of them walking out of the boys' dormitory together while Harry was under his father's [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]]. Harry develops deep feelings for Ginny but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] victory, Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship of which Ron reluctantly approves.\n\nNear the end of the year, Harry and Dumbledore journey to a remote cave far from Hogwarts to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Slytherin's locket]]. Dumbledore finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch-black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island at the centre. The locket is at the bottom of a basin on the island and can only be reached if someone drinks the potion concealing it. Harry aids Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, which causes him to experience vivid hallucinations and torturous pain. Though Dumbledore is severely weakened after finishing the potion, the two manage to fight off Voldemort's [[Inferi (Harry Potter)|Inferi]] that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to Hogwarts to find the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] hovering over the school's Astronomy Tower. Harry and Dumbledore ascend to the tower, where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, who is accompanied by Death Eaters he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore subdues Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a freezing spell to keep him hidden. At the same time, Draco disarms Dumbledore and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been Draco's mission from Voldemort all along. Draco is unable to go through with it, and when Snape arrives, he kills Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's funeral, Harry decides to break up with Ginny, saying she would be in danger should their relationship continue. Later, Harry finds out the locket is not the real Horcrux. The fake Horcrux contains a note from someone named \"[[Death Eater#Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]\".

K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]] and the sixth and penultimate novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. Set during [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s sixth year at [[Hogwarts]], the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, [[Lord Voldemort]], and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] and in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold nine million copies in the first 24&nbsp;hours after its release, a record that was eventually broken by its sequel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right to read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 [[British Book of the Year]] award.\n\nReviewers noted that the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes to be love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\nThe [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film adaptation]] of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' was released 15 July 2009 by [[Warner Bros]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not add extensive or in-universe content. It should be understandable to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Harry Potter-->\n\n[[Severus Snape]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], meets with [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s mother, and her sister [[Death Eater#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Lord Voldemort]]'s faithful supporter. Narcissa expresses her concern that her son might not survive a dangerous mission given him by [[Lord Voldemort]]. Bellatrix feels Snape will be of no help until he surprises her by making an [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa, swearing on his life that he will protect and assist Draco in his mission.\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] picks Harry up from his aunt and uncle's house, intending to escort him to [[Places in Harry Potter|the Burrow]], the home of Harry's best friend [[Ron Weasley|Ron]] and his large family. On the way, they make a detour to the temporary home of [[Hogwarts staff#Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], former [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|Potions]] teacher at [[Hogwarts]], and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived.\n\nThe next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their [[Hogwarts#Subjects_and_teachers|O.W.L.]] exam results, along with lists of school supplies. Harry's letter reveals that he has been made captain of the Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] team. Later, Harry, [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] follow Draco to [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] artifacts supplier [[Places in Harry Potter#Borgin & Burkes|Borgin and Burke's]] in [[Places in Harry Potter#Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Harry is suspicious of Draco, who he believes has become a [[Death Eater]] following the arrest of his father [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]].\n\nOn the [[Hogwarts Express]], Harry discusses his suspicions of Draco's allegiance to Lord Voldemort, but Ron and Hermione are doubtful because of Harry's lack of evidence. Harry dons his [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]] and hides in the same carriage in which Malfoy is seated. He overhears Draco bragging to his friends about the mission Lord Voldemort has given him. However, Malfoy suspects someone else is in the carriage and discovers Harry was listening to his conversation. Malfoy petrifies Harry and breaks his nose out of rage. Harry cannot get out of the carriage, and he is worried the Hogwarts Express will depart before he can move again. To his relief, [[Nymphadora Tonks]]<!-- Please do not change this to Luna Lovegood. In the book (not the film), it is Tonks who finds Harry. --> finds Harry and escorts him to the castle during the opening feast.\n\nThe students return to school, where [[Dumbledore]] announces Snape will be teaching [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Dumbledore also announces Horace Slughorn will resume his previous post as Potions master. Harry now excels in Potions, thanks to having received a used Potions textbook that once belonged to someone named \"The Half-Blood Prince,\" a mysterious former student who wrote numerous tips and spells in the book that sometimes contradict the written text. Harry uses this information to achieve superb results. During a class contest, The Half-Blood Prince's tips help Harry win a bottle of Felix Felicis, more commonly known as \"Liquid Luck.\" Though Harry's success pleases Slughorn, his newfound brilliance in potions angers Hermione, who feels he is not truly earning his grades and also does not trust the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nBelieving Harry needs to learn Voldemort's past to gain an advantage in a foretold battle, Dumbledore schedules regular meetings with Harry in his office. Dumbledore and Harry use Dumbledore's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]] to look at the memories of those who have had direct contact with Voldemort. Harry learns about [[Lord Voldemort#Family|Voldemort's family]] and his foe's evolution into a murderer obsessed not only with power but with gaining eternal life. Dumbledore shows Harry a memory involving Slughorn conversing with a young Tom Riddle at Hogwarts. The memory has clearly been tampered with. Dumbledore sets Harry the task of convincing Slughorn to give him the true memory so Dumbledore can confirm his suspicions about Voldemort's rise to power and near-invincibility. \n\nMeanwhile, security tightens around the wizarding world now that everyone believes Voldemort has returned. Some people get murdered by Death Eaters. Harry finds several bits of proof that make him even more suspicious of Draco.\n\nA few months later, after receiving an invitation to the funeral for [[Aragog]] the [[Acromantula]], Harry uses an hour's dose of Felix Felicis and succeeds in retrieving Slughorn's unedited memory while at the funeral. Harry presents the memory to Dumbledore, and they watch it together. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle about the process of splitting one's soul and hiding it in several objects called [[Horcruxes]]. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux. Dumbledore tells Harry he suspects Voldemort has created six [[Horcruxes]], making himself virtually immortal by placing a piece of his soul in each one and keeping the seventh within his body. Dumbledore explains that, in order to destroy Voldemort, all the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes, Riddle's diary from [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]] and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather [[Marvolo Gaunt]], have already been destroyed, but four others remain.\n\nAs Harry learns more about his great enemy, the love lives of the main characters become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] that Hermione had previously kissed [[Viktor Krum]], Ron is angered and shuns her. Harry attempts to repair things between the two but fails, resulting in Ron going out with [[Lavender Brown]] and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees the two of them walking out of the boys' dormitory together while Harry was under his father's [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]]. Harry develops deep feelings for Ginny but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] victory, Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship of which Ron reluctantly approves.\n\nNear the end of the year, Harry and Dumbledore journey to a remote cave far from Hogwarts to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Slytherin's locket]]. Dumbledore finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch-black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island at the centre. The locket is at the bottom of a basin on the island and can only be reached if someone drinks the potion concealing it. Harry aids Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, which causes him to experience vivid hallucinations and torturous pain. Though Dumbledore is severely weakened after finishing the potion, the two manage to fight off Voldemort's [[Inferi (Harry Potter)|Inferi]] that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to Hogwarts to find the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] hovering over the school's Astronomy Tower. Harry and Dumbledore ascend to the tower, where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, who is accompanied by Death Eaters he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore subdues Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a freezing spell to keep him hidden. At the same time, Draco disarms Dumbledore and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been Draco's mission from Voldemort all along. Draco is unable to go through with it, and when Snape arrives, he kills Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's funeral, Harry decides to break up with Ginny, saying she would be in danger should their relationship continue. Later, Harry finds out the locket is not the real Horcrux. The fake Horcrux contains a note from someone named \"[[Death Eater#Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]\". Harry is devastated by Dumbledore's death, and he tells his friends he will not return to Hogwarts. Instead, he says he will spend the next year searching out Voldemort's Horcruxes. Ron and Hermione insist on joining him in destroying Lord Voldemort for good.\n\n==Development==\n===Franchise===\n''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' is the sixth book in the [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter series]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6280000/newsid_6282500/6282542.stm|title=Book 6 \u2013 The Half-Blood Prince|publisher=CBBC Newsround|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=10 July 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227001235/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6280000/newsid_6282500/6282542.stm|archivedate=27 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first book in the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomfolio.com/PublisherInfo/HarryPotter.asp |title=The Phenomenon of Harry Potter |last=Elisco |first=Lester |date=2000\u20132009 |publisher=TomFolio.com |accessdate=22 January 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015849/http://www.tomfolio.com/PublisherInfo/HarryPotter.asp |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a [[National Book Award]] and a gold medal in the 9-&nbsp;to&nbsp;11-year-olds category of the [[Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knapp |first=N.F. |year=2003 |title=In Defense of Harry Potter: An Apologia |journal=School Libraries Worldwide |publisher=International Association of School Librarianship |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=78\u201391 |url=http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309051050/http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.<ref name=\"Harry Potter UK Release Dates\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354 |title=A Potter timeline for muggles |date=14 July 2007 |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=27 September 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001353/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354 |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Harry Potter US&nbsp;\u2014 Scholastic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604101828/http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archivedate=4 June 2007 |title=Harry Potter: Meet J.K.
