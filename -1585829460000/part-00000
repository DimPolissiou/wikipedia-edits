Yamnaya herders likely watched over their cattle and raided on horseback, while driving wagons for the bulk transport of water or food.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=330\u2013335}} Their chiefdoms had institutionalized differences in prestige and power, and the society was organized along patron-client reciprocity, a mutual exchange of gifts and favors between their patrons, the gods, and human clients.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=99}} The Yamnaya funeral sacrifice of wagons, carts, sheep, cattle, and horse was probably related to a cult of ancestors requiring specific rituals and prayers, a connection between language and cult that introduced late Proto-Indo-European to new speakers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=304}} The language itself appeared as a [[Dialect continuum|dialectal continuum]] during this period.{{sfn|Bomhard|2019|p=3}} Proto-Indo-European likely ceased to be spoken after 2500 BC, as its various dialects were already distinct languages that spread across western Eurasia during the third wave of [[Indo-European migrations]],{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=51}} which had begun with the expansion of Usatovo people (associated with pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) towards southeastern Poland through the [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European]] [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture|Tripolye culture]] around 3300 BCE, and with the migration of pre-[[Italo-Celtic]] speakers towards the [[Pannonian Basin]] in Central Europe around 3100\u20132800 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}{{sfn|Bomhard|2019|p=3}}\n\n== Social structure ==\n\n=== Class structure ===\nIt is generally agreed that Proto-Indo-European society was hierarchical, with some form of social ranking and various degrees of social status.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17\u201319}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=284\u2013285}} It is unlikely however that they had a rigidly stratified structure, or [[Caste system in India|castes]] such as are found in historical India.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=430}} Some [[kurgan]] graves, larger than the average and necessitating a considerable number of people to be built, suggest a higher status given to some individuals, although this prestigious funeral was not necessarily reserved to the wealthiest person. Smiths in particular were given sumptuous graves, possibly due to the association of smithery to magic during the [[Bronze Age|early Bronze Age]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}} In general, such graves were mostly occupied by males in the eastern Don-Volga steppes, while they were more egalitarian in the western Dnieper-Donets region.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=331\u2013334}} There was a general distinction between free persons and slaves, typically prisoners of war or debtors unable to repay a debt.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17}} The free part of society was composed of an elite class of priests, kings and warriors, along with the commoners,{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17}} with each tribe following a chief (''*wi\u1e31pots'') sponsoring feasts and ceremonies and who was eventually immortalized in praise poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=336}}[[File:Yamna03.jpg|thumb|215.994x215.994px|Yamnaya bone and canine ornaments.]]\n=== Kinship ===\nLinguistics has allowed for the reliable reconstruction of a large number of words relating to kinship relations. These all agree in exhibiting a [[patriarchal]], [[patrilocal]] and [[patrilineal]] social fabric.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=17\u201319}} Patrilocality is confirmed by lexical evidence, including the word *''{{PIE|h<sub>2</sub>u\u032fedh}}''-, \"to lead (away)\", being the word that denotes a male wedding a female, but not vice-versa.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=483}} Rights, possessions, and responsibilities were consequently reckoned to the father, and wives were to reside after marriage near the husband's family, after the payment of a bride-price.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=328}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\nThe *''dems-potis'' was the patriarch, the master of the household ({{PIE|''*domos''}}).{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Once established, the family lasted as long as the male stock of its founder endured, and clan or tribal founders were often portrayed as mythical beings stemming from a mythical past in Indo-European traditions.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} In this form of kinship organization, the individual's genetic distance from the clan's founding ancestor determined his social status. But if he was able of exceptional prowess or virtue, the same individual could in his turn gain social prestige among the community and eventually found his own descent-group.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} \n\nIn the reconstructed lexicon linking the individual to the clan, ''*h\u2084er\u00f3s'' meant a \"member of one\u2019s own group\", \"one who belongs to the community in contrast to an outsider\", which would give the Indo-Iranian term ''[[Aryan|\u00e1rya]]'' (an [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]) and the Irish ''aire'' (\"noble, chief\").{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=209}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} It is unlikely however that the word had an ethnic connotation, and we do not known if Proto-Indo-European speakers had a term to designate themselves as a group.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Another term, *''h\u2081leudhos'', meant \"people\", \"freemen\" in a more general way.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\n=== Patron-client ===\nProto-Indo-European had several words for \"leader\": *''tag\u00f3s'' was a general term derived from ''*t\u0101\u0306g-'' (\"set in place, arrange\"); *''h\u2083r\u1e17\u01f5s'' meant a ruler who also had religious functions, with the Roman [[Rex Sacrorum|rex sacrorum]] (\"king of the sacred\") as an heritage of the priestly function of the king; *''w(n\u0329)n\u00e1kts'' designated a \"lord\" and possessed a feminine equivalent,''*wn\u00e1ktih\u2090'' (a \"queen\"); while the ''*wi\u1e31pots'' (or ''*wi\u1e31-potis'') was the chief of the settlement ({{PIE|''*wei\u1e31s''}}),{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} the seat of a tribe, clan or family.{{sfn|Beekes|2011|p=35}}\n\nPublic feasts sponsored by such patrons were a way for them to promote and secure a political hierarchy built on the unequal mobilization of labor and resources, by displaying their generosity towards the rest of the community. Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *''ghosti''-''potis'', the \"lord of the guests\", who honored the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}\n\n=== Guest-host ===\nVertical power differences were partly balanced by horizontal mutual obligations of hospitality between guest and hosts.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}} According to [[David W. Anthony]], the domestication of horses and the introduction of the wagon in the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] between 4500 and 3500 BC led to an increase in mobility across the Yamnaya horizon, and eventually to the emergence of a guest-host political structure. As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially in harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*''h\u2084er\u00f3s'') until then.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} In Proto-Indo-European, the term *''gh\u00f3s-ti''-, whose original meaning must have been \"table companion\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garnier|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Garnier|date=2013|title=Le nom indo-europ\u00e9en de l'h\u00f4te|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=133|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|via=}}</ref> could either mean a ''host'' or a ''guest.''{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant [[Cognate|cognates]]: Latin ''hosp\u0113s'' (\"foreigner, guest; host\"), Old English ''\u0121iest'' (\"stranger, guest\"), or [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''gost\u012d'' (\"guest\") and ''gospod\u012d'' (\"master\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=269}}\n\nGuests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: [[Homer]]\u2019s warriors, [[Glaucus_of_Lycia|Glaukos]] and [[Diomedes]], stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their ''grandfathers'' had shared a guest-host relationship.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}} Violations of the guest-host obligations were immoral, illegal and unholy: in [[Early Irish law|Irish law]], refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder. The killing of a guest was also greeted with a singular revulsion, as was the abuse of hospitality.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\nBecause of the archaic nature of traditional legal phraseology\u2014which preserves old forms and meaning for words\u2014and the necessity for legal sentences to be uttered precisely the same way each time to remain binding, it is possible to securely reconstruct some elements of the Proto-Indo-European legal system.{{Sfn|Watkins|1986|p=}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} For instance, the word *''serk''- (\"to make a circle, complete\") designated a type of compensation where the father (or the master) had to either pay for the damages caused by his son (or slave), or surrender the perpetrator to the offended party. It is attested by a common legal and linguistic origin in both [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Hittite laws]].{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}}\n\nLaw was apparently designed to preserve the \"order\" (''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'') of the universe, with the underlying concept that harmony should be maintained, be it in the physical universe or the social world.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|p=345|1997}} There was however no public enforcement of justice in Proto-Indo-European society, nor was there formal courts as we know it today. Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that featured witnesses.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} The word for \"oath\", ''*h\u2081\u00f3itos'', derives from the verb ''*h\u2081ei-'' (\"to go\"), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=277}}\n\nThe root ''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'' (from ''*h\u2090er-'', \"to fit\") is associated with the concept of a [[Cosmos|cosmic order]], i.e. which is \"fitting, right, ordered\". It is one of most securely reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words, with cognates in most sub-families: [[Latin]] ''artus'' (\"joint\"); [[Middle High German]] ''art'' (\"innate feature, nature, fashion\"); [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''art\u00fas'' (\"arrangement\"), possibly ''[[arete]]'' (\"excellence\");<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beekes|first=Robert S.

But if he was able of exceptional prowess or virtue, the same individual could in his turn gain social prestige among the community and eventually found his own descent-group.{{Sfn|Della Volpe|1993|p=}} \n\nIn the reconstructed lexicon linking the individual to the clan, ''*h\u2084er\u00f3s'' meant a \"member of one\u2019s own group\", \"one who belongs to the community in contrast to an outsider\", which would give the Indo-Iranian term ''[[Aryan|\u00e1rya]]'' (an [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]) and the Irish ''aire'' (\"noble, chief\").{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=209}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} It is unlikely however that the word had an ethnic connotation, and we do not known if Proto-Indo-European speakers had a term to designate themselves as a group.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} Another term, *''h\u2081leudhos'', meant \"people\", \"freemen\" in a more general way.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}}\n\n=== Patron-client ===\nProto-Indo-European had several words for \"leader\": *''tag\u00f3s'' was a general term derived from ''*t\u0101\u0306g-'' (\"set in place, arrange\"); *''h\u2083r\u1e17\u01f5s'' meant a ruler who also had religious functions, with the Roman [[Rex Sacrorum|rex sacrorum]] (\"king of the sacred\") as an heritage of the priestly function of the king; *''w(n\u0329)n\u00e1kts'' designated a \"lord\" and possessed a feminine equivalent,''*wn\u00e1ktih\u2090'' (a \"queen\"); while the ''*wi\u1e31pots'' (or ''*wi\u1e31-potis'') was the chief of the settlement ({{PIE|''*wei\u1e31s''}}),{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=266\u2013269}} the seat of a tribe, clan or family.{{sfn|Beekes|2011|p=35}}\n\nPublic feasts sponsored by such patrons were a way for them to promote and secure a political hierarchy built on the unequal mobilization of labor and resources, by displaying their generosity towards the rest of the community. Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *''ghosti''-''potis'', the \"lord of the guests\", who honored the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}}\n\n=== Guest-host ===\nVertical power differences were partly balanced by horizontal mutual obligations of hospitality between guest and hosts.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|pp=}} According to [[David W.

As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially in harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*''h\u2084er\u00f3s'') until then.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} In Proto-Indo-European, the term *''gh\u00f3s-ti''-, whose original meaning must have been \"table companion\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garnier|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Garnier|date=2013|title=Le nom indo-europ\u00e9en de l'h\u00f4te|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=133|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|via=}}</ref> could either mean a ''host'' or a ''guest.''{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant [[Cognate|cognates]]: Latin ''hosp\u0113s'' (\"foreigner, guest; host\"), Old English ''\u0121iest'' (\"stranger, guest\"), or [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''gost\u012d'' (\"guest\") and ''gospod\u012d'' (\"master\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=269}}\n\nGuests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: [[Homer]]\u2019s warriors, [[Glaucus_of_Lycia|Glaukos]] and [[Diomedes]], stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their ''grandfathers'' had shared a guest-host relationship.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}} Violations of the guest-host obligations were immoral, illegal and unholy: in [[Early Irish law|Irish law]], refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder. The killing of a guest was also greeted with a singular revulsion, as was the abuse of hospitality.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\nBecause of the archaic nature of traditional legal phraseology\u2014which preserves old forms and meaning for words\u2014and the necessity for legal sentences to be uttered precisely the same way each time to remain binding, it is possible to securely reconstruct some elements of the Proto-Indo-European legal system.{{Sfn|Watkins|1986|p=}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} For instance, the word *''serk''- (\"to make a circle, complete\") designated a type of compensation where the father (or the master) had to either pay for the damages caused by his son (or slave), or surrender the perpetrator to the offended party. It is attested by a common legal and linguistic origin in both [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Hittite laws]].{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}}\n\nLaw was apparently designed to preserve the \"order\" (''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'') of the universe, with the underlying concept that harmony should be maintained, be it in the physical universe or the social world.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|p=345|1997}} There was however no public enforcement of justice in Proto-Indo-European society, nor was there formal courts as we know it today. Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that featured witnesses.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} The word for \"oath\", ''*h\u2081\u00f3itos'', derives from the verb ''*h\u2081ei-'' (\"to go\"), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=277}}\n\nThe root ''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'' (from ''*h\u2090er-'', \"to fit\") is associated with the concept of a [[Cosmos|cosmic order]], i.e. which is \"fitting, right, ordered\".

Many churches joined the URCNA after splitting from the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] denomination.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe URCNA has grown from the earlier [[Protestant]] movements in Europe of the 16th and 17th century, and also from Reformed churches in Belgium and the Netherlands. The URCNA subscribes to three confessions of faith: the [[Canons of Dordt]], written in 1618 and 1619 by an international group of Reformed churches, the [[Belgic Confession]], written by [[Guido de Bres]] in the mid-1500s, and the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], written by various scholars in the city of [[Heidelberg, Germany]]. Collectively, these statements of faith are called the \"[[Three Forms of Unity]].\" In addition to these forms, the URCNA holds to the three ecumenical creeds: the [[Apostles Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]], and the [[Athanasian Creed]].<ref>[http://www.urcna.org/What%20We%20Believe www.urcna.org/What We Believe]</ref> One of the distinct fundamental doctrines the URNCA describes is forensic justification, according to which Christ offers a double benefit: one's sin is imputed to Christ and he suffers for it on the cross, while His [[Active obedience of Christ|perfect obedience]] is [[Imputed righteousness|credited to believers]] who receive its benefits, including eternal life.\n\n== History ==\nThe URCNA was founded as a federation of [[Reformed churches]] in 1996 at [[Lynwood, Illinois]] CRC.  Most of the members that founded the URCNA left the [[CRCNA]], due to disagreement on several issues like [[Ordination of women in Protestant churches|women's ordination]], evolution cases, and [[biblical inerrancy]]. Conservative reformed believers were also concerned that the Christian Reformed Churches were departing from Scriptural teaching to accommodate modern social trends. Some 36 churches with 7,600 members joined the federative unity, held their first Synod, and adopted the name United Reformed Churches in North America.\n\n== Statistics ==\nURCNA churches can be found in 22 US states, mostly in the Upper Midwest ([[Iowa]] and [[Michigan]]) and [[California]], and in six [[Canadian Provinces]] mostly in [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]]. As of 2008, the churches have grown, mostly through additional members leaving the CRCNA in the late 1990s, to approximately 105 congregations spread across the United States and Canada, with 22,495 members, 146 ministers, and 9 [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|Classes]] (Michigan, Central US, Eastern US, Southwest US, Pacific Northwest, Southern Ontario, Ontario East, Southwestern Ontario, Western Canada).<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Konynenbelt|publisher=United Reformed Churches in North America|url=http://www.service-life.com/urcna/churchdirectory/2008/2008%20Directory%20Part%20I%20Only%20-%2010-31-08.pdf|title=Directory of the United Reformed Churches in North America|format=PDF|page=3|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>https://www.service-life.com/sysfiles/member/family/urcna_report.cfm?memberid=303&public=1</ref>\n\n== Congregations ==\nThe URCNA has congregations in 22 US states, mostly focused in the US.

Many churches joined the URCNA after splitting from the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] denomination.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe URCNA has grown from the earlier [[Protestant]] movements in Europe of the 16th and 17th century, and also from Reformed churches in Belgium and the Netherlands. The URCNA subscribes to three confessions of faith: the [[Canons of Dordt]], written in 1618 and 1619 by an international group of Reformed churches, the [[Belgic Confession]], written by [[Guido de Bres]] in the mid-1500s, and the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], written by various scholars in the city of [[Heidelberg, Germany]]. Collectively, these statements of faith are called the \"[[Three Forms of Unity]].\" In addition to these forms, the URCNA holds to the three ecumenical creeds: the [[Apostles Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]], and the [[Athanasian Creed]].<ref>[http://www.urcna.org/What%20We%20Believe www.urcna.org/What We Believe]</ref> One of the distinct fundamental doctrines the URNCA describes is forensic justification, according to which Christ offers a double benefit: one's sin is imputed to Christ and he suffers for it on the cross, while His [[Active obedience of Christ|perfect obedience]] is [[Imputed righteousness|credited to believers]] who receive its benefits, including eternal life.\n\n== History ==\nThe URCNA was founded as a federation of [[Reformed churches]] in 1996 at [[Lynwood, Illinois]] CRC.  Most of the members that founded the URCNA left the [[CRCNA]], due to disagreement on several issues like [[Ordination of women in Protestant churches|women's ordination]], evolution cases, and [[biblical inerrancy]]. Conservative reformed believers were also concerned that the Christian Reformed Churches were departing from Scriptural teaching to accommodate modern social trends. Some 36 churches with 7,600 members joined the federative unity, held their first Synod, and adopted the name United Reformed Churches in North America.\n\n== Statistics ==\nURCNA churches can be found in 22 US states, mostly in the Upper Midwest ([[Iowa]] and [[Michigan]]) and [[California]], and in six [[Canadian Provinces]] mostly in [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]]. As of 2008, the churches have grown, mostly through additional members leaving the CRCNA in the late 1990s, to approximately 105 congregations spread across the United States and Canada, with 22,495 members, 146 ministers, and 9 [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|Classes]] (Michigan, Central US, Eastern US, Southwest US, Pacific Northwest, Southern Ontario, Ontario East, Southwestern Ontario, Western Canada).<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Konynenbelt|publisher=United Reformed Churches in North America|url=http://www.service-life.com/urcna/churchdirectory/2008/2008%20Directory%20Part%20I%20Only%20-%2010-31-08.pdf|title=Directory of the United Reformed Churches in North America|format=PDF|page=3|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>https://www.service-life.com/sysfiles/member/family/urcna_report.cfm?memberid=303&public=1</ref>\n\n== Congregations ==\nThe URCNA has congregations in 22 US states, mostly focused in the US.

{"title_page": "Creative writing", "text_new": "{{short description|Academic discipline concerned with creating literature}}\n'''Creative writing''' is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal [[professional writing|professional]], [[journalistic]], [[Academic writing|academic]], or [[technical writing|technical]] forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] or with various traditions of [[poetry]] and [[poetics]]. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as [[feature story|feature stories]] to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both [[fiction]]al and [[non-fiction]]al works fall into this category, including such forms as [[novel]]s, [[biography|biographies]], [[short stories]], and [[poem]]s. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and [[poetry]] classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as [[crime fiction|crime]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]]. Writing for the screen and stage&mdash;[[screenwriting]] and [[Playwright|playwriting]]&mdash;are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.\n\nCreative writing can technically be considered any writing of [[Originality|original]] [[Composition (language)|composition]]. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called [[literature]], including the variety of its [[Literary genre|genre]]s. In her work, ''Foundations of Creativity'', Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant's ''Teaching the People's Language'' to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:\n\n{{cquote|Witty and LaBrant\u2026[say creative writing] is a composition of any type of writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as\n#the need for keeping records of significant experience,\n#the need for sharing experience with an interested group, and\n#the need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.<ref name=\"Marksberry\">Marksberry, Mary Lee. ''Foundation of Creativity.'' Harper's Series on Teaching. (New York ; London: Harper & Row, 1963), 39.</ref>}}ABRAR KHAN\n\n== In academia==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2010|talk=y}}\nUnlike its academic counterpart of writing classes that teach students to compose work based on the rules of the [[language]], creative writing is believed to focus on students\u2019 self-expression.<ref>Johnson, Burges and [[Syracuse University]]. \"Creative Writing\", 3.</ref> While creative writing as an educational subject is often available at some stages, if not throughout, [[K\u201312 education]], perhaps the most refined form of creative writing as an educational focus is in [[university|universities]]. Following a reworking of university education in the [[post-war]] era, creative writing has progressively gained prominence in the university setting. In the UK, the first formal creative writing program was established as a [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts degree]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1970 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|title=Creative Writing - UEA|website=www.uea.ac.uk|access-date=2014-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522210914/http://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|archive-date=2014-05-22|url-status=live}}</ref> by the novelists [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Angus Wilson]]. With the beginning of formal creative writing programs:\n{{cquote|For the first time in the sad and enchanting history of literature, for the first time in the glorious and dreadful history of the world, the writer was welcome in the academic place.

Traditionally these programs are associated with the English departments in the respective schools, but this notion has been challenged in recent time as more creative writing programs have spun off into their own department. Most Creative Writing degrees for undergraduates in college are [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degrees (BFA).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some continue to pursue a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Creative Writing, the terminal degree in the field. At one time rare, [[PhD.]] programs are becoming more prevalent in the field, as more writers attempt to bridge the gap between academic study and artistic pursuit.\n\nCreative writers typically decide an emphasis in either fiction or poetry, and they usually start with short stories or simple poems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} They then make a schedule based on this emphasis including literature classes, education classes and workshop classes to strengthen their skills and techniques. Though they have their own programs of study in the fields of [[film]] and [[theatre]], [[screenwriting]] and playwriting have become more popular in creative writing programs, as creative writing programs attempt to work more closely with film and theatre programs as well as English programs. Creative writing students are encouraged to get involved in extracurricular writing-based activities, such as publishing clubs, school-based literary magazines or newspapers, writing contests, writing colonies or conventions, and extended education classes.\n\n== In the classroom ==\nCreative writing is usually taught in a [[workshop]] format rather than [[seminar]] style. In workshops students usually submit original work for peer critique. Students also format a writing method through the process of writing and re-writing. Some courses teach the means to exploit or access latent creativity or more technical issues such as [[editing]], [[Narrative structure|structural]] [[literary technique|techniques]], [[genre]]s, random [[plot generator|idea generating]] or unblocking [[writer's block]] . Some noted [[author]]s, such as [[Michael Chabon]], [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], [[Kevin Brockmeier]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Karl Kirchwey]],<ref name=twsOctBeqqq>{{cite news\n |author       = John Swansburg\n |title        = At Yale, Lessons in Writing and in Life\n |newspaper    = The New York Times\n |quote        = Karl Kirchwey, who graduated from Yale in 1979, recently became the director of creative writing at Bryn Mawr College, after having run the Unterberg Poetry Center at the 92nd Street Y for over a decade.\n |date         = April 29, 2001\n |url          = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/nyregion/at-yale-lessons-in-writing-and-in-life.html\n |accessdate   = 2010-10-15\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110331104719/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/nyregion/at-yale-lessons-in-writing-and-in-life.html\n |archive-date = 2011-03-31\n |url-status     = live\n }}</ref> [[Rose Tremain]] and reputed screenwriters, such as [[David Benioff]], [[Darren Star]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], have graduated from university creative writing programs.\n\n===Controversy in academia===\nCreative writing is considered by some academics (mostly in the USA) to be an extension of the [[English studies|English]] discipline, even though it is taught around the world in many languages. The English discipline is traditionally seen as the critical study of literary forms, not the creation of literary forms. Some academics see creative writing as a challenge to this tradition. In the UK and Australia, as well as increasingly in the US and the rest of the world, creative writing is considered a discipline in its own right, not an offshoot of any other discipline.\n{{cquote|To say that the creative has no part in education is to argue that a university is not universal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Engle |first=Paul |chapter=The Writer and the Place |title=A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop |editor-first=Robert |editor-last=Dana |location=Iowa City |publisher=University of Iowa Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-87745-668-2 |page=3 }}</ref>}}\nThose who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from the English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing experience. They argue that creative writing hones the students\u2019 abilities to clearly express their thoughts and that creative writing entails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be applied to the writer's work to foster improvement. These critical analysis skills are further used in other literary studies outside the creative writing sphere. Indeed, the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-out and original piece, is considered by some to constitute experience in creative [[problem-solving]].\n\nDespite a large number of academic creative writing programs throughout the world, many people argue that creative writing cannot be taught. Essayist [[Louis Menand]] explores the issue in an article for the ''New Yorker'' in which he quotes [[Kay Boyle]], the director of the creative writing program at San Francisco State University for sixteen years, who said, \u201call creative-writing programs ought to be abolished by law.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |title=Show or Tell - Should Creative Writing be Taught? |first=Louis |last=Menand |work=The New Yorker |date=June 8, 2009 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/08/show-or-tell |archivedate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830182154/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand }}</ref> Contemporary discussions of creative writing at the university level vary widely; some people value MFA programs and regard them with great respect, whereas many MFA candidates and hopefuls lament their chosen programs' lack of both diversity and genre awareness.\n\n==Elements==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Action (fiction)|Action]]\n*[[Character (arts)|Character]]\n*[[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]\n*[[Dialogue (fiction)|Dialogue]]\n*[[Literary genre|Genre]]\n*[[Narration]]\n*[[Pace (narrative)|Pace]]\n*[[Plot (narrative)|Plot]]\n*[[Narrative mode#Narrative point of view|Point of View]]\n*[[Scene (drama)|Scene]]\n*[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]\n*[[Writing style|Style]]\n*[[Suspense]]\n*[[Theme (narrative)|Theme]] and [[Motif (narrative)|Motif]]\n*[[Tone (literature)|Tone]]\n*[[Writer's voice|Voice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Forms and genres of literature==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Autobiography]]/[[Memoir]]\n* [[Creative non-fiction]] (Personal & Journalistic Essays)\n* [[Children's books]]\n* [[Drama]]\n* [[Epic poetry|Epic]]\n* [[Flash fiction]]\n* [[Graphic novels]]/[[Comics]]\n* [[Novel]]\n* [[Novella]]\n* [[Play (theater)|Play]]\n* [[Poetry]]\n* [[Screenplay]] \n* [[Short story]]\n* [[Dialogues]]\n* [[Blogs]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Asemic writing]]\n* [[Author]]\n* [[Book report]]\n* [[Clarion Workshop]]\n* [[Collaborative writing]]\n* [[Creativity]]\n* [[Electronic literature]]\n* [[Expository writing]]\n* [[Fan fiction]]\n* [[Fiction writing]]\n* [[High School for Writing and Communication Arts]] (in New York City)\n* [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]\n* [[Literature]]\n* [[Show, don't tell]]\n* [[Songwriting]]\n* [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)]]\n* [[Writer's block]]\n* [[Writing]]\n* [[Writing circle]]\n* [[Writing process]]\n* [[Writing style]]\n* [[Writing Workshop]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Brewer |editor-first=R.

Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as [[feature story|feature stories]] to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both [[fiction]]al and [[non-fiction]]al works fall into this category, including such forms as [[novel]]s, [[biography|biographies]], [[short stories]], and [[poem]]s. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and [[poetry]] classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as [[crime fiction|crime]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]]. Writing for the screen and stage&mdash;[[screenwriting]] and [[Playwright|playwriting]]&mdash;are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.\n\nCreative writing can technically be considered any writing of [[Originality|original]] [[Composition (language)|composition]]. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called [[literature]], including the variety of its [[Literary genre|genre]]s. In her work, ''Foundations of Creativity'', Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant's ''Teaching the People's Language'' to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:\n\n{{cquote|Witty and LaBrant\u2026[say creative writing] is a composition of any type of writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as\n#the need for keeping records of significant experience,\n#the need for sharing experience with an interested group, and\n#the need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.<ref name=\"Marksberry\">Marksberry, Mary Lee. ''Foundation of Creativity.'' Harper's Series on Teaching. (New York ; London: Harper & Row, 1963), 39.</ref>}}\n\n== In academia==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2010|talk=y}}\nUnlike its academic counterpart of writing classes that teach students to compose work based on the rules of the [[language]], creative writing is believed to focus on students\u2019 self-expression.<ref>Johnson, Burges and [[Syracuse University]]. \"Creative Writing\", 3.</ref> While creative writing as an educational subject is often available at some stages, if not throughout, [[K\u201312 education]], perhaps the most refined form of creative writing as an educational focus is in [[university|universities]]. Following a reworking of university education in the [[post-war]] era, creative writing has progressively gained prominence in the university setting. In the UK, the first formal creative writing program was established as a [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts degree]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1970 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|title=Creative Writing - UEA|website=www.uea.ac.uk|access-date=2014-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522210914/http://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|archive-date=2014-05-22|url-status=live}}</ref> by the novelists [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Angus Wilson]]. With the beginning of formal creative writing programs:\n{{cquote|For the first time in the sad and enchanting history of literature, for the first time in the glorious and dreadful history of the world, the writer was welcome in the academic place. If the mind could be honored there, why not the imagination?<ref name=\"Engle\">{{cite book |last=Engle |first=Paul |chapter=The Writer and the Place |title=A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop |editor-first=Robert |editor-last=Dana |location=Iowa City |publisher=University of Iowa Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-87745-668-2 |page=2 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Programs of study===\nCreative Writing programs are typically available to writers from the high school level all the way through graduate school/university and adult education. Traditionally these programs are associated with the English departments in the respective schools, but this notion has been challenged in recent time as more creative writing programs have spun off into their own department. Most Creative Writing degrees for undergraduates in college are [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degrees (BFA).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some continue to pursue a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Creative Writing, the terminal degree in the field. At one time rare, [[PhD.]] programs are becoming more prevalent in the field, as more writers attempt to bridge the gap between academic study and artistic pursuit.\n\nCreative writers typically decide an emphasis in either fiction or poetry, and they usually start with short stories or simple poems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} They then make a schedule based on this emphasis including literature classes, education classes and workshop classes to strengthen their skills and techniques. Though they have their own programs of study in the fields of [[film]] and [[theatre]], [[screenwriting]] and playwriting have become more popular in creative writing programs, as creative writing programs attempt to work more closely with film and theatre programs as well as English programs. Creative writing students are encouraged to get involved in extracurricular writing-based activities, such as publishing clubs, school-based literary magazines or newspapers, writing contests, writing colonies or conventions, and extended education classes.\n\n== In the classroom ==\nCreative writing is usually taught in a [[workshop]] format rather than [[seminar]] style. In workshops students usually submit original work for peer critique. Students also format a writing method through the process of writing and re-writing. Some courses teach the means to exploit or access latent creativity or more technical issues such as [[editing]], [[Narrative structure|structural]] [[literary technique|techniques]], [[genre]]s, random [[plot generator|idea generating]] or unblocking [[writer's block]] . Some noted [[author]]s, such as [[Michael Chabon]], [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], [[Kevin Brockmeier]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Karl Kirchwey]],<ref name=twsOctBeqqq>{{cite news\n |author       = John Swansburg\n |title        = At Yale, Lessons in Writing and in Life\n |newspaper    = The New York Times\n |quote        = Karl Kirchwey, who graduated from Yale in 1979, recently became the director of creative writing at Bryn Mawr College, after having run the Unterberg Poetry Center at the 92nd Street Y for over a decade.\n |date         = April 29, 2001\n |url          = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/nyregion/at-yale-lessons-in-writing-and-in-life.html\n |accessdate   = 2010-10-15\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110331104719/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/nyregion/at-yale-lessons-in-writing-and-in-life.html\n |archive-date = 2011-03-31\n |url-status     = live\n }}</ref> [[Rose Tremain]] and reputed screenwriters, such as [[David Benioff]], [[Darren Star]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], have graduated from university creative writing programs.\n\n===Controversy in academia===\nCreative writing is considered by some academics (mostly in the USA) to be an extension of the [[English studies|English]] discipline, even though it is taught around the world in many languages. The English discipline is traditionally seen as the critical study of literary forms, not the creation of literary forms. Some academics see creative writing as a challenge to this tradition. In the UK and Australia, as well as increasingly in the US and the rest of the world, creative writing is considered a discipline in its own right, not an offshoot of any other discipline.\n{{cquote|To say that the creative has no part in education is to argue that a university is not universal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Engle |first=Paul |chapter=The Writer and the Place |title=A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop |editor-first=Robert |editor-last=Dana |location=Iowa City |publisher=University of Iowa Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-87745-668-2 |page=3 }}</ref>}}\nThose who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from the English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing experience. They argue that creative writing hones the students\u2019 abilities to clearly express their thoughts and that creative writing entails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be applied to the writer's work to foster improvement. These critical analysis skills are further used in other literary studies outside the creative writing sphere. Indeed, the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-out and original piece, is considered by some to constitute experience in creative [[problem-solving]].\n\nDespite a large number of academic creative writing programs throughout the world, many people argue that creative writing cannot be taught. Essayist [[Louis Menand]] explores the issue in an article for the ''New Yorker'' in which he quotes [[Kay Boyle]], the director of the creative writing program at San Francisco State University for sixteen years, who said, \u201call creative-writing programs ought to be abolished by law.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |title=Show or Tell - Should Creative Writing be Taught? |first=Louis |last=Menand |work=The New Yorker |date=June 8, 2009 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/08/show-or-tell |archivedate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830182154/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand }}</ref> Contemporary discussions of creative writing at the university level vary widely; some people value MFA programs and regard them with great respect, whereas many MFA candidates and hopefuls lament their chosen programs' lack of both diversity and genre awareness.\n\n==Elements==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Action (fiction)|Action]]\n*[[Character (arts)|Character]]\n*[[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]\n*[[Dialogue (fiction)|Dialogue]]\n*[[Literary genre|Genre]]\n*[[Narration]]\n*[[Pace (narrative)|Pace]]\n*[[Plot (narrative)|Plot]]\n*[[Narrative mode#Narrative point of view|Point of View]]\n*[[Scene (drama)|Scene]]\n*[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]\n*[[Writing style|Style]]\n*[[Suspense]]\n*[[Theme (narrative)|Theme]] and [[Motif (narrative)|Motif]]\n*[[Tone (literature)|Tone]]\n*[[Writer's voice|Voice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Forms and genres of literature==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Autobiography]]/[[Memoir]]\n* [[Creative non-fiction]] (Personal & Journalistic Essays)\n* [[Children's books]]\n* [[Drama]]\n* [[Epic poetry|Epic]]\n* [[Flash fiction]]\n* [[Graphic novels]]/[[Comics]]\n* [[Novel]]\n* [[Novella]]\n* [[Play (theater)|Play]]\n* [[Poetry]]\n* [[Screenplay]] \n* [[Short story]]\n* [[Dialogues]]\n* [[Blogs]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Asemic writing]]\n* [[Author]]\n* [[Book report]]\n* [[Clarion Workshop]]\n* [[Collaborative writing]]\n* [[Creativity]]\n* [[Electronic literature]]\n* [[Expository writing]]\n* [[Fan fiction]]\n* [[Fiction writing]]\n* [[High School for Writing and Communication Arts]] (in New York City)\n* [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]\n* [[Literature]]\n* [[Show, don't tell]]\n* [[Songwriting]]\n* [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)]]\n* [[Writer's block]]\n* [[Writing]]\n* [[Writing circle]]\n* [[Writing process]]\n* [[Writing style]]\n* [[Writing Workshop]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Brewer |editor-first=R.

The NFL had planned to add two teams in {{nfly|1967}}; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in {{nfly|1966}}. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to {{nfly|1960}}: 12 games over 13 weeks). The second expansion team, the [[1967 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its 16th franchise.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when Rozelle granted ownership to 40-year-old [[Rankin Smith Sr.]], an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia. He paid $8.5 million, the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.<ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\"/> Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta.

Under head coach [[Norb Hecker]], Atlanta lost their first nine regular season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling [[1966 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 20 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at [[1966 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], and beat [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis]] in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.  The team finished the 1960s with 12 wins in four seasons.\n\nThe Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta during the [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|1970]] season, a 20\u20137 loss to the [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. The only two winning seasons in their first 12 years were {{nowrap|[[1971 Atlanta Falcons season|1971]] (7\u20136\u20131)}} and {{nowrap|[[1973 Atlanta Falcons season|1973]] (9\u20135).}}\n\n===1978\u20131989===\n[[File:1987 Atlanta Falcons Pocket Schedule.jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons' defense taking on [[1985 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[John Elway]] during a [[1985 Atlanta Falcons season|1985]] game.]]\nIn the [[1978 Atlanta Falcons season|1978]] season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] 14\u201313.

The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30\u201327 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened [[1982 Atlanta Falcons season|1982]] season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 30\u201324. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss. The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years.\n\n===1989\u20131996===\nIn the [[1989 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.\n\n[[File:Atlanta Falcons at Los Angeles Rams 1991-12-08 - 01 (Atlanta Falcons crop).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons playing against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during a 1991 away game.]]\n\nAfter defeating the [[1991 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|1991]] season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. In the [[1991 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nIn [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|1992]], the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.\n\n===1997\u20132000: The Dan Reeves era===\nIn 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201310, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14\u20132 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] 30\u201327, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34\u201319 to the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].\n\nIn the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back [[Jamal Anderson]], who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5\u201311 regular season record.<ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\"/> In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4\u201312 and once again missing the playoffs.\n\n===2001\u20132006===\nIn the [[2001 NFL draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]).\n\nThe Falcons finished the [[2001 Atlanta Falcons season|2001 season]] with a record of 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. [[Jessie Tuggle]] retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, [[Arthur M. Blank]] reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2001/12/17/weekinbiz.html | title=Arthur Blank buys Falcons from Smith family | date=December 17, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular season record of 9\u20136\u20131, tying the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever. A 20\u20136 loss to the [[Donovan McNabb]]-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.\n\nOn March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.<ref name=\"NewFalconsLogo2003\">{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new logo|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=171010|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=March 19, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030623173517/http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=171010 |archivedate=June 23, 2003|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\" /> During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first 12 games of the season.

Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5\u201311 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, [[Jim L. Mora]], was hired and Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]]. The Falcons went 11\u20135, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], 47\u201317, in the [[Georgia Dome]], advancing to the [[NFC Championship Game]], which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], 27\u201310.\n\nThe [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8\u20138. In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7\u20139, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and [[Bobby Petrino]], the [[University of Louisville]]'s football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.\n\n===2007===\n{{main|2007 Atlanta Falcons season}}\nFor the 2007 season, the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] were forced to start [[Joey Harrington]] at quarterback.

In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (white and gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team has worn black facemasks since then.\n\nA prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]], but was never worn.\n\nIn [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]]. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)\n\nBoth the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]]. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter ''F''.<ref name=\"NewFalconsLogo2003\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Uniform History|url=https://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/pdf/media-guides/ATL-Media-Guide.pdf#page=377|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2019 Atlanta Falcons Media Guide|date=August 13, 2019|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new uniforms at fan rally|url=http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=April 24, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705011150/http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|archive-date=July 5, 2003|access-date=August 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], winning the first two contests (24\u201321 in {{nfly|2004}} and 36\u201317 in {{nfly|2005}}), but losing 31\u201313 in {{nfly|2006}}. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34\u201314. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14\u20133. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 \u2013 against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team.\n\nThe Falcons unveiled an all-red [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL AND NIKE REVEAL COLOR RUSH UNIFORMS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/nfl-and-nike-reveal-color-rush-uniforms-17676181|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tabeek|first=Matthew|title=LOOK: THREE STRAIGHT HOME GAMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT UNIFORM COMBINATIONS FOR FALCONS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/look-three-straight-home-games-with-three-different-uniform-combination-19907987|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=December 4, 2017|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. But due to the NFL's one-shell rule that prevented them from resurrecting the red helmets, the Falcons instead wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s.\n\nIt was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the [[2020 NFL season]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Shook|first=Nick|title=Atlanta Falcons to have new uniforms for 2020 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001096746/article/atlanta-falcons-to-have-new-uniforms-for-2020-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=January 14, 2020|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n===New Orleans Saints===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Falcons\u2013Saints rivalry}}\nIn every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the [[New Orleans Saints]] (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South).

The NFL had planned to add two teams in {{nfly|1967}}; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in {{nfly|1966}}. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to {{nfly|1960}}: 12 games over 13 weeks).

Under head coach [[Norb Hecker]], Atlanta lost their first nine regular season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling [[1966 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 20 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at [[1966 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], and beat [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis]] in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.  The team finished the 1960s with 12 wins in four seasons.\n\nThe Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta during the [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|1970]] season, a 20\u20137 loss to the [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].

The following week, they lost to the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 27\u201320 in the Divisional Playoffs.\n\nIn the [[1980 Atlanta Falcons season|1980]] season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12\u20134 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30\u201327 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened [[1982 Atlanta Falcons season|1982]] season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 30\u201324. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss. The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years.\n\n===1989\u20131996===\nIn the [[1989 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.\n\n[[File:Atlanta Falcons at Los Angeles Rams 1991-12-08 - 01 (Atlanta Falcons crop).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons playing against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during a 1991 away game.]]\n\nAfter defeating the [[1991 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|1991]] season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. In the [[1991 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nIn [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|1992]], the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.\n\n===1997\u20132000: The Dan Reeves era===\nIn 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201310, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14\u20132 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] 30\u201327, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34\u201319 to the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].\n\nIn the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back [[Jamal Anderson]], who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5\u201311 regular season record.<ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\"/> In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4\u201312 and once again missing the playoffs.\n\n===2001\u20132006===\nIn the [[2001 NFL draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]).\n\nThe Falcons finished the [[2001 Atlanta Falcons season|2001 season]] with a record of 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. [[Jessie Tuggle]] retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, [[Arthur M. Blank]] reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2001/12/17/weekinbiz.html | title=Arthur Blank buys Falcons from Smith family | date=December 17, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular season record of 9\u20136\u20131, tying the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. [[Wade Phillips]] acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5\u201311 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, [[Jim L. Mora]], was hired and Vick returned for the [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|full season]]. The Falcons went 11\u20135, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], 47\u201317, in the [[Georgia Dome]], advancing to the [[NFC Championship Game]], which they lost to the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], 27\u201310.\n\nThe [[2005 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in {{nfly|2005}}, going 8\u20138. In {{nfly|2006}}, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7\u20139, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and [[Bobby Petrino]], the [[University of Louisville]]'s football coach, replaced him. Before the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.\n\n===2007===\n{{main|2007 Atlanta Falcons season}}\nFor the 2007 season, the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Falcons]] were forced to start [[Joey Harrington]] at quarterback.

The first was the [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]], sharing with the [[Atlanta Braves]] [[Major League Baseball]] team until 1991. In 1992, the [[Georgia Dome]] was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for [[college football]], including [[Georgia State Panthers football|Georgia State]] football and college bowl games such as the [[Peach Bowl]].\n\nIn an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future [[Super Bowl]], team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods.

In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] (white and gold) and the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team has worn black facemasks since then.\n\nA prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the [[1974 Atlanta Falcons season|1974 season]], but was never worn.\n\nIn [[1990 Atlanta Falcons season|1990]], the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in [[1997 Atlanta Falcons season|1997]]. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)\n\nBoth the logo and uniforms changed in [[2003 Atlanta Falcons season|2003]]. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter ''F''.<ref name=\"NewFalconsLogo2003\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Uniform History|url=https://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/pdf/media-guides/ATL-Media-Guide.pdf#page=377|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=2019 Atlanta Falcons Media Guide|date=August 13, 2019|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Falcons unveil new uniforms at fan rally|url=http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=April 24, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705011150/http://atlantafalcons.com/news/press_releases.cfm?cont_id=177215|archive-date=July 5, 2003|access-date=August 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], winning the first two contests (24\u201321 in {{nfly|2004}} and 36\u201317 in {{nfly|2005}}), but losing 31\u201313 in {{nfly|2006}}. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34\u201314. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14\u20133. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 \u2013 against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team.\n\nThe Falcons unveiled an all-red [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL AND NIKE REVEAL COLOR RUSH UNIFORMS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/nfl-and-nike-reveal-color-rush-uniforms-17676181|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tabeek|first=Matthew|title=LOOK: THREE STRAIGHT HOME GAMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT UNIFORM COMBINATIONS FOR FALCONS|url=https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/look-three-straight-home-games-with-three-different-uniform-combination-19907987|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AtlantaFalcons.com|date=December 4, 2017|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. But due to the NFL's one-shell rule that prevented them from resurrecting the red helmets, the Falcons instead wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s.\n\nIt was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the [[2020 NFL season]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Shook|first=Nick|title=Atlanta Falcons to have new uniforms for 2020 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001096746/article/atlanta-falcons-to-have-new-uniforms-for-2020-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=January 14, 2020|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n===New Orleans Saints===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Falcons\u2013Saints rivalry}}\nIn every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the [[New Orleans Saints]] (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South).

After playing briefly with Art Blakey (1956), and mastering alto and baritone saxophone, Sullivan moved south to Florida and out of the spotlight in the early 60s.   His reluctance to travel limited his opportunities to play with musicians of the first rank, but Sullivan continued to play in the Miami area, often in schools and churches.   Contact with local younger players, notably [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Pat Metheny]] led to teaching and to a broadening of his own musical roots to include the lessons of [[John Coltrane]]'s music and elements of jazz rock.   With the addition of flute and soprano saxophone to his armoury, Sullivan moved to New York and in 1980 formed a quintet with legendary bop trumpeter [[Red Rodney]].  Resisting the temptation to follow current trends and play the music of their youth, Sullivan and Rodney worked on new material and fostered young talent to produce some fresh and stimulating music.    Ira and his longtime friend and collaborator Stu Katz,  jazz [[pianist]] and [[vibraphonist]], co-led a multi-night performance with Katz at [[Joe Segal]]'s [[The Jazz Showcase]] in [[Chicago]].  A live recording of some of those performances, ''A Family Affair: Live At Joe Segal's Jazz Showcase'', was released in 2011. In 2014, Ira Sullivan performed in concert with jazz vocalist [[Erin McDougald]] for a live-recorded concert at 35th Street Studios which featured pianist-guitarist Rob Block, bassist Kelly Sill and drummer Charles Heath along with multi-reed player Marc Berner.
