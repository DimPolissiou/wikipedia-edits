AKP is also widely accredited for overcoming the 2001 economic crisis in Turkey by following International Monetary Fund guidelines, as well as successfully weathering the 2008 financial crisis. From 2002-2011 the Turkish economy grew on average by 7.5 percent annually, thanks to lower inflation and interest rates. The government under AKP also backed extensive privatization programs. The average income in Turkey rose from $2,800 U.S. in 2001 to around $10,000 U.S. in 2011, higher than income in some of the new EU member states. Other reforms included increasing civilian representation over military in areas of national security, education and media, and grant broadcasting and increased cultural rights to Kurds. On Cyprus, AKP supported unification of Cyprus, something deeply opposed by the Turkish military, leading almost to a military coup in 2004. Other AKP reforms included lifting bans on religious and conservative dress, such as headscarves, in universities and public institutions. AKP also ended discrimination against students from religious high schools, who previously had to meet additional criteria in areas of education and upon entry to universities. AKP is also accredited for bringing the Turkish military under civilian rule, a paradigm shift for a country that had experienced constant military meddling for almost a century.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/research/turkey-the-new-model/</ref> \n\nControversies over whether the party remains committed to [[Secularism|secular principles]] enshrined in the [[Turkish constitution]] have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. Turkey's constitution establishes the country as a secular state and prohibits any political parties that promote Islamism or shariah law. Some activists, commentators, opponents and government officials have accused the party of Islamism, which has resulted in unsuccessful closure cases, such as the one in 2008 brought about by the lifting of a long-standing university ban on headscarves.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/turkey.nato1|title=Turkey's governing party avoids being shut down for anti-secularism|author=Robert Tait|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2008-07-30}}</ref> The party denies allegations of Islamism and affirms that it is committed to secularism.

The chief prosecutor charged the Justice and Development Party with abusing the law and justice. He based his case on the fact that the party's leader had been banned from political life for reading an Islamist poem, and thus the party had no standing in elections. The [[European Commission]] had previously criticised Turkey for banning the party's leader from participating in elections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey mulls banning leading party before elections |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/turkey-mulls-banning-leading-party-elections/article-111091|date=October 23, 2002|publisher=EurActiv |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial}}\nThe party again faced a [[2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial|closure trial in 2008]].

Even if it were a political symbol, does that give [one the] right to ban it? Could you bring prohibitions to symbols?\" These statements led to a joint proposal of the Justice and Development Party and the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] for changing the constitution and the law to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves at state universities. Soon afterwards, Turkey's chief prosecutor, [[Abdurrahman Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya]], asked the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] to close down the party on charges of violating the [[Secularism in Turkey|separation of religion and state]] in Turkey.<ref name=\"hurr0730\">{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-634073 |title=From landmark success to closure: AKP's journey |work=[[Turkish Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-07-22 |first=Izgi |last=Gungor }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|accessdate=2008-11-16|title=Closure case against ruling party creates shockwaves|date=2008-03-15|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421214216/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|archivedate=2008-04-21}}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|accessdate=2008-09-04|title=Full text of testimony|work=[[Milliyet]]|language=Turkish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512171455/http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|archive-date=2011-05-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The closure request failed by only one vote, as only 6 of the 11 judges ruled in favour, with 7 required; however, 10 out of 11 judges agreed that the Justice and Development Party had become \"a center for anti-secular activities\", leading to a loss of 50% of the state funding for the party.<ref>''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 19 August 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html AKP to ask for retrial by Constitutional Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820065944/http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html |date=2013-08-20 }}</ref>\n\n=== Elections ===\n==== 2002 general elections ====\nThe AKP won a sweeping victory in the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 elections]], which saw every party previously represented in the Grand National Assembly ejected from the chamber. In the process, it won a two-thirds majority of seats, becoming the first Turkish party in 11 years to win an outright majority. Erdo\u011fan, as the leader of the biggest party in parliament, would have been normally given the task to form a cabinet. However according to the Turkish Constitution Article 109 the Prime Ministers had to be also a representative of the Turkish Parliament.  Erdagan, who was banned from holding any political office after a 1994 incident in which he read a poem deemed pro-Islamist by judges, was therefore not. As a result, G\u00fcl became prime minister. It survived the crisis over the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] despite a massive back bench rebellion where over a hundred AKP MPs joined those of the opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) in parliament to prevent the government from allowing the [[United States]] to launch a Northern offensive in Iraq from Turkish territory. Later, Erdo\u011fan's ban was abolished with the help of the CHP and Erdo\u011fan became prime minister by being selected to parliament after a [[2003 Siirt Province by-election|by-election in Siirt]].\n\n[[File:AK Party poster after the parliamentary elections in 2007.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Party leader Erdo\u011fan on a poster thanking the people for the election results.]]\nThe AKP has undertaken structural reforms, and during its rule Turkey has seen rapid growth and an end to its three decade long period of high inflation rates.

The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote and deadlocked the election process. At the same time, Erdo\u011fan claimed the failure to elect a president was a failure of the Turkish political system and proposed to modify the constitution.\n\nThe AKP achieved victory in the rescheduled July 22, 2007 elections with 46.6% of the vote, translating into control of 341 of the 550 available parliamentary seats. Although the AKP received significantly more votes in 2007 than in 2002, the number of parliamentary seats they controlled decreased due to the rules of the [[Elections in Turkey|Turkish electoral system.]] However, they retained a comfortable ruling majority.<ref name=vote2007 /> \"[[No Stopping, Push On!]]\" was the slogan of the Justice and Development Party in the general elections of 2007.\n\nTerritorially, the elections of 2007 saw a major advance for the AKP, with the party outpolling the pro-Kurdish [[Democratic Society Party]] in traditional Kurdish strongholds such as [[Van Province|Van]] and [[Mardin Province|Mardin]], as well as outpolling the secular-left CHP in traditionally secular areas such as [[Antalya Province|Antalya]] and [[Artvin Province|Artvin]]. Overall, the AKP secured a plurality of votes in 68 of Turkey's 81 provinces, with its strongest vote of 71% coming from [[Bing\u00f6l Province|Bing\u00f6l]].

The reform package was first vetoed by [[Ahmet Necdet Sezer|President Sezer]]. Then he applied to the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Turkish constitutional court]] about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court did not find any problems in the package and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.\n\nThe reforms consisted of:\n* electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament;\n* reducing the presidential term from seven years to five;\n* allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term;\n* holding general elections every four years instead of five;\n* reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.\n\n==== 2009 local elections ====\nThe Turkish local elections of 2009 took place during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]]. After the success of the AKP in the 2007 general elections, the party saw a decline in the local elections of 2009. In these elections the AKP received 39% of the vote, 3% less than in the local elections of 2004. Still, the AKP remained the dominating party in Turkey. The second party CHP received 23% of the vote and the third party MHP received 16% of the vote. The AKP won in Turkey's largest cities: [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329100431/http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |title=Turkish local elections, 2009 |date=2009-03-29 |publisher=[[NTV-MSNBC]] |section=International / Europe }}</ref>\n\n==== 2010 constitutional referendum ====\nReforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign.

The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.\n\n==== 2014 elections ====\nIn the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|presidential election of 2014]], the AKP's long time leader Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was elected President. In the party's [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|first extraordinary congress]], former foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] was unanimously elected unopposed as party leader and took over as Prime Minister on 28 August 2014.  Davuto\u011flu stepped down as Prime Minister on 4 May 2016 following policy disagreements with President Erdo\u011fan.  Presidential aide Cemil Ertem said to Turkish TV that the country and its economy would stabilize further \"when a prime minister more closely aligned with President Erdo\u011fan takes office\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey PM Ahmet Davuto\u011flu to quit amid reports of Erdo\u011fan rift|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36213401|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015 general election ====\nIn the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|general election]] held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye B\u00fcy\u00fck Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party and the power to form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)]], HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.\n\n==== 2019 local elections ====\nIn the [[2019 Turkish local elections|2019 local elections]], the ruling party AKP lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 25 years, as well as 5 of Turkey's 6 largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to AKP's mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as alleged government inaction on the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey|Syrian refugee crisis]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-election-intl/index.html|title=Istanbul election rerun won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan|author=Isil Sariyuce and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/world/europe/istanbul-mayor-election-erdogan.html|title=Turkey's President Suffers Stinging Defeat in Istanbul Election Redo|last=Gall|first=Carlotta|date=2019-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Soon after the elections, the Turkish government ordered a [[June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|re-election in Istanbul]].

AKP is also widely accredited for overcoming the 2001 economic crisis in Turkey by following International Monetary Fund guidelines, as well as successfully weathering the 2008 financial crisis. From 2002-2011 the Turkish economy grew on average by 7.5 percent annually, thanks to lower inflation and interest rates. The government under AKP also backed extensive privatization programs. The average income in Turkey rose from $2,800 U.S. in 2001 to around $10,000 U.S. in 2011, higher than income in some of the new EU member states. Other reforms included increasing civilian representation over military in areas of national security, education and media, and grant broadcasting and increased cultural rights to Kurds. On Cyprus, AKP supported unification of Cyprus, something deeply opposed by the Turkish military, leading almost to a military coup in 2004. Other AKP reforms included lifting bans on religious and conservative dress, such as headscarves, in universities and public institutions. AKP also ended discrimination against students from religious high schools, who previously had to meet additional criteria in areas of education and upon entry to universities. AKP is also accredited for bringing the Turkish military under civilian rule, a paradigm shift for a country that had experienced constant military meddling for almost a century.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/research/turkey-the-new-model/</ref> \n\nControversies over whether the party remains committed to [[Secularism|secular principles]] enshrined in the [[Turkish constitution]] have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. Turkey's constitution establishes the country as a secular state and prohibits any political parties that promote Islamism or shariah law. Some activists, commentators, opponents and government officials have accused the party of Islamism, which has resulted in unsuccessful closure cases, such as the one in 2008 brought about by the lifting of a long-standing university ban on headscarves.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/turkey.nato1|title=Turkey's governing party avoids being shut down for anti-secularism|author=Robert Tait|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2008-07-30}}</ref> The party denies allegations of Islamism and affirms that it is committed to secularism.

The chief prosecutor charged the Justice and Development Party with abusing the law and justice. He based his case on the fact that the party's leader had been banned from political life for reading an Islamist poem, and thus the party had no standing in elections. The [[European Commission]] had previously criticised Turkey for banning the party's leader from participating in elections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey mulls banning leading party before elections |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/turkey-mulls-banning-leading-party-elections/article-111091|date=October 23, 2002|publisher=EurActiv |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial}}\nThe party again faced a [[2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial|closure trial in 2008]].

Even if it were a political symbol, does that give [one the] right to ban it? Could you bring prohibitions to symbols?\" These statements led to a joint proposal of the Justice and Development Party and the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] for changing the constitution and the law to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves at state universities. Soon afterwards, Turkey's chief prosecutor, [[Abdurrahman Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya]], asked the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] to close down the party on charges of violating the [[Secularism in Turkey|separation of religion and state]] in Turkey.<ref name=\"hurr0730\">{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-634073 |title=From landmark success to closure: AKP's journey |work=[[Turkish Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-07-22 |first=Izgi |last=Gungor }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|accessdate=2008-11-16|title=Closure case against ruling party creates shockwaves|date=2008-03-15|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421214216/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|archivedate=2008-04-21}}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|accessdate=2008-09-04|title=Full text of testimony|work=[[Milliyet]]|language=Turkish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512171455/http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|archive-date=2011-05-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The closure request failed by only one vote, as only 6 of the 11 judges ruled in favour, with 7 required; however, 10 out of 11 judges agreed that the Justice and Development Party had become \"a center for anti-secular activities\", leading to a loss of 50% of the state funding for the party.<ref>''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 19 August 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html AKP to ask for retrial by Constitutional Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820065944/http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html |date=2013-08-20 }}</ref>\n\n=== Elections ===\n==== 2002 general elections ====\nThe AKP won a sweeping victory in the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 elections]], which saw every party previously represented in the Grand National Assembly ejected from the chamber. In the process, it won a two-thirds majority of seats, becoming the first Turkish party in 11 years to win an outright majority. Erdo\u011fan, as the leader of the biggest party in parliament, would have been normally given the task to form a cabinet. However according to the Turkish Constitution Article 109 the Prime Ministers had to be also a representative of the Turkish Parliament.  Erdagan, who was banned from holding any political office after a 1994 incident in which he read a poem deemed pro-Islamist by judges, was therefore not. As a result, G\u00fcl became prime minister. It survived the crisis over the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] despite a massive back bench rebellion where over a hundred AKP MPs joined those of the opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) in parliament to prevent the government from allowing the [[United States]] to launch a Northern offensive in Iraq from Turkish territory. Later, Erdo\u011fan's ban was abolished with the help of the CHP and Erdo\u011fan became prime minister by being selected to parliament after a [[2003 Siirt Province by-election|by-election in Siirt]].\n\n[[File:AK Party poster after the parliamentary elections in 2007.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Party leader Erdo\u011fan on a poster thanking the people for the election results.]]\nThe AKP has undertaken structural reforms, and during its rule Turkey has seen rapid growth and an end to its three decade long period of high inflation rates.

The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote and deadlocked the election process. At the same time, Erdo\u011fan claimed the failure to elect a president was a failure of the Turkish political system and proposed to modify the constitution.\n\nThe AKP achieved victory in the rescheduled July 22, 2007 elections with 46.6% of the vote, translating into control of 341 of the 550 available parliamentary seats. Although the AKP received significantly more votes in 2007 than in 2002, the number of parliamentary seats they controlled decreased due to the rules of the [[Elections in Turkey|Turkish electoral system.]] However, they retained a comfortable ruling majority.<ref name=vote2007 /> \"[[No Stopping, Push On!]]\" was the slogan of the Justice and Development Party in the general elections of 2007.\n\nTerritorially, the elections of 2007 saw a major advance for the AKP, with the party outpolling the pro-Kurdish [[Democratic Society Party]] in traditional Kurdish strongholds such as [[Van Province|Van]] and [[Mardin Province|Mardin]], as well as outpolling the secular-left CHP in traditionally secular areas such as [[Antalya Province|Antalya]] and [[Artvin Province|Artvin]]. Overall, the AKP secured a plurality of votes in 68 of Turkey's 81 provinces, with its strongest vote of 71% coming from [[Bing\u00f6l Province|Bing\u00f6l]].

The reform package was first vetoed by [[Ahmet Necdet Sezer|President Sezer]]. Then he applied to the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Turkish constitutional court]] about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court did not find any problems in the package and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.\n\nThe reforms consisted of:\n* electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament;\n* reducing the presidential term from seven years to five;\n* allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term;\n* holding general elections every four years instead of five;\n* reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.\n\n==== 2009 local elections ====\nThe Turkish local elections of 2009 took place during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]]. After the success of the AKP in the 2007 general elections, the party saw a decline in the local elections of 2009. In these elections the AKP received 39% of the vote, 3% less than in the local elections of 2004. Still, the AKP remained the dominating party in Turkey. The second party CHP received 23% of the vote and the third party MHP received 16% of the vote. The AKP won in Turkey's largest cities: [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329100431/http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |title=Turkish local elections, 2009 |date=2009-03-29 |publisher=[[NTV-MSNBC]] |section=International / Europe }}</ref>\n\n==== 2010 constitutional referendum ====\nReforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign.

The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.\n\n==== 2014 elections ====\nIn the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|presidential election of 2014]], the AKP's long time leader Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was elected President. In the party's [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|first extraordinary congress]], former foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] was unanimously elected unopposed as party leader and took over as Prime Minister on 28 August 2014.  Davuto\u011flu stepped down as Prime Minister on 4 May 2016 following policy disagreements with President Erdo\u011fan.  Presidential aide Cemil Ertem said to Turkish TV that the country and its economy would stabilize further \"when a prime minister more closely aligned with President Erdo\u011fan takes office\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey PM Ahmet Davuto\u011flu to quit amid reports of Erdo\u011fan rift|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36213401|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015 general election ====\nIn the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|general election]] held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye B\u00fcy\u00fck Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party and the power to form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)]], HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.\n\n==== 2019 local elections ====\nIn the [[2019 Turkish local elections|2019 local elections]], the ruling party AKP lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 25 years, as well as 5 of Turkey's 6 largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to AKP's mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as alleged government inaction on the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey|Syrian refugee crisis]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-election-intl/index.html|title=Istanbul election rerun won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan|author=Isil Sariyuce and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/world/europe/istanbul-mayor-election-erdogan.html|title=Turkey's President Suffers Stinging Defeat in Istanbul Election Redo|last=Gall|first=Carlotta|date=2019-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Soon after the elections, the Turkish government ordered a [[June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|re-election in Istanbul]].

The community was founded in Troyes, France in 1875 by [[Louis Brisson]] and are affiliated with the [[Oblate Sisters of St. Francis de Sales]].\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Young Louis Brisson.jpg|thumb|Pere Louis Brisson]]\nAn order of [[Nun|cloistered nuns]], the [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary]], was founded by [[Francis de Sales]] at the request of [[Jane Frances de Chantal]] in 1610.  The establishment of [[Oratory of St. Philip Neri|an Oratory]] at [[Thonon-les-Bains|Thonon]], where Francis served as the first Provost, was a preparatory step toward carrying out his design, the accomplishment of which was prevented by his death. With Chantal's encouragement and assistance, Raymond Bonal of Adge, in France, carried out his plan, but this congregation died out at the beginning of the 18th century.  Two hundred years later it was revived by Mother [[Marie de Sales Chappuis]] (died 7 October 1875) and Abb\u00e9 [[Louis Brisson]], a professor in the Seminary of [[Troyes]]. In 1869, Fr Brisson established Saint Bernard Coll\u00e8ge, near Troyes.  In September 1871, Fr Gilbert (died 10 November 1909) joined him and [[Bishop of Troyes#From 1800|Emmanuel-Jules Ravinet, Bishop of Troyes]], received them and four companions into the [[novitiate]].<ref name=Catholic/>\n\n[[Pope Pius IX]] temporarily approved their constitutions on 21 December 1875.  The first [[vows]] were made 27 August 1876.  The definitive approbation of their constitution was given on 8 December 1897.<ref name=Catholic/>\n\n===Development===\nThe congregation gradually developed in France. It numbered seven colleges and five other educational houses when the Government closed them all, 31 July 1903.  The founder retired to Plancy where he died 2 February 1908. The Generalate was transferred to Rome, and in 1909, the church of Sts. Celsus and Julian in was entrusted to them.  Oblate refers to persons, especially in the Middle Ages, who offered themselves and their property to a monastery.\n\n==Today==\nThe members of this religious order are of two states, [[Priest|clerics]] and [[lay brother]]s. Today the Oblates are located throughout the world, in Holland, Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, India, South Africa, Namibia, Benin, Ivery Coast, Uruguay, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Haiti and the United States.<ref>[https://www.desalesoblates-sar.net/about-us OSFS South African Region]</ref> The Generalate is located in Rome. \n\nThe order is governed by a [[superior general]] elected every six years; and four counsellors general elected by the [[general chapter]].

The one-year Novitiate is taken up with studies, particularly Salesian spirituality. For the first three years following first vows, Oblate renew their vows annually, and then profess perpetual vows. Generally, a Ministerial Internship takes place after the novitiate.
