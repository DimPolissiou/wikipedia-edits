When Yuri, born from Dongmyeong's previous wife in [[Dongbuyeo]], came to Goguryeo and became the heir to the throne, Biryu and Onjo moved south to found their own kingdoms.<ref name=\"KOREA\">Jinwung Kim, \u00abA History of Korea: From \"Land of the Morning Calm\" to States in Conflict\u00bb, p.38, Indiana University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0253000785}}</ref> According to the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'', Biryu founded his kingdom in Michuhol ([[Hangul|\ubbf8\ucd94\ud640]]/[[Hanja|\u5f4c\u9112\u5ffd]]), but his didn't last long.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /> Biryu's people joined Sipje after Biryu's death and Onjo renamed it to Baekje. After that, the capital city of Baekje was moved southward from Habuk Wiryeseong because the [[Malgal]] were located at the North and [[Lelang Commandery|Nangnang]] was located to the East.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /> Both capital cities correspond to land within current Seoul. In 3 BC and 8 BC, the [[Malgal]] tribes attacked from the north, and both times, Onjo directly led his armies and won victories over the invaders. In 5 BC, Onjo moved the capital city to a more defensible location south of the Han River, renaming it Hanam Wiryeseong, and sent a messenger to the king of the [[Mahan confederacy]] telling him of the recent action.<ref name=\"KOREA\" />\n\nAt this time, Onjo already had plans of conquering Mahan and [[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]]. By 7 AD, he was already preparing his armies for war and finally attacked during 8 AD. In 8 AD, he secretly took his armies across the border, laying the deceit that he was going to hunt in the forests. Soon, all of Mahan except for two fortresses were conquered.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /><ref name=\"Jin\">Duk-kyu Jin, \u00abHistorical Origins of Korean Politics\u00bb, p.87, 2005, {{ISBN|8942330630}}</ref> The citizens of the last two Mahan fortresses surrendered to Onjo and were given mercy. The Mahan King, however, committed suicide and left a letter for Onjo, asking him to take in Mahan's people with kindness and mercy. Onjo respected the Mahan King's last request and took his people in.\n\nBaekje had expanded greatly, and several fortresses were being built every year. Peace lasted for 8 years until 16 AD, when a former Mahan general caused a rebellion. Onjo directly led an army of 5,000 and successfully destroyed the rebellion. Soon after this, the Malgal tribes invaded again during 22 AD, but were once again defeated by Onjo and his army.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /><ref name=\"Jin\" />\n\n== Death and succession ==\nOnjo died of natural causes in 28 AD, during the 46th year of his reign. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Daru of Baekje|Daru]]. Onjo laid the foundations for a powerful dynasty that would last for 678 years and 31 rulers.\n\n==Samguk Sagi==\n\"''The first ancestor of the Baekje [kings] was King Onjo. His father was Chumo, also known as Jumong. From Bukbuyeo he escaped peril and arrived in Jolbon Buyeo. The king of Buyeo was without a male child, and only had three daughters. Upon seeing Jumong, they knew he was not an ordinary man, and made his second daughter [Jumong's] wife. Shortly thereafter, the king of Buyeo deid. Jumong succeeded him to the throne and had two children. The oldest was called Biryu, and the next was called Onjo (it is also said that Jumong went to Jolbon and married a woman from Wolgun, and that he had two sons [by her]). Now Jumong, when he was in Bukbuyeo, had one son, who came and became the crown prince. Biryu and Onjo were afraid that they would not be treated well by the one who had become crown prince, and so with Ogan, Mayeo, and some other ten ministers went south with a large number of commoners following them. Then they reached Mt. Hansan and climbed themselves to the summit to look upon the land where they were. Biryu wanted to settle on the beach, and the ten ministers admonished him, saying \"But the land to the south of the river: in the north it is bordered by the Han river, and the East occupied by high mountain peaks; the south faces marshland, and the west is guarded by the sea. This benefits of this divinely strategic land possess a fate not easily acquired. Why should you not make your capital in this place? However Biryu did not listen, and divided the people, and he reverted to Michuhol and settled there. Onjo made his capital south of the river in Wiryeseong, and the ten ministers assisted him, and the country was called Sipje. This happened in the third year of Hongjia, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Early Han. Biryu was in Michu, where the earth was wet and the rivers salty, and could not dwell in security. Then he returned to look upon Wirye, where the capital and its villages were stable as a three-legged cauldron, and the people dwelt in security. Then he was ashamed and died. His ministers and people all returned to Wirye. Afterwards in the times that came the people were happy and obedient, and the name [of the kingdom] was changed to Baekje. Its lineage and that of Kogyureo are both out of Buyeo, therefore they took the surname Buyeo.\nOne version says, the first ancestor was King Biryu, and that his father was Utae, an illegitimate grandson of the king of Bukbuyeo Hae Buru. His mother was Soseono, a daughter of Yeon Ta-bal (\u5ef6\u9640\u52c3), a man of Jolbon. She was married to Utae and gave birth to two sons. The oldest was called Biryu, and the younger called Onjo. Utae died and she was widowed, and settled in Jolbon. After some time Jumong was not well-treated in Buyeo \u2013 this was during the second year of Jianzhao in early Han [during the reign of Emperor Yuan]. In spring of the second month, he fled south to Jolbon and established the capital of Goguryeo. He married Soseono and she became his consort, and because she, in the creation of his realm, rendered great assistance, Jumong especially favored them and received Biryu and the other as if they were his own sons. When Jumong was in Buyeo he had a child Yuryu by a woman of the Ye clan, and when he came he was made crown prince and the one who would succeed him. Therefore, Biryu asked his younger brother Onjo, saying \u201cOriginally the great king fled the difficulties in Buyeo and escaped here. Our mother's clan poured out the riches of their house to aid in the endeavor [of creating the kingdom], and her toils were many. Now the great king has left this world, and the state has fallen to Yuryu, and if we were to follow along here it would be as depressing as a tumor. Would it not be respectful to our mother's clan if we went to the south and divined the land, and established a separate capital?\u201d Then he and his brother many factions, and crossed the Pae and Dae rivers, and arrived in Michuhol and settled there.\nThe Pei Shih and Book of Sui both tell that one descendant of Dongmyeong was Gutae who was sincere in his benevolence. When he first established his country in the territory of the former commandery of Daifang, the prefect of the Han territory of Liaodong, Gongsun Du, had his daughter marry [Gutae]. Afterwards [his country] became a powerful state among the Eastern Barbarians.\nIt is unknown which is true [of these accounts].''\"\n* '''18 BC''', spring, fifth month. The court of King Dongmyeong was established.\n* '''17 BC''', spring, first month. The king asked the myriad ministers, saying, \"The Mohe assemble on my northern boder, and these people are fierce and have many tricks. We should ready our soldiers, store up grain, and make a plan for our defense. Third month. The king, because the clan leader Euleum possessed both knowledge and bravery, appointed him Marshal Bulwark of the Right, and entrusted him with matters relating to the soldiers and horses.\n* '''16 BC''', autumn, ninth month. The Mohe invaded the northern border. The king led powerful soldiers to a quick attack and defeated them handily. The rebels who lived to return were only one or two of every ten. Winter, tenth month. There was lightning, and the peaches and plums blossomed.\n* '''15 BC''', spring and summer, there was drought, famine, and plague. Autumn, eighth month. Envoys were sent to Lelang to cultivate favor.\n* '''14 BC''', winter, tenth month. The king took a tour of the northern regions to console them. He went hunting and got a supernal deer.\n* '''13 BC''', autumn, seventh month, last day of the month (\u8f9b\u672a\u6666). There was a solar eclipse.\n* '''11 BC''', spring, second month. Three thousand of the Mohe came and surrounded Wiryeseong. The king shut the fort and would not go out. After ten days time the rebels had depleted their stores and returned. The king led a sharp thrust and chased them to the Daebuhyeon, where he fought and overcame them. Over 500 were killed or captured. Autumn, seventh month. The fort of Masuseong was constructed, and a palisade was erected at Mt. Byeongsan. The prefect of Lelang sent a messenger to report: \u201cRecently you inquired about connecting in good favor, with the intention of making us like the same family. But now at the boundary of our territory you have built a fortress and a palisade. Is this some scheme to munch away [our territory] like a silkworm? If there is no change in our former good relations, then destroy the fort and tear down the palisade, and accordingly we will feel no more doubt. However, if you do not approve, then we request a battle to decide winner and loser.\nThen the king said, \u201cDoing construction at strategic points and protecting the country has been the usual way of things from the past up to now. How dare you change our peaceful relations because of this. You should not have any doubts about this matter! If you presume to lead out a force because of this, then accordingly our tiny country will await you.\u201d Therefore, peaceful relations with Lelang were lost.\n* '''9 BC''', autumn, ninth month. The king went hunting and got a supernal deer, which was sent to Mahan. Winter, tenth month. The Mohe invaded the northern frontier. The king dispatched 200 soldiers and they gave battle on the bank of the Gonmi river. Our army failed, and set in at Mt. Cheongbok to defend themselves. The king himself led 100 elite cavalry and went out to Bonghyeon to help them. The bandits saw this and retreated.\n* '''8 BC''', summer, fourth month. Lelang sent the Mohe to attack the palisade at Mt. Byeongsan. They killed or captured over 100 people. In autumn, seventh month, the twin palisades of Mt. Doksan and Gucheon River were constructed, thereby blocking the road to Lelang.\n* '''6 BC''', spring, second month. In the king's capital and old woman changed into a man, and five tigers came into the fort. The king's mother died. She was 61 years old. Summer, fifth month. The king asked his ministers, saying, \u201cThe state in the east is Lelang and to the north are the Mohe, and they attack our borders. Days of peace are few, and now there are incidents of strange omens that are seen again and again. Also, the country's mother has passed, and things will not settle down on their own. It is necessary to move the country. Earlier I went took a look at the land south of the Han river where the soil is fertile and suitable for our capital.

When Yuri, born from Dongmyeong's previous wife in [[Dongbuyeo]], came to Goguryeo and became the heir to the throne, Biryu and Onjo moved south to found their own kingdoms.<ref name=\"KOREA\">Jinwung Kim, \u00abA History of Korea: From \"Land of the Morning Calm\" to States in Conflict\u00bb, p.38, Indiana University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0253000785}}</ref> According to the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'', Biryu founded his kingdom in Michuhol ([[Hangul|\ubbf8\ucd94\ud640]]/[[Hanja|\u5f4c\u9112\u5ffd]]), but his didn't last long.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /> Biryu's people joined Sipje after Biryu's death and Onjo renamed it to Baekje. After that, the capital city of Baekje was moved southward from Habuk Wiryeseong because the [[Malgal]] were located at the North and [[Lelang Commandery|Nangnang]] was located to the East.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /> Both capital cities correspond to land within current Seoul. In 3 BC and 8 BC, the [[Malgal]] tribes attacked from the north, and both times, Onjo directly led his armies and won victories over the invaders. In 5 BC, Onjo moved the capital city to a more defensible location south of the Han River, renaming it Hanam Wiryeseong, and sent a messenger to the king of the [[Mahan confederacy]] telling him of the recent action.<ref name=\"KOREA\" />\n\nAt this time, Onjo already had plans of conquering Mahan and [[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]]. By 7 AD, he was already preparing his armies for war and finally attacked during 8 AD. In 8 AD, he secretly took his armies across the border, laying the deceit that he was going to hunt in the forests. Soon, all of Mahan except for two fortresses were conquered.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /><ref name=\"Jin\">Duk-kyu Jin, \u00abHistorical Origins of Korean Politics\u00bb, p.87, 2005, {{ISBN|8942330630}}</ref> The citizens of the last two Mahan fortresses surrendered to Onjo and were given mercy. The Mahan King, however, committed suicide and left a letter for Onjo, asking him to take in Mahan's people with kindness and mercy. Onjo respected the Mahan King's last request and took his people in.\n\nBaekje had expanded greatly, and several fortresses were being built every year. Peace lasted for 8 years until 16 AD, when a former Mahan general caused a rebellion. Onjo directly led an army of 5,000 and successfully destroyed the rebellion. Soon after this, the Malgal tribes invaded again during 22 AD, but were once again defeated by Onjo and his army.<ref name=\"KOREA\" /><ref name=\"Jin\" />\n\n== Death and succession ==\nOnjo died of natural causes in 28 AD, during the 46th year of his reign. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Daru of Baekje|Daru]]. Onjo laid the foundations for a powerful dynasty that would last for 678 years and 31 rulers.\n\n==Samguk Sagi==\n\"''The first ancestor of the Baekje [kings] was King Onjo. His father was Chumo, also known as Jumong. From Bukbuyeo he escaped peril and arrived in Jolbon Buyeo. The king of Buyeo was without a male child, and only had three daughters. Upon seeing Jumong, they knew he was not an ordinary man, and made his second daughter [Jumong's] wife. Shortly thereafter, the king of Buyeo deid. Jumong succeeded him to the throne and had two children. The oldest was called Biryu, and the next was called Onjo (it is also said that Jumong went to Jolbon and married a woman from Wolgun, and that he had two sons [by her]). Now Jumong, when he was in Bukbuyeo, had one son, who came and became the crown prince. Biryu and Onjo were afraid that they would not be treated well by the one who had become crown prince, and so with Ogan, Mayeo, and some other ten ministers went south with a large number of commoners following them. Then they reached Mt. Hansan and climbed themselves to the summit to look upon the land where they were. Biryu wanted to settle on the beach, and the ten ministers admonished him, saying \"But the land to the south of the river: in the north it is bordered by the Han river, and the East occupied by high mountain peaks; the south faces marshland, and the west is guarded by the sea. This benefits of this divinely strategic land possess a fate not easily acquired. Why should you not make your capital in this place? However Biryu did not listen, and divided the people, and he reverted to Michuhol and settled there. Onjo made his capital south of the river in Wiryeseong, and the ten ministers assisted him, and the country was called Sipje. This happened in the third year of Hongjia, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Early Han. Biryu was in Michu, where the earth was wet and the rivers salty, and could not dwell in security. Then he returned to look upon Wirye, where the capital and its villages were stable as a three-legged cauldron, and the people dwelt in security. Then he was ashamed and died. His ministers and people all returned to Wirye. Afterwards in the times that came the people were happy and obedient, and the name [of the kingdom] was changed to Baekje. Its lineage and that of Kogyureo are both out of Buyeo, therefore they took the surname Buyeo.\nOne version says, the first ancestor was King Biryu, and that his father was Utae, an illegitimate grandson of the king of Bukbuyeo Hae Buru. His mother was Soseono, a daughter of Yeon Ta-bal (\u5ef6\u9640\u52c3), a man of Jolbon. She was married to Utae and gave birth to two sons. The oldest was called Biryu, and the younger called Onjo. Utae died and she was widowed, and settled in Jolbon. After some time Jumong was not well-treated in Buyeo \u2013 this was during the second year of Jianzhao in early Han [during the reign of Emperor Yuan]. In spring of the second month, he fled south to Jolbon and established the capital of Goguryeo. He married Soseono and she became his consort, and because she, in the creation of his realm, rendered great assistance, Jumong especially favored them and received Biryu and the other as if they were his own sons. When Jumong was in Buyeo he had a child Yuryu by a woman of the Ye clan, and when he came he was made crown prince and the one who would succeed him. Therefore, Biryu asked his younger brother Onjo, saying \u201cOriginally the great king fled the difficulties in Buyeo and escaped here. Our mother's clan poured out the riches of their house to aid in the endeavor [of creating the kingdom], and her toils were many. Now the great king has left this world, and the state has fallen to Yuryu, and if we were to follow along here it would be as depressing as a tumor. Would it not be respectful to our mother's clan if we went to the south and divined the land, and established a separate capital?\u201d Then he and his brother many factions, and crossed the Pae and Dae rivers, and arrived in Michuhol and settled there.\nThe Pei Shih and Book of Sui both tell that one descendant of Dongmyeong was Gutae who was sincere in his benevolence. When he first established his country in the territory of the former commandery of Daifang, the prefect of the Han territory of Liaodong, Gongsun Du, had his daughter marry [Gutae]. Afterwards [his country] became a powerful state among the Eastern Barbarians.\nIt is unknown which is true [of these accounts].''\"\n* '''18 BC''', spring, fifth month. The court of King Dongmyeong was established.\n* '''17 BC''', spring, first month. The king asked the myriad ministers, saying, \"The Mohe assemble on my northern boder, and these people are fierce and have many tricks. We should ready our soldiers, store up grain, and make a plan for our defense. Third month. The king, because the clan leader Euleum possessed both knowledge and bravery, appointed him Marshal Bulwark of the Right, and entrusted him with matters relating to the soldiers and horses.\n* '''16 BC''', autumn, ninth month. The Mohe invaded the northern border. The king led powerful soldiers to a quick attack and defeated them handily. The rebels who lived to return were only one or two of every ten. Winter, tenth month. There was lightning, and the peaches and plums blossomed.\n* '''15 BC''', spring and summer, there was drought, famine, and plague. Autumn, eighth month. Envoys were sent to Lelang to cultivate favor.\n* '''14 BC''', winter, tenth month. The king took a tour of the northern regions to console them.

Three thousand of the Mohe came and surrounded Wiryeseong. The king shut the fort and would not go out. After ten days time the rebels had depleted their stores and returned. The king led a sharp thrust and chased them to the Daebuhyeon, where he fought and overcame them. Over 500 were killed or captured. Autumn, seventh month. The fort of Masuseong was constructed, and a palisade was erected at Mt. Byeongsan. The prefect of Lelang sent a messenger to report: \u201cRecently you inquired about connecting in good favor, with the intention of making us like the same family. But now at the boundary of our territory you have built a fortress and a palisade. Is this some scheme to munch away [our territory] like a silkworm? If there is no change in our former good relations, then destroy the fort and tear down the palisade, and accordingly we will feel no more doubt. However, if you do not approve, then we request a battle to decide winner and loser.\nThen the king said, \u201cDoing construction at strategic points and protecting the country has been the usual way of things from the past up to now. How dare you change our peaceful relations because of this. You should not not have any doubts about this matter! If you presume to lead out a force because of this, then accordingly our tiny country will await you.\u201d Therefore, peaceful relations with Lelang were lost.\n* '''9 BC''', autumn, ninth month. The king went hunting and got a supernal deer, which was sent to Mahan. Winter, tenth month. The Mohe invaded the northern frontier. The king dispatched 200 soldiers and they gave battle on the bank of the Gonmi river. Our army failed, and set in at Mt. Cheongbok to defend themselves.

Lelang sent the Mohe to attack the palisade at Mt. Byeongsan. They killed or captured over 100 people. In autumn, seventh month, the twin palisades of Mt. Doksan and Gucheon River were constructed, thereby blocking the road to Lelang.\n* '''6 BC''', spring, second month. In the king's capital and old woman changed into a man, and five tigers came into the fort. The king's mother died. She was 61 years old. Summer, fifth month. The king asked his ministers, saying, \u201cThe state in the east is Lelang and to the north are the Mohe, and they attack our borders. Days of peace are few, and now there are incidents of strange omens that are seen again and again. Also, the country's mother has passed, and things will not settle down on their own. It is necessary to move the country. Earlier I went took a look at the land south of the Han river where the soil is fertile and suitable for our capital. There we can plan to have long-lasting stability.\u201d Autumn, seventh month. At the foot of Mt. Chwihan a palisade was built, and they relocated the households of Wiryeseong. Eighth month.
