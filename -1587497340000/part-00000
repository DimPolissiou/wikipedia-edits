To achieve these goals, it involves subsidiary organizations such as the Military Staff Committee and the Committee of Experts. \n\nMembers are elected by the African Union Executive Council and endorsed by the Assembly of the African Union so as to reflect regional balance within [[Africa]], as well as a variety of other criteria, including capacity to contribute militarily and financially to the union, political will to do so, and effective diplomatic presence at [[Addis Ababa]] <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThe council is composed of fifteen countries, of which five are elected to three-year terms, and ten to two-year terms.

However, the OAU still prioritized preventive diplomacy and believed that the [[United Nations]] should shoulder most of the responsibility for organizing peacekeeping operations <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nLater conflicts in Africa were largely mediated by African institutions rather than the UN. For example, conflicts in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] were addressed by the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. Similarly, conflicts in [[Lesotho]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] were addressed by the [[Southern African Development Community]] <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nThese sub-regional organizations' large role in addressing regional conflicts led to a debate about the effectiveness of the OAU. Members specifically wished to reform the OAU's focus on consensus-based meetings rather than on-the-ground action, since some conflicts' actors were part of the meetings and could interfere with their judgement.

Within the Protocol's text, the institutional design, subsidiary committees, powers and goals of the PSC were outlined.\n\nSpecifically, its Objectives were stated in Article 3, and its Principles were stated in Article 4.

In formal meetings, members discuss AU Commission reports, which often concern brewing conflicts <ref name=\":13\" />. In briefing sessions, PSC staff briefs members on various subject areas and themes, such as terrorism and development <ref name=\":13\" />.

But a new crisis erupted in 2012-2013, when S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces seized the capital Bangui.  In response, on 19 July 2013, the AU Peace and Security Council approved the deployment of MISCA. The transfer of authority between ECCAS/MICOPAX and the AU/MISCA mission took place on 19 December 2013.

He played collegiately at [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]].\n\nMcLee played for the [[St. Louis Rams]] of the [[NFL]] and the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[CFL]].\n\n==College career==\nDuring high school in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] (suburban Pittsburgh), McLee rushed for 1,637 yards and led the team in [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]]. McLee also [[Varsity letter|lettered]] in [[basketball]] and [[Track and field|track]].\n\nFollowing his uncle Billy and cousin Reggie McLee's footsteps, McLee attended [[West Virginia University]]. He was interested in [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], but neither one gave him offers. McLee redshirted his 2002 freshman year, learning the complex 3-3-5 defensive scheme, but was rookie of the week in practice during the game week against the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]].\n\n===Freshman (2002)===\nIn [[2002 NCAA Division I-A football season|2002]], McLee red-shirted his true freshman season.\n\n===Freshman (2003)===\nIn [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003]], McLee got more playing time with the graduation of [[Grant Wiley]], 2002's starting linebacker. Behind linebacker Scott Gyorko, McLee totaled 46 tackles for the year and three sacks. McLee recorded two tackles against [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], three tackles and a sack in the game against the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], and six tackles, a sack, and a fumble recovery against the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]]. McLee also forced fumble against Miami and [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]]. In the [[Gator Bowl]], McLee recorded six tackles.\n\n===Sophomore (2004)===\nIn [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004]], McLee played on the Mountaineer team that was expected to be National Championship contenders with [[Rasheed Marshall]], [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam \"Pacman\" Jones]], [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], and [[Kay-Jay Harris]]. Although the Mountaineers ended 8-4, McLee had a good season. McLee shared time with fellow junior Jeff Noechel, but recorded 44 tackles on the year. In an overtime win against Maryland, McLee recorded six tackles and forced a fumble. Against Virginia Tech, McLee led the team with 11 tackles and recorded a 10-yard sack against [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. McLee had a team-best eight tackles in the [[Gator Bowl]] loss to [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]].\n\n===Junior (2005)===\nIn [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]], McLee teamed up with a strong defense of [[Mike Lorello]] and [[Jahmile Addae]] at safeties. McLee earned 2005 first-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] honors, [[ESPN]] All-Conference honors, and All-[[Eastern College Athletic Conference|ECAC]] honors as the starter. McLee recorded 78 tackles, which was second-best on the team. McLee had a team-high six tackles at [[Syracuse Orange#Football history|Syracuse]] for the season-opener, a team-best 11 tackles in the [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]] win, team-best nine tackles and a sack of [[Marcus Vick]] against Virginia Tech, 10 tackles and two pass break-ups in overtime win against the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]], 30-yard interception against [[Connecticut Huskies#Football|UConn]], and was the leading tackler with 11 tackles against Pitt. McLee won Girdiron Gladiator Award from the West Virginia coaches and was the Big East player of the week against Cincinnati. He was also named MVP on defense against Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Cincinnati, and Pitt.\n\n===Senior (2006)===\nIn [[2006 NCAA Division I-A football season|2006]], McLee finally started the whole season. He finished the season with 79 tackles but no sacks. McLee had his second career interception against Connecticut, which he returned for 10 yards. McLee had 9 tackles against [[Marshall University#Athletics|Marshall]], six tackles against Maryland, six against Syracuse, six against Connecticut, six against Cincinnati, and eight tackles in the overtime win against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]]. McLee finished the season on the [[Butkus Award]] list and traveled to the [[Senior Bowl]].<ref>[http://www.nfl-draft-site.com/2007/01/official-senior-bowl-roster.html The NFL Draft Site: Official Senior Bowl Roster]</ref> In his final game as a Mountaineer, McLee totaled three tackles against [[2006 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]] in the [[Gator Bowl]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Pre-Draft===\nDuring the Senior Bowl, McLee was reported to be \"looking quick\". [[ESPN]] ranked McLee as the #14 inside linebacker in the class, out of the 29-ranked inside linebacker prospects. His toughness was praised, while his discipline and learning of schemes were issues. McLee played all three linebacking positions in college, which NFL scouts praised.\n\n===NFL Draft===\nMcLee went undrafted in the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. A day later, McLee signed with the [[St. Louis Rams]], who did not take any linebackers in the draft, as an undrafted free agent. \"It's a slap in the face,\" McLee said. \"Not one of us was drafted.

He played collegiately at [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]].\n\nMcLee played for the [[St. Louis Rams]] of the [[NFL]] and the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[CFL]].\n\n==College career==\nDuring high school in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] (suburban Pittsburgh), McLee rushed for 1,637 yards and led the team in [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]]. McLee also [[Varsity letter|lettered]] in [[basketball]] and [[Track and field|track]].\n\nFollowing his uncle Billy and cousin Reggie McLee's footsteps, McLee attended [[West Virginia University]]. He was interested in [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], but neither one gave him offers. McLee redshirted his 2002 freshman year, learning the complex 3-3-5 defensive scheme, but was rookie of the week in practice during the game week against the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]].\n\n===Freshman (2002)===\nIn [[2002 NCAA Division I-A football season|2002]], McLee red-shirted his true freshman season.\n\n===Freshman (2003)===\nIn [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003]], McLee got more playing time with the graduation of [[Grant Wiley]], 2002's starting linebacker. Behind linebacker Scott Gyorko, McLee totaled 46 tackles for the year and three sacks. McLee recorded two tackles against [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], three tackles and a sack in the game against the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], and six tackles, a sack, and a fumble recovery against the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]]. McLee also forced fumble against Miami and [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]]. In the [[Gator Bowl]], McLee recorded six tackles.\n\n===Sophomore (2004)===\nIn [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004]], McLee played on the Mountaineer team that was expected to be National Championship contenders with [[Rasheed Marshall]], [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam \"Pacman\" Jones]], [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], and [[Kay-Jay Harris]]. Although the Mountaineers ended 8-4, McLee had a good season. McLee shared time with fellow junior Jeff Noechel, but recorded 44 tackles on the year. In an overtime win against Maryland, McLee recorded six tackles and forced a fumble. Against Virginia Tech, McLee led the team with 11 tackles and recorded a 10-yard sack against [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. McLee had a team-best eight tackles in the [[Gator Bowl]] loss to [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]].\n\n===Junior (2005)===\nIn [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]], McLee teamed up with a strong defense of [[Mike Lorello]] and [[Jahmile Addae]] at safeties. McLee earned 2005 first-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] honors, [[ESPN]] All-Conference honors, and All-[[Eastern College Athletic Conference|ECAC]] honors as the starter. McLee recorded 78 tackles, which was second-best on the team. McLee had a team-high six tackles at [[Syracuse Orange#Football history|Syracuse]] for the season-opener, a team-best 11 tackles in the [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]] win, team-best nine tackles and a sack of [[Marcus Vick]] against Virginia Tech, 10 tackles and two pass break-ups in overtime win against the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]], 30-yard interception against [[Connecticut Huskies#Football|UConn]], and was the leading tackler with 11 tackles against Pitt. McLee won Girdiron Gladiator Award from the West Virginia coaches and was the Big East player of the week against Cincinnati. He was also named MVP on defense against Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Cincinnati, and Pitt.\n\n===Senior (2006)===\nIn [[2006 NCAA Division I-A football season|2006]], McLee finally started the whole season. He finished the season with 79 tackles but no sacks. McLee had his second career interception against Connecticut, which he returned for 10 yards. McLee had 9 tackles against [[Marshall University#Athletics|Marshall]], six tackles against Maryland, six against Syracuse, six against Connecticut, six against Cincinnati, and eight tackles in the overtime win against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]]. McLee finished the season on the [[Butkus Award]] list and traveled to the [[Senior Bowl]].<ref>[http://www.nfl-draft-site.com/2007/01/official-senior-bowl-roster.html The NFL Draft Site: Official Senior Bowl Roster]</ref> In his final game as a Mountaineer, McLee totaled three tackles against [[2006 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]] in the [[Gator Bowl]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Pre-Draft===\nDuring the Senior Bowl, McLee was reported to be \"looking quick\". [[ESPN]] ranked McLee as the #14 inside linebacker in the class, out of the 29-ranked inside linebacker prospects. His toughness was praised, while his discipline and learning of schemes were issues. McLee played all three linebacking positions in college, which NFL scouts praised.\n\n===NFL Draft===\nMcLee went undrafted in the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. A day later, McLee signed with the [[St. Louis Rams]], who did not take any linebackers in the draft, as an undrafted free agent. \"It's a slap in the face,\" McLee said. \"Not one of us was drafted.

There are 8 DnaA binding sites within ''oriC'', to which DnaA binds with differential affinity. When DNA replication is about to commence, DnaA occupies all of the high and low affinity binding sites. The denatured AT-rich region allows for the recruitment of [[DnaB helicase|DnaB]] ([[helicase]]), which complexes with [[DnaC]] (helicase loader). DnaC helps the helicase to bind to and to properly accommodate the [[ssDNA]] at the 13 bp region; this is accomplished by [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] [[hydrolysis]], after which DnaC is released. [[Single-strand binding protein]]s (SSBs) stabilize the single DNA strands in order to maintain the [[replication bubble]]. [[DnaB helicase|DnaB]] is a 5'\u21923' helicase, so it travels on the [[lagging strand]]. It associates with [[DnaG]] (a [[primase]]) to form the only [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] for the [[leading strand]] and to add [[RNA]] primers on the lagging strand. The interaction between DnaG and DnaB is necessary to control the longitude of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. [[DNA polymerase III]] is then able to start [[DNA replication]].\n\nDnaA is made up of four domains: the first is the N-terminal that associates with regulatory proteins, the second is a helical linker region, the third domain is a AAA+ region that binds to ATP, and the fourth domain is the C-terminal DNA binding region.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa A, Hood IV, Berger JM | title = Mechanisms for initiating cellular DNA replication | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 82 | pages = 25\u201354 | date = 2013-01-01 | pmid = 23746253 | pmc = 4696014 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-052610-094414 }}</ref> DnaA contains two [[conserved sequence|conserved]] regions: the first is located in the central part of the protein and corresponds to the ATP-binding domain, the second is located in the C-terminal half and is involved in DNA-binding.<ref name=\"pmid7744016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth A, Messer W | title = The DNA binding domain of the initiator protein DnaA | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 2106\u201311 |date=May 1995 | pmid = 7744016 | pmc = 398312 | doi =  }}</ref>\n\n== Synthesis ==\nDnaA has the ability to bind its own [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]].

Mandi, located on the banks of [[Beas River|Beas]], is popularly known as the \"Cathedral of Temples\" and one of the oldest towns of Himachal Pradesh, with about 81 temples of different Gods and Goddesses on its periphery.<ref name=\"mandi\">{{cite web|title=International Shivaratri fair in Mandi|url=http://himachaltourism.gov.in/post/Mandi.aspx|publisher=Himachal tourism|accessdate=8 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414002705/http://himachaltourism.gov.in/post/Mandi.aspx|archivedate=14 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"shiv\">{{Cite web|url=http://mandishivratri.com/about-mandi.html|title=The International Festival|accessdate=7 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401052653/http://mandishivratri.com/about-mandi.html|archivedate=1 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"heaven\">{{Cite web|url=http://matabhimakali.com/mandi.html|title=Mandi \u2013 The Seventh Heaven|accessdate=7 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410001057/http://matabhimakali.com/mandi.html|archivedate=10 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Kashmir Shaivism]], Maha Shivaratri is celebrated by the [[Hindus]] of [[Kashmir]] and is called, \"Herath\" in Kashmiri, a word derived from the Sanskrit word \"Hararatri\" the \"Night of Hara\" (another name of Shiva). [[Shivaratri]], regarded as the most important festival of the community, for instance, is celebrated by them on trayodashi or the thirteenth of the dark half of the month of Phalguna (February\u2013March) and not on chaturdashi or the fourteenth as in the rest of the country. The reason for it is that this long drawn festival that is celebrated for one full fortnight as an elaborate ritual is associated with the appearance of [[Bhairava]] ([[Shiva]]) as a jwala-linga or a linga of flame. It has been described as Bhairavotsava in Tantric texts as on this occasion Bhairava and Bhairavi, His Shakti or cosmic energy, are propitiated through Tantric worship.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAccording to the legend associated with the origin of the worship, the linga appeared at pradoshakala or the dusk of early night as a blazing column of fire and dazzled Vatuka Bhairava and Rama (or Ramana) Bhairava, Mahadevi's mind-born sons, who approached it to discover its beginning or end but miserably failed. Exasperated and terrified they began to sing its praises and went to Mahadevi, who herself merged with the awe-inspiring jwala-linga. The Goddess blessed both Vatuka and Ramana that they would be worshipped by human beings and would receive their share of sacrificial offerings on that day and those who would worship them would have all their wishes fulfilled. As Vatuka Bhairava emerged from a pitcher full of water after Mahadevi cast a glance into it, fully armed with all his weapons (and so did Rama), he is represented by a pitcher full of water in which walnuts are kept for soaking and worshipped along with Shiva, Parvati, Kumara, Ganesha, their ganas or attendant deities, yoginis and kshetrapalas (guardians of the quarters) \u2013 all represented by clay images. The soaked walnuts are later distributed as naivedya. The ceremony is called 'vatuk barun' in Kashmiri, which means filling the pitcher of water representing the Vatuka Bhairava with walnuts and worshipping it.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[Central India]] has a large number of Shaiva followers. The [[Mahakaleshwar Temple]], [[Ujjain]] is one of the most venerated shrines consecrated to Shiva, where a large congregation of devotees gathers to offer prayers on the day of Maha Shivaratri. Tilwara Ghat in the city of [[Jabalpur]] and the Math Temple in the village of [[Jeonara]], [[Seoni]] are two other places where the festival is celebrated with much religious fervour.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Shobha Yatras would be organised by various Hindu organisations in different cities. It is a grand festival for Punjabi Hindus.\n\nIn [[Gujarat]], Maha Shivaratri mela is held at Bhavnath near [[Junagadh]] where bathing in the Mrugi (Mrigi) kund is considered holy. According to myth, Lord Shiva himself comes to bath in the Mrugi kund.\n\nIn [[West Bengal]], Maha Shivaratri is observed devoutly by unmarried girls seeking a suitable husband, often visiting Tarakeswar.\n\n===Stories & Beliefs===\nThere are several stories and beliefs associated with this auspicious event.\n====Samudra Manthan====\n\nIt is believed that on this particular day Lord Shiva gulped the [[Halahala]] produced during [[Samudra manthan]] and beheld it in his neck which bruised and turned blue, after which he was named as Neel Kanth. It is also believed that the famous [[Neelkanth Mahadev Temple]] is the place where this incident took place.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Nepal==\nMaha Shivaratri is a National Holiday in Nepal and celebrated widely in temples all over the country, but especially in the [[Pashupatinath temple]]. Thousands of devotees visit the famous [[Shakti Peetha|Shiva Shakti Peetham]] nearby as well. Holy rituals are performed all over the nation. Artists from various classical music and dance forms perform through the night. On Maha Shivaratri, married women pray for the well being of their husbands, while unmarried women pray for a husband like Shiva, considered as the ideal husband. Shiva is also worshipped as the Adi Guru (first teacher) from whom the divine wisdom originates.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Pakistan==\n[[File:Shiv Mandir Umerkot.jpg|thumb|[[Umarkot Shiv Mandir]] in Umarkot is famous for the three day [[Shivarathri]] celebration,which is attended by around 250,000 people.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1392074 | title=The thriving Shiva festival in Umarkot is a reminder of Sindh's Hindu heritage| date=27 February 2018}}</ref>]]\nHindus in Pakistan visit Shiva temples during Shivratri.
