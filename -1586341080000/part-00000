Constructed in 1904-05 by the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] in a mile-long open cut, it is one of the few NJ Transit stations with platforms below street level.\n\n==History==\nThe station had served several [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]], and then [[Erie-Lackwanna Railroad]], named passenger trains.  These included the ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]],'' ''Owl''/''New York Mail,'' ''Twilight''/''Pocono Express'' and the DLW flagship train, the ''[[Phoebe Snow (train)|Phoebe Snow]].''<ref>1954 Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad timetable http://viewoftheblue.com/photography/timetables/DLW042554.pdf</ref><ref>1961 Erie-Lackawanna timetable https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/ERIE_TABLE1_19610625.png</ref>\n\nThe station was cosmetically renovated for the 2005 [[PGA Championship]] at the [[Baltusrol Golf Club]] in nearby [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield]].

The side platform is accessible via the station overpass or directly from the Union Place parking lot, while the island platform can only be accessed via the overpass.\n\nIn the early morning hours, trains on the Gladstone Branch originate at [[Gladstone station (NJ Transit)|Gladstone Station]] with a final destination to [[Hoboken Terminal]]. Trains going to [[New York Pennsylvania Station]] (New York Penn Station) originate in [[Dover station (NJ Transit)|Dover]].\n\nOn weekends, the Gladstone Branch trains only operate between Summit and Gladstone, requiring passengers wishing to travel further east to transfer across the platform to a Morristown Line train, which operates between Dover and New York (as well as Hoboken via a transfer at [[Newark Broad Street station]]).\n\nThe station has a small [[parking lot]] on its property that slopes down from Union Place. Another large lot is across Summit Avenue, accessible from Broad Street. In the 1990s, a multistory [[parking garage]] was built on part of the Broad Street lot. In the days after the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], the city made daily chalk marks on the [[tire]]s of the many unclaimed vehicles to help identify those missing.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe station also has a waiting room with a small coffee and newspaper shop that is open at morning commute time and then through the afternoon rush hour.\n\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|'''M'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Overpass\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Walkway between platforms and station building\n\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray\" rowspan=5 width=75|'''P<br/>Platform level'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform]], doors will open on the right</small>\n|-\n|Track '''1'''\n|\u2190 {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Morristown|inline=yes}} weekdays toward [[Dover station (NJ Transit)|Dover]] or [[Hackettstown station|Hackettstown]] <small>([[Chatham station (NJ Transit)|Chatham]])</small><br/>\u2190 {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} weekdays toward [[Gladstone station (NJ Transit)|Gladstone]] <small>([[New Providence station|New Providence]])</small>\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track '''2'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Morristown|inline=yes}} weekends toward [[Dover station (NJ Transit)|Dover]] <small>([[Chatham station (NJ Transit)|Chatham]])</small><br/>{{0|\u2190}} {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Morristown|inline=yes}} toward [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]] (weekdays only) or [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York]] <small>([[Short Hills station|Short Hills]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the left or right</small>\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Track '''3'''\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=650|{{0|\u2190}} {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} weekdays toward [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]] or [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York]] <small>([[Short Hills station|Short Hills]])</small> \u2192<br/>\u2190 {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} weekends toward [[Gladstone station (NJ Transit)|Gladstone]] <small>([[New Providence station|New Providence]])</small><br/>{{0|\u2190}} {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} weekend termination track \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|'''G'''\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Street level\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Station building, ticket machines, parking\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:EL MU train waiting to depart Summit, NJ on June 21, 1968 (24070419546).jpg|Summit station in 1968\nImage:Summit NJT station.jpg|Station building on Union Place in downtown Summit\nImage:New_Jersey_Transit_6662-1.JPG|New Jersey Transit Midtown Direct train in Summit\n</gallery>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |first=A.M.|last=Douglass|title=The Railroad Trainman, Volume 29 |date=1912 |publisher=Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AszNAAAAMAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=April 3, 2020|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Herbert T. |title=Early History of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad and it's Locomotives -
