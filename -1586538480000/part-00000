Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].\n\nTennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics, such as \"[[Break, Break, Break]]\", \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", \"[[Tears, Idle Tears]]\", and \"[[Crossing the Bar]]\". Much of his verse was based on [[classical mythology|classical]] mythological themes, such as \"[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]\", although \"[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]\" was written to commemorate his friend [[Arthur Hallam]], a fellow poet and student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], after he died of a stroke at the age of 22.<ref>{{cite book|title=Queers in History| publisher=Quistory Publishers| year=2007| edition=2007| author=Stern, Keith}}</ref> Tennyson also wrote some notable [[blank verse]] including ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', \"[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]\", and \"[[Tithonus (poem)|Tithonus]]\". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.\n\nA number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplaces of the English language, including \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\" (''In Memoriam A.H.H.''), \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\".

He raised a large family and \"was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at [[Mablethorpe]] and [[Skegness]] on the eastern coast of England\". Alfred Tennyson's mother, Elizabeth Fytche (1781\u20131865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734\u20131799), vicar of [[St. James Church, Louth]] (1764) and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] and [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]]. Tennyson's father \"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\".\n\nTennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, [[Charles Tennyson Turner]], later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's [[Emily Tennyson, Lady Tennyson|future wife]]; the other was [[Frederick Tennyson]]. Another of Tennyson's brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum.\n\n==Education and first publication==\nTennyson was a student of [[King Edward&nbsp;VI Grammar School, Louth]] from 1816 to 1820.<ref name=\"Parsons\">''Poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson.''

The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] while on a holiday in [[Vienna]]. Hallam's death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \"In the Valley of Cauteretz\" and ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]'', a long poem detailing the \"Way of the Soul\".<ref name=\"H.

They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as ''[[Locksley Hall]]'', \"''[[Break, Break, Break]]''\", and ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', and a new version of ''The Lady of Shallot'', have met enduring fame. ''[[The Princess (Tennyson poem)|The Princess: A Medley]]'', a satire on women's education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics. [[W.&nbsp;S.

''Tennyson: To Strive, To Seek, To Find.'' London: Chatto and Windus, 2012.</ref> He held the position until his own death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position by turning out appropriate but often uninspired verse, such as a poem of greeting to [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]] when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King [[Edward VII]]. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in [[Charge of the Light Brigade|an ill-advised charge]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]].

Hallam's death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \"In the Valley of Cauteretz\" and ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]'', a long poem detailing the \"Way of the Soul\".<ref name=\"H.

''Tennyson: To Strive, To Seek, To Find.'' London: Chatto and Windus, 2012.</ref> He held the position until his own death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position by turning out appropriate but often uninspired verse, such as a poem of greeting to [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]] when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King [[Edward VII]]. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in [[Charge of the Light Brigade|an ill-advised charge]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]].

The insistent beat of ''Break, Break, Break'' emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson's use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive.

Nicholson connected with guitarist Todd Howe through an online posting for musicians that resulted in the creation of a firm friendship and the beginnings of a band.\n\nThey soon attracted the attention of drummer Piers Hewitt, who was just graduating from London Music School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/directory/artists/The_Boxer_Rebellion |title=The Boxer Rebellion // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref>\nTheir first project was known as Slippermen. Rob Loflin, a friend of Nicholson's from Tennessee, played bass on early sessions before leaving the band to enter medical school and being replaced by current bassist Adam Harrison, who graduated from London Music School along with Hewitt. As Slippermen they produced a single and an EP, \"Lens\" and ''The Traveler'' respectively, but received limited commercial success.\n\nAfter re-branding as The Boxer Rebellion and with a massive overhaul in their sound they reworked their ensemble and began building a fan-base.\n\nLast minute support slots at the [[London Astoria]] for alt-rock super group [[A Perfect Circle]] on 2 October 2003 as well as for [[Lenny Kravitz]] at Wembley Arena on 7 July 2004 and [[The Cooper Temple Clause]] led to more awareness in the UK music press culminating in widespread features in magazines such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'', ''The Fly'' and ''TNT''.\n\nAs a result of the PlayLouder competition, in June 2003, the band played the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] New Bands tent ahead of [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. Shortly after this appearance they were signed by [[Alan McGee]] to his ill-fated [[Poptones]] record label.\n\nTheir first single \"Watermelon\" was released by [[Poptones]] on 4 October 2003. It featured three tracks including \"The New Heavy\" which appeared on their debut LP ''Exits''.

Nicholson connected with guitarist Todd Howe through an online posting for musicians that resulted in the creation of a firm friendship and the beginnings of a band.\n\nThey soon attracted the attention of drummer Piers Hewitt, who was just graduating from London Music School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/directory/artists/The_Boxer_Rebellion |title=The Boxer Rebellion // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref>\nTheir first project was known as Slippermen. Rob Loflin, a friend of Nicholson's from Tennessee, played bass on early sessions before leaving the band to enter medical school and being replaced by current bassist Adam Harrison, who graduated from London Music School along with Hewitt. As Slippermen they produced a single and an EP, \"Lens\" and ''The Traveler'' respectively, but received limited commercial success.\n\nAfter re-branding as The Boxer Rebellion and with a massive overhaul in their sound they reworked their ensemble and began building a fan-base.\n\nLast minute support slots at the [[London Astoria]] for alt-rock super group [[A Perfect Circle]] on 2 October 2003 as well as for [[Lenny Kravitz]] at Wembley Arena on 7 July 2004 and [[The Cooper Temple Clause]] led to more awareness in the UK music press culminating in widespread features in magazines such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'', ''The Fly'' and ''TNT''.\n\nAs a result of the PlayLouder competition, in June 2003, the band played the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] New Bands tent ahead of [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. Shortly after this appearance they were signed by [[Alan McGee]] to his ill-fated [[Poptones]] record label.\n\nTheir first single \"Watermelon\" was released by [[Poptones]] on 4 October 2003. It featured three tracks including \"The New Heavy\" which appeared on their debut LP ''Exits''. The band then recorded the self-titled ''The Boxer Rebellion EP'' which featured the same songs as the \"Watermelon\" single with two new additions, \"Code Red\" and \"In Pursuit\", both songs which would be released as singles later. The EP was produced by Pete Hoffman and mastered by Ray Staff.\n\nFollowing the release of their debut EP, the band were to embark on a tour with [[The Killers]]. However while on tour with [[The Raveonettes]], Nicholson became seriously ill with a burst appendix which required five hours of surgery and months of recovery forcing them to cancel the forthcoming tour.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Helfland|first1=Ryan|title=The Boxer Rebellion \u2013 Union|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/the-boxer-rebellion-union|website=Music OMH|accessdate=1 May 2016|date=14 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Smyers|first1=Darryl|title=Nathan Nicholson of The Boxer Rebellion: \"If I Made Music In The U.S., I Probably Would Have Met People Who Were More Like Me.\"|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/nathan-nicholson-of-the-boxer-rebellion-if-i-made-music-in-the-us-i-probably-would-have-met-people-who-were-more-like-me-7059534|accessdate=1 May 2016|work=Dallas Observer|date=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''Exits'' (2005\u20132008)===\nAfter three singles following their debut EP, their first full-length album, ''[[Exits (The Boxer Rebellion album)|Exits]]'', was released on 2 May 2005. \"Watermelon\", seen as the band's signature track, was featured on ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]'' soundtrack (along with [[Razorlight]], [[The Libertines]], and [[The Buzzcocks]]).\n\nThe album was produced by Mark Robinson and Chris Sheldon at The Bunker Studios and Jacobs Studios respectively.\n''Exits'' received glowing reviews from the UK music press with features and reviews in widespread publications including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''Rock Sound'', ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Kerrang!]]''.\n\nTwo weeks after the album was released the Poptones label imploded, rendering the band without a label, which they announced at a gig at the ICA on 16 May.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIzqqVtR86Q]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> They have been unsigned ever since.<ref>{{cite web |last=Barston |first=Neill |url=http://www.maidstoneextra.co.uk/kol08/article/default.asp?article_id=25885 |title=The Boxer Rebellion |publisher=Maidstoneextra.co.uk |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904151421/http://www.maidstoneextra.co.uk/kol08/article/default.asp?article_id=25885 |archivedate=4 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe band continued to finance their own gigs and play throughout the UK and mainland Europe.

The album was released as a physical copy worldwide in August 2009.\n\nThey were the first band to partner with [[HMV]] in the UK to manufacture, promote and distribute an independent band's album due to the fact that the band could not afford to make ''Union'' available on CD, hence the digital-only release.<ref name=\"HMV\">{{cite web|title=The Boxer Rebellion & HMV in historic partnership|url=http://hmv.com/hmvweb/navigate.do?pPageID=4468|publisher=HMV|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe band released the first music video from ''Union'' for the song \"Broken Glass\", originally saved as a bonus track on the album but used as a promotional clip several months before the album was released.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
