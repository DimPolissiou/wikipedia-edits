track. Either the current name of the track (as it exists today) or the last known name of the track is shown.\n*'''Type and layout''': Approximate course length (in miles), shape, and surface type. For course length, the last known measurement provided by NASCAR is shown. Note that this figure may differ in various sources depending on the method that NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies have used to measure the track.\n*'''Location''': The state (or province, for Canadian tracks) and city (or nearest city) where each track is located.\n*'''Named race(s)''': For many years, specific names have been given to races during a given season as a way of marketing the event. Where these names are known, they are noted next to the seasons in which that name was used.\n*'''Season(s)''': NASCAR seasons in which the track hosted an event. Note that only points-paying races are counted as part of a given series' season; tracks where additional exhibition or special races have been held are included in a separate table.\n*'''Notes''': Any additional information or clarification that may be useful.

Where these names are known, they are noted next to the seasons in which that name was used.\n*'''Season(s)''': NASCAR seasons in which the track hosted an event. Note that only points-paying races are counted as part of a given series' season; tracks where additional exhibition or special races have been held are included in a separate table.\n*'''Notes''': Any additional information or clarification that may be useful.

{"title_page": "Seargent Smith Prentiss", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n'''Seargent Smith Prentiss''' (30 September 1808 in [[Portland, Maine]] \u2013 1 July 1850 in [[Natchez, Mississippi]]) was an attorney and politician. He served as a state representative in [[Mississippi]] and then was elected in 1838 as US representative from the state in the [[Twenty-fifth United States Congress]], serving one term from 1838 to 1839. Prentiss was noted as one of the most remarkable orators of his day. [[Daniel Webster]], known himself as a great orator, said that he had never heard a speaker as powerful as Prentiss.\n\n== Early life ==\nPrentiss was born 30 September 1808, in Portland, Maine. He was the son of Captain William Prentiss, a prosperous shipmaster, and his wife. Seargent contracted a virulent fever as an infant, which caused the loss of the use of his limbs for several years. His right leg never fully recovered. \n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], the economic embargo against the United Kingdom brought his father to the verge of ruin. The family relocated to [[Gorham, Maine]], near Seargent's maternal grandfather Major George Lewis and his wife.<ref name=\"memoir\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISkZAAAAYAAJ&dq=a%20memoir%20of%20s.%20s.%20prentiss&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=a%20memoir%20of%20s.%20s.%20prentiss&f=true |title=A Memoir of S. S. Prentiss. |publisher=Charles Schribner's Sons |editor=George L. Prentiss}}</ref>\n\nPrentiss attended [[Gorham Academy]] and [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]]. He graduated from Bowdoin at age 17 and began the study of law in the office of [[Josiah Pierce]] in Gorham.<ref name=\"memoir\" />\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from Bowdoin College in 1826, he went to [[Natchez, Mississippi]] as a teacher. He continued to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1829.\n\nIn 1832, he moved to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] and won a suit involving title to the most valuable part of the city. The property which he obtained as his fee made him one of the wealthiest men of Mississippi.\n\nHe was elected to the State Legislature in 1835 as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]. In July 1837, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] [[John F. H. Claiborne]] and [[Samuel J. Gholson]] were re-elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in a [[1837 Mississippi's at-large congressional district special election|special election]]. In November 1837, Mississippi held the regular election. Prentiss launched a vigorous, partisan campaign. He and fellow Whig [[Thomas J. Word]] won in an upset. Claiborne and Gholson then argued that the July result entitled them to serve full terms. The House agreed to hear Prentiss. He spoke for nine hours over three days, packing the gallery, drawing Senators, and earning a national reputation for oratory and public admiration from leading Whigs including Senators [[Henry Clay|Clay]] and Webster. The Elections Committee then required a [[1838 Mississippi's at-large congressional district special election|third election]]. Held in April 1838, it confirmed the November result. Both Whigs were seated in May late in the second session, also serving for the third session.<ref name=\"Directory\">{{cite web |url=https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=P000511 |title=Biographical Directory of the U. S. Congress |publisher=Office of the House Historian |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nHe was publicly embarrassed by his mounting financial troubles. He had made property investments based on disputed land holdings. He served only one term in Congress.\n\nPrentiss later went on the lecture circuit. He reportedly rarely gave speeches from prepared notes and, instead, would ad-lib for hours to large crowds that often begged him for more.\n \nAfter Mississippi repudiated her state bonds, Prentiss, who had opposed this action, moved to New Orleans in 1845.

He served as a state representative in [[Mississippi]] and then was elected in 1838 as US representative from the state in the [[Twenty-fifth United States Congress]], serving one term from 1838 to 1839. Prentiss was noted as one of the most remarkable orators of his day. [[Daniel Webster]], known himself as a great orator, said that he had never heard a speaker as powerful as Prentiss.\n\n== Early life ==\nPrentiss was born 30 September 1808, in Portland, Maine. He was the son of Captain William Prentiss, a prosperous shipmaster, and his wife. Seargent contracted a virulent fever as an infant, which caused the loss of the use of his limbs for several years. His right leg never fully recovered. \n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], the economic embargo against the United Kingdom brought his father to the verge of ruin. The family relocated to [[Gorham, Maine]], near Seargent's maternal grandfather Major George Lewis and his wife.<ref name=\"memoir\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISkZAAAAYAAJ&dq=a%20memoir%20of%20s.%20s.%20prentiss&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=a%20memoir%20of%20s.%20s.%20prentiss&f=true |title=A Memoir of S. S. Prentiss. |publisher=Charles Schribner's Sons |editor=George L. Prentiss}}</ref>\n\nPrentiss attended [[Gorham Academy]] and [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]]. He graduated from Bowdoin at age 17 and began the study of law in the office of [[Josiah Pierce]] in Gorham.<ref name=\"memoir\" />\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating from Bowdoin College in 1826, he went to [[Natchez, Mississippi]] as a teacher. He continued to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1829.\n\nIn 1832, he moved to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] and won a suit involving title to the most valuable part of the city. The property which he obtained as his fee made him one of the wealthiest men of Mississippi.\n\nHe was elected to the State Legislature in 1835 as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]. In July 1837, [[Democrat Party (U.S.)|Democrats]] [[John F. H. Claiborne]] and [[Samuel J. Gholson]] were re-elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in a [[1837 Mississippi's at-large congressional district special election|special election]]. In November 1837, Mississippi held the regular election. Prentiss launched a vigorous, partisan campaign. He and fellow Whig [[Thomas J. Word]] won in an upset. Claiborne and Gholson then argued that the July result entitled them to serve full terms. The House agreed to hear Prentiss. He spoke for nine hours over three days, packing the gallery, drawing Senators, and earning a national reputation for oratory and public admiration from leading Whigs including Senators [[Henry Clay|Clay]] and Webster. The Elections Committee then required a [[1838 Mississippi's at-large congressional district special election|third election]]. Held in April 1838, it confirmed the November result. Both Whigs were seated in May late in the second session, also serving for the third session.<ref name=\"Directory\">{{cite web |url=https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=P000511 |title=Biographical Directory of the U. S. Congress |publisher=Office of the House Historian |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nHe was publicly embarrassed by his mounting financial troubles. He had made property investments based on disputed land holdings. He served only one term in Congress.\n\nPrentiss later went on the lecture circuit. He reportedly rarely gave speeches from prepared notes and, instead, would ad-lib for hours to large crowds that often begged him for more.\n \nAfter Mississippi repudiated her state bonds, Prentiss, who had opposed this action, moved to New Orleans in 1845. He became a leader of the city's bar, and prominent in philanthropic work.\n \nHis death at the age of 41 in 1850 shocked the nation. Prentiss had been considered among the most gifted young men in the nation.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, [[Fern Britton]] (at the time, presenter of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''), as well as tabloid journalist [[Piers Morgan]].<ref name=\"Fern Britton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|title=Fern Britton was supposed to be Britain's Got Talent judge|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=13 January 2012|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=28 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234208/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series titled ''[[The Talent Show Story]]'' in January 2012.<ref name=\"Fern Britton\"/>\n\nThe original plan for the show was for it to be aired within 2005\u20132006, before the broadcast of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', with [[Paul O'Grady]] presenting the programme under the title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent'', after having hosted the pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a23450/ogrady-to-host-prime-time-talent-show.html|title=O'Grady to host prime-time talent show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=13 August 2005}}</ref> However, complications arose when O'Grady was involved in a row with ITV and refused to appear on another of the broadcaster's programme, eventually defecting to [[Channel 4]] to continue hosting his teatime show and effectively putting plans for the show on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|title=Paul O'Grady Quits Simon Cowell's New ITV Show!|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=23 February 2006|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=23 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718090610/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|archivedate=18 July 2007}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, O'Grady commented about the row by stating:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|date=5 September 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I did the pilot for ''Britain's Got Talent'' \u2013 which was originally going to be called ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''.

I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no way I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can't be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn 12 February 2007, following the success of ''America's Got Talent'' the previous year, ITV announced their intentions for a British series of ''Got Talent''. Their announcement revealed changes to the original plan for the programme, with [[Ant & Dec]] revealed to be the hosts for the new programme. While Cowell remained as part of the judging panel, the new plan intended for [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Cheryl Cole]]. However, both resigned before the programme was due to air, leading to Morgan being part of the panel as originally planned, and actress [[Amanda Holden]] joining him and Cowell as a judge; Hasselhoff would later join the panel for the programme's [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] after being a part of the panel for ''America's Got Talent'', while Cowell later employed Cole to be a replacement for [[Sharon Osbourne]] on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. At the same time, the broadcaster also announced that the show would be accompanied by a sister show on [[ITV2]], titled ''Britain's Got More Talent'', with [[Stephen Mulhern]] as its presenter.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nEach year's competition begins with two rounds of auditions. The first round, referred to as \"open auditions\", are held across several different cities around the UK during the Autumn months, within small venues that are attended by the producers. The second round, referred to as the \"Judges' Auditions\", are held the following year during January and February, within a select set of cities - these have commonly included [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]] - and take place within a theatre or convention hall, whose venue is chosen primarily for having the necessary facilities for handling large volumes of contestants - in particular the venue is arranged into three zones consisting of a waiting area for participants, the wings where they enter and leave, and the main stage area that they perform on. The second round's name is due to the fact that these auditions are attended to by the judges, alongside an audience who secure tickets to attend these sessions.\n\nEach participant that seeks to enter that year's competition must first submit an application to the programme, containing information about who is performing - whether a single person, a pair or trio of performers, or a small or large group - personal details regarding age, hometown, and background, what experience they have for their talent, and the nature of the act that will be performed. Eligibility for the contest is determined by what information is submitted for researchers to double-check - such information is required, per the programme's terms and conditions. Once an application is approved, the participant conducts a performance during an open audition close to where they reside (or can reach), whereupon if successful, they will be allocated a place in the second round, and at a venue that they can reach without issue. Once they arrive at the venue they are assigned to, the participant is then given a number, and remains within the venue's designated waiting area until called into the wings to prepare to perform. Once brought onto the main stage, they begin by engaging with the judges, asking a few small questions - subjects can include their name, background, and nature of their performance - whereupon they are given three minutes to conduct their performance; a backing track for their act is allowed if required.\n\nA performance ends when either the time is up, or all the judges use their buzzers - each judge has one that they can use to signal their dislike of the performance if they believe it to be unconvincing, boring, or completely unacceptable for the contest, though a buzzer can be retracted if the judge felt they used it mistakenly, such as if the participant's performance did something unexpected that changed their opinion of them. Once a performance is over, each judge will give an overview of what they thought about the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of \"Yes\", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated at that point from the competition. Beginning with the eighth series, judges can also grant an automatic place in the live rounds through the use of the \"Golden Buzzer\" situated on their panel's desk - a feature first introduced on ''[[Germany's Got Talent]]'', which can be used by any of the judges for a participant whose audition was exceptional in their opinion, regardless of the views of the others,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2014/02/12/bgt-judges-feeling-a-golden-buzz/|title=BGT judges feeling a golden buzz|date=12 February 2014|work=[[Express & Star]]|publisher=[[Midland News Association]]|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> although it may only be used once by each judge, and cannot be used again for any other participants yet to audition in that year's competition; the hosts of ''Britain's Got Talent'' may also press the Golden Buzzer for a participant, but must also adhere to the same rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a544647/britains-got-talent-is-a-golden-buzzer-a-good-idea-vote.html|title=Britain's Got Talent: Is a golden buzzer a good idea? \u2013 vote|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=17 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/ant-and-dec-couldnt-bear-taking-cowells-place-on-bgt-622489.html|title=Ant and Dec 'couldn't bear' taking Cowell's place on BGT|date=12 February 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming for each series begins during the Judges' Auditions, and always consists of recording taken from each venue of auditions and backstage scenes within the wings and waiting area. Footage taken by production staff is then edited into a series of episodes consisting of montages of scenes from multiple venues, consisting of the most notable auditions - the best, worst, and funniest made - along with interviews with some of the notable participants that auditioned, and recorded backstage scenes of the hosts overseeing the performances from the wings.\n\n===Judges' decisions===\nThis stage takes place after the auditions have been completed, and is also referred to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they will progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.\n\nFor the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]], some acts were asked to perform again, as the judges had had difficulty coming to a final decision on the semi-finalist, and thus needed to see their performance again in order to make up their minds; it is the only time in the show's history that this has happened, and has not been repeated since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/253211-britains-got-talent-shock-as-acts-have-to-perform-again-to-get-into-semi-finals/ |title=Britain's Got Talent shock as acts have to perform again to get into semi-finals &#124; TV: Latest News &#124; STV Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nContestants who make it into the semi-finals by passing both stages of auditions (or receiving a Golden Buzzer, as of series 8), are divided into groups for each round, where they must perform before the audience and judges, as well as on live television. As with the audition stage, each semi-finalist must conduct a performance before the judges - a new routine of their act - with the judges' role being to watch what is conducted and give feedback towards the end of the performance; buzzers may still be used by each judge, and the performance can be ultimately terminated if all buzzers are used. Because all semi-finalists are performing live, they are given time to prepare in advance with rehearsals, while production staff can provide assistance to those in preparing their performance - in the case of those conducting routines that incorporate a level of risk, production staff will ensure precautions are in place, including paramedics, and sometimes set up off-site venues for performances to use either live or for a pre-recorded film for the episode's live broadcast.\n\nEach semi-final can only have two participants advance into the final, and these are determined by two votes. The first is public phone-in vote - via a special phone-number, in which the last two digits correspond to each semi-finalist - that takes place once all semi-finalists have performed and during a break in the semi-final to allow for votes to be made. Once the vote period is ended and the results counted and fully verified, the semi-finalist with the highest total of votes is announced as the winner of the semi-final and secures their place in the final. The second vote involves the judges and takes place after the result, in which they vote between the two semi-finalists placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the public vote, with the participant receiving the majority vote securing their place in the finals; in the case of a tied vote, as of series 5, the semi-finalist placed 2nd in the public vote advances into the final. In addition to these votes, semi-finalists can also secure a place in the finals if chosen as a \"Wildcard\" - introduced in the sixth series, the format allows the judges to choose any eliminated semi-finalist to be appointed as their Wildcard in the finals, through a private vote conducted once the semi-finals are completed; the result of this vote is announced prior to the final's broadcast. The format was later expanded to allow for a Wildcard to be chosen by the public from any eliminated semi-finalist they liked within in the ninth and tenth series respectively, though this format was dropped before the eleventh series.<!-- It is unclear if this will be brought back. Leave as is, and amend if the format returns.-->\n\nThe finals operate in a similar manner to the semi-finals, though all participants in this stage compete primarily to win votes from the public with a new routine; the judges can still buzz and give opinions on the performance they view, but have little impact on the public's voting intention. Once the public vote has been completed, once all finalists have performed, and the votes verified and counted, the hosts announce who is placed as the top two acts of the vote, before revealing the winner who received the most votes from the public. Finalists who win receive a cash prize, and a place in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] later that year.\n\nFor the show's scheduling, the live episodes are usually arranged to take place over the course of a week - semi-finals for each weekday, and the live final aired on the Sunday of the weekend. With the exception of the first two series, the broadcast schedule of live rounds is conducted over two episodes for each - the first focuses on performances, and includes montage clips regarding each participant's background; while the second focuses on the results of the public vote, and, for the semi-finals, the vote by judges, and often include a guest performance taking place prior to the announcement of the results. Until the tenth series, live episodes were broadcast from [[The Fountain Studios]] in [[Wembley]], the same site used for ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', but following its closure in 2016,<ref name=metro160116>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Rebecca |date=16 January 2016 |title=Fountain Studios, home to The X Factor and BGT, sold for \u00a31 |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/16/fountain-studios-home-to-the-x-factor-and-bgt-sold-for-16-million-5627286/ |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref> the show relocated its live episodes to [[Elstree Studios]] in 2017, before moving to [[Hammersmith Apollo]] the following year.\n\n==Judges==\n[[File:HoldenLondon.jpg|thumb|right|Holden is the longest serving judge on the show, only being absent in a few episodes in 2012 due to health reasons.]]\n[[File:David Hasselhof at re-publica May 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Hasselhoff previously worked as a judge on ''America's Got Talent'', before joining the show for the 2011 series.]]\nFor the first four series after the show began in June 2007, the judging panel consisted of music executive and television producer [[Simon Cowell]], television and West End star [[Amanda Holden]], and newspaper editor and journalist [[Piers Morgan]].

In subsequent series, the line-up remained as Cowell, Holden, Walliams and Dixon, with no further incidents except for the eighth series in 2014 - Cowell missed the first day of the Manchester auditions, leading to [[Ant & Dec]] filling in for him, and was also absent for the final day of the London auditions - and the tenth series in 2016 - Cowell was late for an audition, and was temporarily replaced by Walliam's mother Kathleen, who was attending it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width: 50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Series\n! colspan=\"4\"|Main Judge\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Guest Judge {{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"14\" | [[Simon Cowell]] {{ref|2|2}}\n| rowspan=\"14\" | [[Amanda Holden]]\n| rowspan=4| [[Piers Morgan]]\n| rowspan=4 {{N/A}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|2]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|3]]\n| [[Kelly Brook]] {{ref|3|3}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Louis Walsh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=1| [[Michael McIntyre]]\n| rowspan=1| [[David Hasselhoff]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"9\" | [[Alesha Dixon]]\n| rowspan=\"9\" | [[David Walliams]]\n| [[Carmen Electra]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 7)|7]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 8)|8]]\n| [[Ant & Dec]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 9)|9]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 10)|10]]\n| nowrap | Kathleen Williams\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 11)|11]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|12]]\n|- \n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 13)|13]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 14 <!-- Create Wikilink WHEN ARTICLE CREATED!! -->\n|}\n\t\n;Notes\t\n{{refbegin}}\n#{{note|1}} Guest Judges mainly took the place of another judge during auditions, who were absent during specific sessions for certain reasons (i.e. medical issue).\n#{{note|2}} Cowell was not present for auditions in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]]; he served as a judge for the live shows only.\n#{{note|3}} Brook was credited as a guest judge for this series for the Manchester auditions, after the producers dropped plans for her to be a fourth judge on the programme.\n{{refend}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{See also|List of Britain's Got Talent episodes|List of Britain's Got Talent finalists}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align:center; font-size:100%; width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%; | Series\n! style=\"width:8%; | Start\n! style=\"width:8%; | Finish\n! style=\"width:4%; | Winner's prize {{ref|1|1}} \n! style=\"width:13%; background:gold;\" align=\"center\" | Winner\n! style=\"width:13%; background:silver;\" align=\"center\"| Runner-up\n! style=\"width:13%; background:tan;\" align=\"center\" | Third place\n! style=\"width:10%; | Ave. UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| {{nowrap|9 June 2007}}\n| {{nowrap|17 June 2007}}\n| rowspan=\"5\"| \u00a3100,000\n| [[Paul Potts]]\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" |{{TableTBA|N/A}}{{ref|2|2}} <!-- DO NOT place results for 2nd and 3rd place for this season - there is no evidence stating who got these positions for this season, other than the winner.

Auditions for this series took place within the cities of [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[London]] and [[Cardiff]], between January and February earlier that year. The series had 3 live semi-finals, featuring a total of 24 semi-finalists, all of whom were vying for a chance to perform at the Royal Variety Performance, as well as claiming a \u00a3100,000 cash prize. The series was won by [[opera]] singer [[Paul Potts]]; the results of the other finalists were not announced.\n\n===Series 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|Britain's Got Talent (series 2)}}\nThe second series was aired during 2008, between 12 April to 31 May, and featured notable differences. Not only did the series run for much longer, auditions took place in [[Blackpool]] and [[Glasgow]], the latter following complaints that Scotland hadn't been visited during the previous series, along with Manchester, Birmingham, London and Cardiff. In addition, the show had five live semi-finals, featuring a total of 40 semi-finalists. The series was won by street-dancer [[George Sampson]], with dual dance group [[Signature (dance group)|Signature]] coming in second, and singer [[Andrew Johnston (singer)|Andrew Johnston]] placing third.\n\n===Series 3 (2009)===\n{{Main|Britain's Got Talent (series 3)}}\nThe third series was aired during 2009, between 11 April to 30 May, with auditions held in the same five cities as before. Initially, the producers intended to change the format by including a fourth judge on the panel, but this was later dropped a few days after auditions began. The series was won by dance troupe [[Diversity (dance troupe)|Diversity]], with singer [[Susan Boyle]] coming in second, and saxophonist [[Julian Smith (saxophonist)|Julian Smith]] placing third. It is the highest watched series in the history of ''Britain's Got Talent'', attracting an average of over 13.3&nbsp;million viewers, with the contributing factor being the performances made by Boyle.\n\n===Series 4 (2010)===\n{{Main|Britain's Got Talent (series 4)}}\nThe fourth series was aired during 2010, between 17 April to 5 June; a single episode of this series, intended for airing on 22 May, was pushed back to 23 May, in order to avoid it clashing with live coverage of the [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League Final]] that year. The auditions were once more held across the same five cities as before, though the series also held auditions with [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]; the city had been originally planned to hold auditions for the previous series, but these were cancelled before this could happen. Owing to illness, Cowell was unable to attend the Birmingham auditions, which led to [[Louis Walsh]] being in brought in as a guest judge for these.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} The series was won by gymnastic troupe [[Spelbound]], with dancing duo [[Twist and Pulse]] coming in second, and drummer Kieran Gaffney placing third.\n\n===Series 5 (2011)===\n{{Main|Britain's Got Talent (series 5)}}\nThe fifth series was aired during 2011, between 16 April to 4 June, and was the first to be broadcast completely in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]; like before, a single episode intended for airing on 28 May, was pushed back to 29 May, to avoid it clashing with live coverage of the [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League Final]] that year.

For this series, the cash prize was increased from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3500,000, and a new feature was introduced called the \"Wildcard\", in which the judges could select one of the acts eliminated in the semi-finals, to return and compete in the finals. The show also increased the number of semi-finalist for the semi-finals to 45, with nine acts per semi-final, and the number of judges for the entire contest to 4; the previous series also featured four judges, albeit for the live episodes only. In addition, the show attempted to bring in a new way of voting for the semi-finals via a mobile app, but this was suspended for the series after it suffered technical problems during the first live semi-final.\n\nThis series featured an open audition in London, along with inviting other acts to audition via [[YouTube]], before holding Judges' Auditions within Birmingham, London, Manchester and Cardiff, Blackpool and [[Edinburgh]].

Audition took place within Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, and London, with the latter three cities holding open auditions in late 2014 along with Newcastle, Cardiff, [[Portsmouth]], [[Leeds]], [[Norwich]], and [[Bristol]].

In addition, the live episodes were now broadcast from [[Elstree Studios]], owing to the closure of the previous site. Auditions were held within [[City of Salford|Salford]], Birmingham, London, and Blackpool, with the latter two cities holding open auditions in late 2016, along with Peterborough, Cardiff, Edinburgh, [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], Manchester and [[Luton]].

Following his absence from the previous series' live episodes, Anthony McPartlin made his return to ''Britain's Got Talent'' this year. Auditions were held across the same cities as before, including London and Manchester. This series saw three notable events - the withdrawal of an act from the live semi-finals, despite securing a place through their audition; the surprise return of a participant from a previous series' contest, operating under a veiled alias; and the contest being won by the oldest participant to take part. The series was won by singer Colin Thackery, with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name of \"X\") coming second, and magician Ben Hart placing third.\n\n=== Series 14 (2020) ===\nThe fourteenth series is set to air in two parts, the first in April 2020 consisting of pre-recorded audition episodes, while the second containing the live rounds to be aired at a later date.

The programme is hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], features appearances by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly along with the judges for the respective year the companion show is aired in, and operates in a similar manner to the former spin off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' (the companion show of ''The X Factor''). The format, however, depends on what stage of the competition the main show is on - on the auditions stage is being broadcast, its sister show focused on highlights of acts that couldn't be shown on the main show, with Mulhern operating in a similar manner to the main show's hosts, though with interviews with participants before and after their performance; on live episodes, the sister show conducts live \"after-show\" episodes, featuring interviews with the semi-finalists/finalists, as well as chatting with the judges.\n\nThe companion show used to be aired on [[ITV2]] after each episode of the main show's currently aired series, and also included a special set set of compilation episodes featuring the best and worst auditions from that year's contest, titled ''Britain's Got Talent: Best and Worst'', but on 7 October 2019, Simon Cowell announced that ''Britain's Got More Talent'' would be shifted onto online platforms and thus provide more focus towards ''Britain's Got Talent''.

His plan was to produce a contest under the same subtitle and format as the American spin-off, focusing on bringing the best talent from across the ''Got Talent'' franchise, many from the British edition, to compete for a cash prize and the title of \"World Champion\" in the British public's opinion. Both the contest and the production of the programme began in Spring of that year, with the spin-off's planned broadcast date announced in the 2019 series finale of ''Britain's Got Talent''.<ref name=\"2019 Spin-off\" /> The spin-off premiered on 31 August 2019, with the contest won by dance act [[Twist and Pulse]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Britain's Got Talent'' has been nominated for a number of [[National Television Awards]] in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007.

He stated that \"[contestants'] deficiencies and shortcomings are as important as their talent.

He said, \"I don't think that's entertainment. I don't think they should put children on that are too young. If you're going to do that, have a separate show. Have a children's show, ''British Children Have Talent''.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Cowell responded to Forsyth, stating that: \"someone, Mr Grumpy, said we shouldn't have children your age on the show\", after the performance of dance troupe Youth Creation.<ref name=\"Jessie J\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-voice-judge-jessie-j-slams-britains-got-talent-for-allowing-children-to-audition-8640591.html |title=The Voice judge Jessie J slams Britain's Got Talent for allowing children to audition |last=O'Brien |first=Liam |date=1 June 2013 |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> [[Jessie J]] joined the debate, declaring: \"I cannot agree with kids having to go through three or four auditions when it's purely for ridicule.

In 2012, electropop band [[Superpowerless]] were approached to appear in the semi-finals. They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light. On the day they felt that all interviews, especially those with Stephen Mulhern, were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation. While many newspapers wrote articles on this topic, very few were published as the news outlets were told that running the story would cut that publication out of any advance coverage of the show in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2013/04/16/britains-got-bullies-bgts-war-on-nerds/|title=Britain's Got Bullies \u2013 BGT's War on Nerds|work=MCM BUZZ \u2013 Movies, TV, Comics, Gaming, Anime, Cosplay News & Reviews}}</ref>\n\n==Live tour==\nBetween 2008 and 2011, several of the show's semi-finalists, finalists, and winners from various series, took part in a live tour titled \"Britain's Got Talent Tour\". The event consisted of several shows held across various UK cities during the Summer months, with site locations including [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Belfast]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Nottingham]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. When the first live tour, hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], was announced on 17 April 2008, demand for tickets for the thirteen dates set for it was high. This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve - the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks - to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston. In 2009, Mulhern hosted a new live tour, which initially featured four dates before it was later increased to run for eighteen shows, and included performances by Diversity, Flawless, Aidan Davis, Shaun Smith, Stavros Flatley, Hollie Steel, 2 Grand, Julian Smith, Shaheen Jafargholi, Susan Boyle, Darth Jackson, DJ Talent and the 2008 winner, George Sampson. In 2010, a third live tour was created, featuring a much larger schedule and taking place across 16 cities and 23 shows. It was hosted by comedian [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Paddy McGuinness]], and featured performances by that year's finalists of ''Britain's Got Talent'' - [[Spelbound]], Twist & Pulse, Kieran Gaffney, Tobias Mead, Tina & Chandi, Paul Burling, Christopher Stone, Janey Cutler, Liam McNally and Connected.\n\nIn 2011, a fourth live tour was created. Hosted by Mulhern, it featured performances by the finalists of that year's ''Britain's Got Talent'' - Jai McDowall, Ronan Parke, New Bounce, Razy Gogonea, Michael Collings, Paul Gbegbaje, Steven Hall, James Hobley, Les Gibson and Jean Martyn.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLean |first=Amy |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/entertainment-in-newcastle/theatre/2011/06/13/preview-britain-s-got-talent-tour-opens-in-newcastle-72703-28868474/ |title=Preview: Britain's Got Talent Tour opens in Newcastle \u2013 Theatre & Arts \u2013 Entertainment |publisher=ChronicleLive |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> However ticket sales were drastically reduced due to low interest in the tour was as a result of the financial climate that year.

The features of the app vary from year to year but always include an interactive feature (e.g. a buzzer, polls or quizzes), relevant social media feeds and clips from the show. In 2015, free in-app voting was introduced. This means viewers are able to vote free of charge five times per voting window during the semi-finals and final rounds.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*{{itv.com|id=talent|title=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n*{{stv.tv|id=talent|title=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n*{{u.tv|id=talent|title=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n{{col-2}}\n*{{Twitter|name=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n*{{IMDb title|1034201}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n{{Britain's Got Talent}}\n{{Got Talent}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:2007 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:Britain's Got Talent| ]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ITV reality television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Thames Television]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc}}\n{{About||the Got Talent international franchise|Got Talent|the spin-off|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\n{{short description|Televised British talent competition series}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Britain's Got Talent\n| image                    = Britain's Got Talent logo.png\n| genre                    = [[Talent show]]\n| creator                  = [[Simon Cowell]]\n| director                 = Jonathan Bullen\n| presenter                = \n[[Anthony McPartlin]]<br>[[Declan Donnelly]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n| judges                   = {{plainlist| <!-- Please keep in Order of Appearance, and DO NOT include Guest Judges. -->\n* Simon Cowell <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Amanda Holden]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Piers Morgan]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Michael McIntyre]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Alesha Dixon]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. --> \n* [[David Walliams]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. --> \n}}\n| voices                   = [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]]\n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| language                 = English\n| num_series               = 14\n| num_episodes             = 185 <!-- Amend when new episodes are broadcast.

Presented by [[Anthony McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially known as [[Ant & Dec]]), it is produced by both [[Thames (production company)|Thames]] (formerly [[Talkback Thames]]) and [[Syco Entertainment]], distributed by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] every year in late Spring to early Summer. The show premiered on 9 June 2007 following the success of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' the previous year; it was initially planned for 2005, but a dispute between the broadcaster and its originally intended host led to production being suspended for two years.\n\nEvery year, contestants of any age can audition for the televised contest with whatever talent they wish to demonstrate. Auditionees seek to impress a panel of judges - at present, consisting of Simon Cowell, [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], and [[David Walliams]] - in order to secure a place in the live rounds of the contest. Once in the live rounds, participants seek to impress the public and judges to secure votes, in order to reach the final and a chance to win a cash prize and a place within that year's performances for the [[Royal Variety Performance]] before members of the [[British Royal Family]]. {{As of|2019}}, the show has had thirteen winners, ranging from musicians and singers to variety acts, magicians and dancers.\n\nOn average, ''Britain's Got Talent'' draws viewing figures of 9.9&nbsp;million viewers per series \u2013 the show's live final in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|third series]] attracted a record 17.3&nbsp;million viewers, obtaining a 64.6% audience share at the time of its broadcast.<ref name=\"prioryforweeks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/susan-boyle/5434811/Susan-Boyle-could-be-in-Priory-clinic-for-weeks-says-doctor.html|title=Susan Boyle could be in Priory clinic for weeks, says doctor|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> Each series of the main programme is accompanied by a sister show, '''''Britain's Got More Talent''''', presented by [[Stephen Mulhern]]; until October 2019, the programme was aired on [[ITV2]], but has since been moved to online platforms.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, [[Fern Britton]] (at the time, presenter of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''), as well as tabloid journalist [[Piers Morgan]].<ref name=\"Fern Britton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|title=Fern Britton was supposed to be Britain's Got Talent judge|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=13 January 2012|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=28 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234208/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series titled ''[[The Talent Show Story]]'' in January 2012.<ref name=\"Fern Britton\"/>\n\nThe original plan for the show was for it to be aired within 2005\u20132006, before the broadcast of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', with [[Paul O'Grady]] presenting the programme under the title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent'', after having hosted the pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a23450/ogrady-to-host-prime-time-talent-show.html|title=O'Grady to host prime-time talent show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=13 August 2005}}</ref> However, complications arose when O'Grady was involved in a row with ITV and refused to appear on another of the broadcaster's programme, eventually defecting to [[Channel 4]] to continue hosting his teatime show and effectively putting plans for the show on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|title=Paul O'Grady Quits Simon Cowell's New ITV Show!|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=23 February 2006|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=23 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718090610/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|archivedate=18 July 2007}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, O'Grady commented about the row by stating:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|date=5 September 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I did the pilot for ''Britain's Got Talent'' \u2013 which was originally going to be called ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''.

I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no way I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can't be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn 12 February 2007, following the success of ''America's Got Talent'' the previous year, ITV announced their intentions for a British series of ''Got Talent''. Their announcement revealed changes to the original plan for the programme, with [[Ant & Dec]] revealed to be the hosts for the new programme. While Cowell remained as part of the judging panel, the new plan intended for [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Cheryl Cole]]. However, both resigned before the programme was due to air, leading to Morgan being part of the panel as originally planned, and actress [[Amanda Holden]] joining him and Cowell as a judge; Hasselhoff would later join the panel for the programme's [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] after being a part of the panel for ''America's Got Talent'', while Cowell later employed Cole to be a replacement for [[Sharon Osbourne]] on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. At the same time, the broadcaster also announced that the show would be accompanied by a sister show on [[ITV2]], titled ''Britain's Got More Talent'', with [[Stephen Mulhern]] as its presenter.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nEach year's competition begins with two rounds of auditions. The first round, referred to as \"open auditions\", are held across several different cities around the UK during the Autumn months, within small venues that are attended by the producers. The second round, referred to as the \"Judges' Auditions\", are held the following year during January and February, within a select set of cities - these have commonly included [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]] - and take place within a theatre or convention hall, whose venue is chosen primarily for having the necessary facilities for handling large volumes of contestants - in particular the venue is arranged into three zones consisting of a waiting area for participants, the wings where they enter and leave, and the main stage area that they perform on. The second round's name is due to the fact that these auditions are attended to by the judges, alongside an audience who secure tickets to attend these sessions.\n\nEach participant that seeks to enter that year's competition must first submit an application to the programme, containing information about who is performing - whether a single person, a pair or trio of performers, or a small or large group - personal details regarding age, hometown, and background, what experience they have for their talent, and the nature of the act that will be performed. Eligibility for the contest is determined by what information is submitted for researchers to double-check - such information is required, per the programme's terms and conditions. Once an application is approved, the participant conducts a performance during an open audition close to where they reside (or can reach), whereupon if successful, they will be allocated a place in the second round, and at a venue that they can reach without issue. Once they arrive at the venue they are assigned to, the participant is then given a number, and remains within the venue's designated waiting area until called into the wings to prepare to perform. Once brought onto the main stage, they begin by engaging with the judges, asking a few small questions - subjects can include their name, background, and nature of their performance - whereupon they are given three minutes to conduct their performance; a backing track for their act is allowed if required.\n\nA performance ends when either the time is up, or all the judges use their buzzers - each judge has one that they can use to signal their dislike of the performance if they believe it to be unconvincing, boring, or completely unacceptable for the contest, though a buzzer can be retracted if the judge felt they used it mistakenly, such as if the participant's performance did something unexpected that changed their opinion of them. Once a performance is over, each judge will give an overview of what they thought about the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of \"Yes\", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated at that point from the competition. Beginning with the eighth series, judges can also grant an automatic place in the live rounds through the use of the \"Golden Buzzer\" situated on their panel's desk - a feature first introduced on ''[[Germany's Got Talent]]'', which can be used by any of the judges for a participant whose audition was exceptional in their opinion, regardless of the views of the others,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2014/02/12/bgt-judges-feeling-a-golden-buzz/|title=BGT judges feeling a golden buzz|date=12 February 2014|work=[[Express & Star]]|publisher=[[Midland News Association]]|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> although it may only be used once by each judge, and cannot be used again for any other participants yet to audition in that year's competition; the hosts of ''Britain's Got Talent'' may also press the Golden Buzzer for a participant, but must also adhere to the same rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a544647/britains-got-talent-is-a-golden-buzzer-a-good-idea-vote.html|title=Britain's Got Talent: Is a golden buzzer a good idea? \u2013 vote|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=17 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/ant-and-dec-couldnt-bear-taking-cowells-place-on-bgt-622489.html|title=Ant and Dec 'couldn't bear' taking Cowell's place on BGT|date=12 February 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming for each series begins during the Judges' Auditions, and always consists of recording taken from each venue of auditions and backstage scenes within the wings and waiting area. Footage taken by production staff is then edited into a series of episodes consisting of montages of scenes from multiple venues, consisting of the most notable auditions - the best, worst, and funniest made - along with interviews with some of the notable participants that auditioned, and recorded backstage scenes of the hosts overseeing the performances from the wings.\n\n===Judges' decisions===\nThis stage takes place after the auditions have been completed, and is also referred to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they will progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.\n\nFor the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]], some acts were asked to perform again, as the judges had had difficulty coming to a final decision on the semi-finalist, and thus needed to see their performance again in order to make up their minds; it is the only time in the show's history that this has happened, and has not been repeated since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/253211-britains-got-talent-shock-as-acts-have-to-perform-again-to-get-into-semi-finals/ |title=Britain's Got Talent shock as acts have to perform again to get into semi-finals &#124; TV: Latest News &#124; STV Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nContestants who make it into the semi-finals by passing both stages of auditions (or receiving a Golden Buzzer, as of series 8), are divided into groups for each round, where they must perform before the audience and judges, as well as on live television. As with the audition stage, each semi-finalist must conduct a performance before the judges - a new routine of their act - with the judges' role being to watch what is conducted and give feedback towards the end of the performance; buzzers may still be used by each judge, and the performance can be ultimately terminated if all buzzers are used. Because all semi-finalists are performing live, they are given time to prepare in advance with rehearsals, while production staff can provide assistance to those in preparing their performance - in the case of those conducting routines that incorporate a level of risk, production staff will ensure precautions are in place, including paramedics, and sometimes set up off-site venues for performances to use either live or for a pre-recorded film for the episode's live broadcast.\n\nEach semi-final can only have two participants advance into the final, and these are determined by two votes. The first is public phone-in vote - via a special phone-number, in which the last two digits correspond to each semi-finalist - that takes place once all semi-finalists have performed and during a break in the semi-final to allow for votes to be made. Once the vote period is ended and the results counted and fully verified, the semi-finalist with the highest total of votes is announced as the winner of the semi-final and secures their place in the final. The second vote involves the judges and takes place after the result, in which they vote between the two semi-finalists placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the public vote, with the participant receiving the majority vote securing their place in the finals; in the case of a tied vote, as of series 5, the semi-finalist placed 2nd in the public vote advances into the final. In addition to these votes, semi-finalists can also secure a place in the finals if chosen as a \"Wildcard\" - introduced in the sixth series, the format allows the judges to choose any eliminated semi-finalist to be appointed as their Wildcard in the finals, through a private vote conducted once the semi-finals are completed; the result of this vote is announced prior to the final's broadcast. The format was later expanded to allow for a Wildcard to be chosen by the public from any eliminated semi-finalist they liked within in the ninth and tenth series respectively, though this format was dropped before the eleventh series.<!-- It is unclear if this will be brought back. Leave as is, and amend if the format returns.-->\n\nThe finals operate in a similar manner to the semi-finals, though all participants in this stage compete primarily to win votes from the public with a new routine; the judges can still buzz and give opinions on the performance they view, but have little impact on the public's voting intention. Once the public vote has been completed, once all finalists have performed, and the votes verified and counted, the hosts announce who is placed as the top two acts of the vote, before revealing the winner who received the most votes from the public. Finalists who win receive a cash prize, and a place in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] later that year.\n\nFor the show's scheduling, the live episodes are usually arranged to take place over the course of a week - semi-finals for each weekday, and the live final aired on the Sunday of the weekend. With the exception of the first two series, the broadcast schedule of live rounds is conducted over two episodes for each - the first focuses on performances, and includes montage clips regarding each participant's background; while the second focuses on the results of the public vote, and, for the semi-finals, the vote by judges, and often include a guest performance taking place prior to the announcement of the results. Until the tenth series, live episodes were broadcast from [[The Fountain Studios]] in [[Wembley]], the same site used for ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', but following its closure in 2016,<ref name=metro160116>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Rebecca |date=16 January 2016 |title=Fountain Studios, home to The X Factor and BGT, sold for \u00a31 |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/16/fountain-studios-home-to-the-x-factor-and-bgt-sold-for-16-million-5627286/ |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref> the show relocated its live episodes to [[Elstree Studios]] in 2017, before moving to [[Hammersmith Apollo]] the following year.\n\n==Judges==\n[[File:HoldenLondon.jpg|thumb|right|Holden is the longest serving judge on the show, only being absent in a few episodes in 2012 due to health reasons.]]\n[[File:David Hasselhof at re-publica May 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Hasselhoff previously worked as a judge on ''America's Got Talent'', before joining the show for the 2011 series.]]\nFor the first four series after the show began in June 2007, the judging panel consisted of music executive and television producer [[Simon Cowell]], television and West End star [[Amanda Holden]], and newspaper editor and journalist [[Piers Morgan]].

In subsequent series, the line-up remained as Cowell, Holden, Walliams and Dixon, with no further incidents except for the eighth series in 2014 - Cowell missed the first day of the Manchester auditions, leading to [[Ant & Dec]] filling in for him, and was also absent for the final day of the London auditions - and the tenth series in 2016 - Cowell was late for an audition, and was temporarily replaced by Walliam's mother Kathleen, who was attending it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width: 50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Series\n! colspan=\"4\"|Main Judge\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Guest Judge {{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"13\" | [[Simon Cowell]] {{ref|2|2}}\n| rowspan=\"13\" | [[Amanda Holden]]\n| rowspan=4| [[Piers Morgan]]\n| rowspan=4 {{N/A}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|2]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|3]]\n| [[Kelly Brook]] {{ref|3|3}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Louis Walsh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=1| [[Michael McIntyre]]\n| rowspan=1| [[David Hasselhoff]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" | [[Alesha Dixon]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" | [[David Walliams]]\n| [[Carmen Electra]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 7)|7]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 8)|8]]\n| [[Ant & Dec]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 9)|9]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 10)|10]]\n| nowrap | Kathleen Williams\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 11)|11]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|12]]\n|- \n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 13)|13]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 14 <!-- Create Wikilink WHEN ARTICLE CREATED!! -->\n|}\n\t\n;Notes\t\n{{refbegin}}\n#{{note|1}} Guest Judges mainly took the place of another judge during auditions, who were absent during specific sessions for certain reasons (i.e. medical issue).\n#{{note|2}} Cowell was not present for auditions in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]]; he served as a judge for the live shows only.\n#{{note|3}} Brook was credited as a guest judge for this series for the Manchester auditions, after the producers dropped plans for her to be a fourth judge on the programme.\n{{refend}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{See also|List of Britain's Got Talent episodes|List of Britain's Got Talent finalists}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align:center; font-size:100%; width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%; | Series\n! style=\"width:8%; | Start\n! style=\"width:8%; | Finish\n! style=\"width:4%; | Winner's prize {{ref|1|1}} \n! style=\"width:13%; background:gold;\" align=\"center\" | Winner\n! style=\"width:13%; background:silver;\" align=\"center\"| Runner-up\n! style=\"width:13%; background:tan;\" align=\"center\" | Third place\n! style=\"width:10%; | Ave. UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| {{nowrap|9 June 2007}}\n| {{nowrap|17 June 2007}}\n| rowspan=\"5\"| \u00a3100,000\n| [[Paul Potts]]\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" |{{TableTBA|N/A}}{{ref|2|2}} <!-- DO NOT place results for 2nd and 3rd place for this season - there is no evidence stating who got these positions for this season, other than the winner.

The show also increased the number of semi-finalist for the semi-finals to 45, with nine acts per semi-final, and the number of judges for the entire contest to 4; the previous series also featured four judges, albeit for the live episodes only. In addition, the show attempted to bring in a new way of voting for the semi-finals via a mobile app, but this was suspended for the series after it suffered technical problems during the first live semi-final.\n\nThis series featured an open audition in London, along with inviting other acts to audition via [[YouTube]], before holding Judges' Auditions within Birmingham, London, Manchester and Cardiff, Blackpool and [[Edinburgh]].

While the show retained the new features introduced in the previous series, the cash prize was reduced to \u00a3250,000, with the series featuring auditions within five cities - Birmingham, London, Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester.

The series was won by boy band [[Collabro]], with opera singer Lucy Kay coming in second, and rapper duo [[Bars & Melody]] placing third.\n\n===Series 9 (2015)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 9)}}\nThe ninth series was aired during 2015, between 11 April to 31 May. This series saw the \"Wildcard\" feature updated; along with the judges being able to put forth an eliminated act from the semi-finals into the final (referred to as the Judges' Wildcard), the show now also allowed the public to vote between the three most popular eliminated acts, with the one with the highest number of votes going forward into the final - this act is referred to as the Public Wildcard. Audition took place within Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, and London, with the latter three cities holding open auditions in late 2014 along with Newcastle, Cardiff, [[Portsmouth]], [[Leeds]], [[Norwich]], and [[Bristol]]. The winner of the series was trainer and dog duo [[Jules O'Dwyer & Matisse]], with magician Jamie Raven coming second, and Welsh choir [[Ysgol Glanaethwy|C\u00f4r Glanaethwy]] placing third.\n\n===Series 10 (2016)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 10)}}\nThe tenth series was aired during 2016, between 9 April to 28 May.

In addition, the live episodes were now broadcast from [[Elstree Studios]], owing to the closure of the previous site. Auditions were held within [[City of Salford|Salford]], Birmingham, London, and Blackpool, with the latter two cities holding open auditions in late 2016, along with Peterborough, Cardiff, Edinburgh, [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], Manchester and [[Luton]].

Following the previous series, the Judges' vote was brought back into the show's format, while the live episodes were aired from [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and presented solely by Declan Donnelly; although Anthony McPartlin had stepped down from his TV commitments in March 2018, he still appeared in the series' audition episodes, which had been filmed during January and February that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-10/declan-donnelly-to-host-britains-got-talent-solo-as-ant-mcpartlin-temporarily-steps-down-from-his-tv-commitments/|title=Declan Donnelly to host Britain's Got Talent solo as Ant McPartlin temporarily 'steps down from his TV commitments'|publisher=}}</ref> Auditions were held within Manchester, Blackpool and London,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/britains-got-talent/344171-britains-got-talent-2018-auditions-judges-audition-dates-venues-tickets.html|title=Britain's Got Talent 2018 auditions: Judges' audition dates, venues, tickets|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> with two of these cities holding open auditions in 2017, alongside a number of locations within the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, and Inverness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/britainsgottalent/south-coast-bgt-2018-open-auditions-are-coming-to-a-town-near-you|title=BGT Open Auditions are coming to a town near YOU!|website=ITV.com|date=7 October 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The series was won by stand-up comedian [[Lee Ridley (comedian)|Lost Voice Guy]], with comedy singer/pianist Robert White coming second, and singer Donchez Dacres placing third.\n\n===Series 13 (2019)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\nThe thirteenth series was aired during 2019, between 6 April to 2 June. Following his absence from the previous series' live episodes, Anthony McPartlin made his return to ''Britain's Got Talent'' this year. Auditions were held across the same cities as before, including London and Manchester. This series saw three notable events - the withdrawal of an act from the live semi-finals, despite securing a place through their audition; the surprise return of a participant from a previous series' contest, operating under a veiled alias; and the contest being won by the oldest participant to take part. The series was won by singer Colin Thackery, with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name of \"X\") coming second, and magician Ben Hart placing third.\n\n=== Series 14 (2020) ===\nThe fourteenth series is set to air in two parts, the first in April 2020 consisting of pre-recorded audition episodes, while the second containing the live rounds to be aired at a later date. The decision to split the series into two parts was a result of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] pandemic and the resulting lockdown issued by the British government, which made it inadvisable to host live rounds in a time of uncertainty over health and safety in response to the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britains-got-talent|title=Britain's Got Talent|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Related programmes==\n===''Britain's Got More Talent''===\n[[File:Stephen Mulhern.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Mulhern has been the host of the sister show to ''Britain's Got Talent'', since 2007.]]\n'''''Britain's Got More Talent''''' (often shortened to '''''BGMT''''') is a companion sister show that is aired after each episode of ''Britain's Got Talent'' since the main show began in June 2007. The programme is hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], features appearances by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly along with the judges for the respective year the companion show is aired in, and operates in a similar manner to the former spin off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' (the companion show of ''The X Factor''). The format, however, depends on what stage of the competition the main show is on - on the auditions stage is being broadcast, its sister show focused on highlights of acts that couldn't be shown on the main show, with Mulhern operating in a similar manner to the main show's hosts, though with interviews with participants before and after their performance; on live episodes, the sister show conducts live \"after-show\" episodes, featuring interviews with the semi-finalists/finalists, as well as chatting with the judges.\n\nThe companion show used to be aired on [[ITV2]] after each episode of the main show's currently aired series, and also included a special set set of compilation episodes featuring the best and worst auditions from that year's contest, titled ''Britain's Got Talent: Best and Worst'', but on 7 October 2019, Simon Cowell announced that ''Britain's Got More Talent'' would be shifted onto online platforms and thus provide more focus towards ''Britain's Got Talent''. The decision was made due to changes in viewing habits from the sister show's target audience.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fans desperate to save Britain\u2019s Got More Talent after spin-off is pulled from TV |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-10-08/britains-got-more-talent-pulled-from-tv/ |accessdate=8 November 2019 |work=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Britain's Got Talent: The Champions''===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\nIn 2019, Simon Cowell opted to create a spin-off edition of the contest, following the success of the spin-off for ''America's Got Talent''. His plan was to produce a contest under the same subtitle and format as the American spin-off, focusing on bringing the best talent from across the ''Got Talent'' franchise, many from the British edition, to compete for a cash prize and the title of \"World Champion\" in the British public's opinion. Both the contest and the production of the programme began in Spring of that year, with the spin-off's planned broadcast date announced in the 2019 series finale of ''Britain's Got Talent''.<ref name=\"2019 Spin-off\" /> The spin-off premiered on 31 August 2019, with the contest won by dance act [[Twist and Pulse]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Britain's Got Talent'' has been nominated for a number of [[National Television Awards]] in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007. But has lost out to its sister shows ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. [[Ant and Dec]] have won the award for 'Most Popular Entertainment Presenters' at the same awards for twelve consecutive years (as of January 2014). ''Britain's Got Talent'' has also been nominated for two [[British Academy Television Awards]] in 2008, but failed to win any awards. In 2007 and 2008, the show was nominated at the TV Quick and Choice Awards in the 'Best Talent Show' category, losing out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' respectively.\n\nIn 2008, it was a recipient of a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award for its technical achievements. It has also won four [[Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards]] from five nominations. In 2009, it won its first ever Digital Spy Reality Award for [[George Sampson]] for 'Favourite Reality Contestant'. The show was further nominated in the 'Reality Show' category, but lost out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the 'Reality TV Presenter' category for [[Ant & Dec]] and two nominations in the 'Reality TV Judge' category for Cowell and Morgan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2012, electropop band [[Superpowerless]] were approached to appear in the semi-finals. They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light. On the day they felt that all interviews, especially those with Stephen Mulhern, were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation. While many newspapers wrote articles on this topic, very few were published as the news outlets were told that running the story would cut that publication out of any advance coverage of the show in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2013/04/16/britains-got-bullies-bgts-war-on-nerds/|title=Britain's Got Bullies \u2013 BGT's War on Nerds|work=MCM BUZZ \u2013 Movies, TV, Comics, Gaming, Anime, Cosplay News & Reviews}}</ref>\n\n==Live tour==\nBetween 2008 and 2011, several of the show's semi-finalists, finalists, and winners from various series, took part in a live tour titled \"Britain's Got Talent Tour\". The event consisted of several shows held across various UK cities during the Summer months, with site locations including [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Belfast]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Nottingham]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. When the first live tour, hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], was announced on 17 April 2008, demand for tickets for the thirteen dates set for it was high. This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve - the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks - to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston. In 2009, Mulhern hosted a new live tour, which initially featured four dates before it was later increased to run for eighteen shows, and included performances by Diversity, Flawless, Aidan Davis, Shaun Smith, Stavros Flatley, Hollie Steel, 2 Grand, Julian Smith, Shaheen Jafargholi, Susan Boyle, Darth Jackson, DJ Talent and the 2008 winner, George Sampson. In 2010, a third live tour was created, featuring a much larger schedule and taking place across 16 cities and 23 shows.

The Japanese name, {{Nihongo|\u014c mu(shi)|\u738b\u87f2}}, consists of the [[kanji]] for king and insect or bug. Transliterated as ''Ohmu'' in manga translations and as ''Ohm'' in the film's subtitles.}} She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to co-exist.\n\nLate in the night, a massive [[cargo aircraft]] from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley despite Nausica\u00e4's attempt to save it. Its sole survivor, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausica\u00e4 to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal, gargantuan humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and poises to attack, but Nausica\u00e4 uses a [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]] to calm it and guides it away from the village.\n\nSoon after, Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana, invade the Valley, execute Nausica\u00e4's father and capture the embryo. Enraged, Nausica\u00e4 assaults several Tolmekian soldiers and is about to be overwhelmed when the Valley's swordsmaster, Lord Yupa, soothes the belligerents. Kushana plans to mature the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. Yupa discovers a secret garden of jungle plants reared by Nausica\u00e4; according to her findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle's soil has been tainted by pollution.\n\nKushana leaves for the Tolmekian capital with Nausica\u00e4 and five hostages from the Valley, but a Pejite [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] shoots down the Tolmekian [[airship]]s carrying them. Nausica\u00e4, Kushana and the hostages crash-land in the jungle, disturbing several Ohms, which Nausica\u00e4 soothes. She leaves to rescue the Pejite pilot Asbel, brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausica\u00e4 realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel return to Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. A band of survivors explains that they lured the insects to eradicate the Tolmekians, and are doing the same to the Valley. They capture Nausica\u00e4 to prevent her from warning the Valley, but with the help of Asbel, his mother, and a number of sympathizers, Nausica\u00e4 escapes on her glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohms into the Valley using a wounded baby Ohm. The people of the Valley take shelter while the Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior, but tank-fire does not deter the Ohms, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.\n\nNausica\u00e4 liberates the baby Ohm and gains its trust. She and the Ohm stand before the herd but are run over. The Ohms calm down and use their golden tentacles to resuscitate her. Nausica\u00e4, her dress drenched blue with Ohm blood, walks atop golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the savior prophecy. The Ohms and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character name\n!Japanese voice actor\n!English dubbing actor<br /><small>([[Walt Disney

Nausica\u00e4, the heroine, believes in the value of life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war.

Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in greed and resentment.

However, in conducting a comparative analysis of the Japanese-language anime with their English translations, Eriko Ogihara-Schuck believes that although Disney's dub eschewed the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] of ''Warriors of the Wind'', it also \"[[Christianity|Christian]]iz[ed] Miyazaki's [[animism]]\". According to her, the translators of the film were working a language suffused with Christian [[idioms]] not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, such as the nature of humanity's relationship with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[animal]]s as seen in Christian narratives and cultural practices. Examples of these changes include when Nausica\u00e4 describes an insect as a \"good boy\", a term often used in describing [[domesticated animals]] (instead of a \"good child\", as in the Japanese version), and when Nausica\u00e4 converses with the wounded baby Ohm - in Japanese, she does not consider forgiveness from the baby a possibility, while the English version has her asking for it, albeit admitting the difficulty for the Ohm to do so. As a result of these changes, Nausica\u00e4's death and subsequent [[resurrection]] by the Ohm herd present her as a [[Christ figure]] whose self-sacrifices are for [[human]]ity, rather than for [[nature]].

Transliterated as ''Ohmu'' in manga translations and as ''Ohm'' in the film's subtitles.}} She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to co-exist.\n\nLate in the night, a massive [[cargo aircraft]] from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley despite Nausica\u00e4's attempt to save it. Its sole survivor, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausica\u00e4 to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal, gargantuan humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and poises to attack, but Nausica\u00e4 uses a [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]] to calm it and guides it away from the village.\n\nSoon after, Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana, invade the Valley, execute Nausica\u00e4's father and capture the embryo. Enraged, Nausica\u00e4 assaults several Tolmekian soldiers and is about to be overwhelmed when the Valley's swordsmaster, Lord Yupa, soothes the belligerents. Kushana plans to mature the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. Yupa discovers a secret garden of jungle plants reared by Nausica\u00e4; according to her findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle's soil has been tainted by pollution.\n\nKushana leaves for the Tolmekian capital with Nausica\u00e4 and five hostages from the Valley, but a Pejite [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] shoots down the Tolmekian [[airship]]s carrying them. Nausica\u00e4, Kushana and the hostages crash-land in the jungle, disturbing several Ohms, which Nausica\u00e4 soothes. She leaves to rescue the Pejite pilot Asbel, brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausica\u00e4 realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel return to Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. A band of survivors explains that they lured the insects to eradicate the Tolmekians, and are doing the same to the Valley. They capture Nausica\u00e4 to prevent her from warning the Valley, but with the help of Asbel, his mother, and a number of sympathizers, Nausica\u00e4 escapes on her glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohms into the Valley using a wounded baby Ohm. The people of the Valley take shelter while the Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior, but tank-fire does not deter the Ohms, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.\n\nNausica\u00e4 liberates the baby Ohm and gains its trust. She and the Ohm stand before the herd but are run over. The Ohms calm down and use their golden tentacles to resuscitate her. Nausica\u00e4, her dress drenched blue with Ohm blood, walks atop golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the savior prophecy. The Ohms and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character name\n!Japanese voice actor\n!English dubbing actor<br /><small>([[Walt Disney

Nausica\u00e4, the heroine, believes in the value of life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war.

Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in greed and resentment.

However, in conducting a comparative analysis of the Japanese-language anime with their English translations, Eriko Ogihara-Schuck believes that although Disney's dub eschewed the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] of ''Warriors of the Wind'', it also \"[[Christianity|Christian]]iz[ed] Miyazaki's [[animism]]\". According to her, the translators of the film were working a language suffused with Christian [[idioms]] not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, such as the nature of humanity's relationship with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[animal]]s as seen in Christian narratives and cultural practices. Examples of these changes include when Nausica\u00e4 describes an insect as a \"good boy\", a term often used in describing [[domesticated animals]] (instead of a \"good child\", as in the Japanese version), and when Nausica\u00e4 converses with the wounded baby Ohm - in Japanese, she does not consider forgiveness from the baby a possibility, while the English version has her asking for it, albeit admitting the difficulty for the Ohm to do so. As a result of these changes, Nausica\u00e4's death and subsequent [[resurrection]] by the Ohm herd present her as a [[Christ figure]] whose self-sacrifices are for [[human]]ity, rather than for [[nature]]. Ogihara-Schuck believes that Disney erased animistic motifs almost entirely from the film, even more so than ''Warriors of the Wind'', in order to make it more accessible for American audiences due the film's non-specific setting, since animism was retained in their versions of ''[[My Neighbour Totoro]]'', ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Ponyo]]'', as well as their own production ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.<ref name=Eriko>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Ogihara-Schuck |first=Eriko |editor1-first=A.

His family [[Immigration to Argentina|emigrated to Argentina]] when he was 4 years old, settling in the town of [[San Andr\u00e9s de Giles]] in the [[Buenos Aires Province|province of Buenos Aires]].\n\nQuarracino was ordained priest on 22 December 1945, and became a professor at the diocesan seminary of [[Mercedes, Buenos Aires|Mercedes]]. He also taught [[theology]] at the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina]].\n\nHe was appointed Bishop of [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires]], by [[Pope John XXIII]], on 3 February 1962, and received the episcopal see on 8 April of the same year. On 3 August 1968 [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] moved him to the diocese of [[Avellaneda]] (whose new cathedral was built during his rule).\n\n[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] promoted him to the Archdiocese of [[La Plata]] on 18 December 1985, and then on 10 July 1990 to the Archdiocese of [[Buenos Aires]], a see to which is attached the title of [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Argentina. He was elected to preside over the [[Argentine Episcopal Conference]] in the following November, and then reelected until 1996. He was elevated to [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''S. Maria della Salute a Primavalle'' in [[Papal consistory|consistory]] on 28 June 1991.\n\nOn 27 June 1992 he was the principal consecrator of Jorge Mario Bergoglio, S.J., later [[Pope Francis]], as bishop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bergoglio, Jorge Mario|url=http://www.aica.org/guia-s-T2Jpc3Bvcw==-91 |work=Breve biograf\u00eda de obispos|publisher=La Agencia Informativa Cat\u00f3lica Argentina|accessdate=15 March 2013|language=es}}</ref>\n\nQuarracino died in 1998 at the age of 74, due to a cardiac arrest. He was succeeded automatically by his coadjutor bishop, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Pope Francis|Jorge Mario Bergoglio]].\n\n==Views==\n===Inter-religious dialogue with Jews===\nQuarracino was a major figure of inter-religious discussion with Jews. During a visit to [[Israel]] in 1992 he was decorated by Jewish institutions for this cause, and in 1997 he had a mural painting set up in the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral of Buenos Aires]] commemorating the victims of the [[Holocaust]] and the bombings of the [[Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires|Israeli Embassy]] and the [[AMIA Bombing|AMIA]].\n\n===Social communications===\nQuarracino was inclined to journalism and, while in La Plata, he renewed the informative magazine of the archdiocese, transforming it into a full-fledged cultural publication. As Bishop of Buenos Aires, he appeared on TV regularly; he was in charge of a segment in a religious program (''Claves para un mundo mejor'') in the state-owned channel [[Canal 7 Argentina|ATC]].\n\n===Dirty War===\nQuarracino was outspoken about controversial topics. One of his first notable public statements was his support, in 1982, of a project of law that would end all investigation of the crimes of the [[Dirty War]], in order to \"contribute to national reconciliation\". This can be seen as a precedent of the ''[[Ley de Punto Final]]'', sanctioned in 1986.\n\n===Argentine politics===\nQuarracino was opposed to the policies of president [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] (1983\u20131989) and accused politicians of corruption, as the cause of \"national poverty\". However, he acknowledged being a friend of president [[Carlos Menem]] (1989\u20131999) who was heavily criticized by other Church leaders (such as [[Ra\u00fal Francisco Primatesta|Cardinal Primatesta]]).\n\n===Homosexuality===\nIn 1994, during his TV segment in ATC, Quarracino spoke against homosexuality saying that lesbians and gay men should be \"locked up in a [[ghetto]]\". This caused an accusation of discrimination, which was not considered by justice because anti-discrimination Law 23592 did not cover sexual orientation. Three years before he had termed homosexuality \"a deviation of human nature, like [[bestiality]]\".<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-55734-2005-08-28.html P\u00e1gina/12 El p\u00e1is Happy together] Domingo, 28 de agosto de 2005</ref>\n\n===Boca Juniors===\nThe Cardinal was an avowed fan of the [[Boca Juniors]] football team.
