He was educated at Gordon's College and at [[Marischal College]], both in Aberdeen. In 1872, he married Kate Mary, the daughter of Thomas Francis Robins. They had one son and a daughter.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\">''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHenderson qualified as a chartered accountant. He was a Fellow of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]].<ref name=\"The Times, 21 November 1922 p15\">The Times, 21 November 1922 p15</ref> He appeared in court often, regularly being appointed a trustee for bankrupt companies, which perhaps encouraged him to go in for the law as well. He was [[called to the Bar]] by [[Gray's Inn]] in 1897.<ref>The Times, 16 February 1906 p3</ref> He also had business interests, being a director of Thomas Bolton and Son Ltd, brass and copper manufacturers, the Lancashire United Tramways Company and other firms.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1910''; Politico\u2019s Publishing, 2004 p98</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Liberal Imperialist ===\n\nHenderson was a member of the Imperial Liberal Council.<ref>The Times, 2 October 1900 p8</ref> The Liberal Imperialists were a centrist faction within the Liberal Party in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] period, favouring a more positive attitude towards the development of the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperialism]] and opposing the party's commitment to [[Irish Home Rule]]. In domestic affairs, they advocated the concept of 'national efficiency', a policy never definitively set out, but the implication in the speeches of its leading lights was that the Liberal Party in government should take action to improve the social conditions, education and welfare of the population and reform aspects of the administration of government to maintain British economic, industrial and military competitiveness.<ref>Iain Sharpe, ''The Liberal Imperialists'' in Brack & Randall (eds.)'' The Dictionary of Liberal Thought''; Politico\u2019s 2007 pp214-216</ref>\n\n===Member of Parliament===\n\nIn 1905, the sitting MP for [[Aberdeenshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire West]], Dr Robert Farquharson, decided to stand down at the next election, and Henderson was selected in his place.<ref>The Times, 29 July 1905 p10</ref> At the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]], Henderson duly held the seat by 5,949 votes to the 2,791 polled by his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] opponent, R McNeill, a majority of 3,158.<ref>The Times, 20 January 1906 p10</ref> He voted in favour of the 1908 Women's Enfranchisement Bill.<ref>http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1908/feb/28/womens-enfranchisement-bill-1</ref> Henderson held his seat against a new [[Tory]] opponent in [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]], defeating Mr G Smith by 5,901 votes to 3,194, a majority of 2,707.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1910''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004 p98</ref> Henderson's majority again decreased at the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]]. Again facing Smith for the Unionists, Henderson won by 5,415 votes to 3,232, a reduced majority of 2,183 but still comfortably ahead.\n\n===Irish Home Rule controversy===\n\nDuring the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]], Henderson was unwittingly caught up in a row over Irish Home Rule. He received a letter from [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]] who was at the time [[Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland]]. Lord Aberdeen wrote to Henderson saying he felt fears about the consequences of Home Rule were baseless,<ref>The Times, 13 December 1910 p7</ref> especially apprehensions concerning religious intolerance and that Henderson could quote this opinion during the election.<ref name=\"The Times, 14 December 1910 p7\">The Times, 14 December 1910 p7</ref>\n\nWhile ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported that Lord Aberdeen was not taken very seriously in Ireland, his remarks nevertheless gave offence to [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] there, as the Lord-Lieutenant was supposed to stay above party politics.<ref name=\"The Times, 14 December 1910 p7\"/> The question of his alleged interference in politics then became the issue. False rumours were that Aberdeen was about to resign.<ref>The Times, 15 December 1910 p6</ref> The controversy later rumbled into 1911, with the matter being taken up by the Parliamentary Committee of Privileges.<ref>The Times, 23 March 1911 p9</ref>\n\nLord Aberdeen tried to smooth the waters by explaining that he had written to Henderson in his capacity as [[Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire]], but that backfired. In a fuller explanation later, he had to clarify that in sending his letters to Henderson he had never meant to use the authority of the Lord-Lieutenancy of Aberdeenshire to influence voters in the general election. Sensing that times were moving on, the Committee of Privileges concluded that Lord Aberdeen had not committed any breach of privilege of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>The Times, 20 May 1911 p11</ref>\n\n===1918-1919===\n\nAlthough he was by now over 70 years old, Henderson apparently had no wish to leave Parliament. His West Aberdeenshire constituency was being abolished in boundary changes for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. However, Henderson sought and won the Liberal nomination for the new seat of [[Aberdeen and Kincardine Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Central Aberdeenshire]].<ref>The Times, 12 October 1918 p3</ref> He fought the election against [[Alexander Theodore Gordon]], who stood as a Coalition Conservative, a supporter of the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]] of [[David Lloyd George]] who presumably received the [[Coalition Coupon|Coalition coupon]]. Henderson lost by 638 votes, polling 5,908 votes to Gordon's 6,546.<ref>The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico's Publishing 2004 p69</ref> Even the defeat was not sufficient to force Henderson into retirement, however. Early in 1919, Gordon died, causing a [[1919 Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire Central by-election|by-election]] in Aberdeenshire Central. It was agreed that Henderson should be the candidate and stand as a full blooded [[HH Asquith|Asquithian]] Liberal.<ref>The Times, 8 March 1919 p12</ref> That posed a difficulty for Lloyd George, who, despite his Liberalism, was being required to endorse another Conservative candidate against a Liberal who had represented the party in Parliament for 16 years. As a result, there was some speculation that Henderson would be asked to stand for the Coalition,<ref>The Times, 12 March 1919 p15</ref> which Hederson and his local Liberal Association were willing to accept this. Henderson exchanged letters with [[Freddie Guest]], the Coalition Liberal [[Chief Whip]], coming to an agreement to give overall support to the government, but the Aberdeenshire Tories would not adopt Henderson as the Coalition candidate and chose their own man, L F W Davidson.<ref>The Times, 19 March 1919 p11</ref>\n\nIn the end, Henderson decided not to contest the by-election and stood down in favour of his Liberal colleague [[Murdoch McKenzie Wood]], who won the by-election with a majority of 186 votes, in a three-cornered contest with the Unionists and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].\n\n==Appointments==\nIn 1911, Henderson was appointed as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for the County of [[Suffolk]], where he had a home in [[Felixstowe]]. He was also JP for the County of [[Surrey]], where he had another home.<ref name=\"The Times, 21 November 1922 p15\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHenderson died from [[pneumonia]] in Aberdeen <ref name=\"The Times, 21 November 1922 p15\"/> at 76.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Acommons1.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723093539/http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Acommons1.htm |archive-date=23 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was buried at [[Putney Vale Cemetery]] in [[Surrey]], near his London home in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]].<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Robert Farquharson (MP)|Robert Farquharson]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[West Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Aberdeenshire]]\n | years = [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] \u2013 [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henderson, John McDonald}}\n[[Category:Scottish Liberal Party MPs]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Aberdeen]]\n[[Category:Members of Gray's Inn]]\n[[Category:Politics of Aberdeenshire]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Aberdeen]]\n[[Category:People from Felixstowe]]\n[[Category:1846 births]]\n[[Category:1922 deaths]]\n[[Category:British accountants]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:John_M._Henderson.jpg|thumb|right|John Henderson]]\n'''John McDonald Henderson'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FCA}} (1846 \u2013 20 November 1922) was a Scottish [[chartered accountant]], [[barrister]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]].\n\n==Education and family==\nHenderson was a native of the city of [[Aberdeen]].

He was educated at [[King's College London]] and at overseas institutions. He never married.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\">''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt an early age he took over his father's business together with his brother.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> By 1910 he was described as a [[hops|hop]] merchant in Southwark.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Times House of Commons 1911''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004, p29</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===1905\u20131910===\nStrauss was adopted as Liberal candidate for the [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern or Abingdon Division]] of [[Berkshire]] in February 1905. At that time he had an address in Abingdon.<ref>''The Times'', 17 February 1905 p10</ref> He gained the seat for the Liberals at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] but lost in [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]]. However he was soon adopted as Parliamentary candidate for [[Southwark West (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark West]]. [[Richard Causton, 1st Baron Southwark|Richard Causton]] had been Liberal MP for the constituency from 1888 to January 1910, when he lost to [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate William Henry Dunn. When Causton announced he did not intend to fight again Strauss replaced him and won the seat back from Dunn by the narrow margin of 18 votes, after a recount.<ref>''The Times'', 7 December 1910 p10</ref> At the time of this victory, Strauss was described as a hop merchant in Southwark who took a prominent interest in the work of the Hops Committee (a Parliamentary Select Committee which considered questions relating to hop growing, production and consumption).<ref>''The Times'', 11 July 1908 p14</ref> He was acknowledged as an authority on agricultural questions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and was particularly interested in the plight of [[Smallholding|smallholders]] and the promotion of their rights.<ref>''The Times'', 8 January 1910 p8 & 5 June 1911 p12</ref>\n\n===1910\u20131918===\nIn 1916, Strauss was a member of a deputation to the War Minister, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] to press for better defences against air raids on London.<ref>''The Times'', 28 January 1916 p8</ref>\n\nStrauss\u2019 West Southwark constituency was abolished for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and he stood instead for the new seat of [[Southwark North (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark North]]. He was designated a Coalition Liberal, standing in support of the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]] of [[David Lloyd George]]<ref>''The Times'', 26 November 1918 p4</ref> and had presumably been issued with the [[Coalition Coupon|Coalition coupon]] as he faced no official [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] opponent. However, there were apparently Unionist objections to his candidacy because Lieutenant-General Sir John Harrington was invited to stand by local Conservatives as an Independent Unionist. Harrington agreed on the understanding that he was to be regarded as completely independent of party. Harrington had previously been a member of the recently formed right-wing [[National Party (UK, 1917)|National Party]]. Also standing against Strauss was [[George Isaacs]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and Mr J J Gebbett, a representative of the [[National Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors]] or the [[Silver Badge Party]],<ref>''The Times'', 12 December 1918 p9</ref> an organisation which was later subsumed into the [[Royal British Legion]].  Strauss held the seat with a majority of 2,071 votes over Harrington with Isaacs third and Gebbett at the foot of the poll.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1919''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004 p22</ref>\n\n===1922\u20131924===\nStrauss stood at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] as a Lloyd George [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal]].  He was opposed in a straight fight with Labour by [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Dr Leslie Haden-Guest]], the secretary and doctor to the former Labour delegation to Soviet Russia in 1920 and a [[London County Council]]lor. The election took place against the backdrop of a set of poor local election results for Labour just two weeks before, when Labour lost all their councillors in Southwark.<ref>''The Times'', 3 November 1922 p15</ref>  Strauss held his seat with a majority of 1,112.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\">F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Elections Results 1918\u20131949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p49</ref>\n\nIn [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]] Strauss, now described as a plain Liberal without prefix of suffix, again faced a straight fight against Labour's Leslie Haden-Guest. This time, despite the reunion of the Lloyd George and [[H H Asquith|Asquithian]] Liberals, and the gains the Liberal Party made overall, Strauss was beaten, albeit by the narrow margin of 362 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 7 December 1923 p6</ref> At the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] Strauss tried to win his seat back, this time in a three-cornered contest with Haden-Guest and Mr J J Llewellin for the Conservatives. Despite what was reported as a strenuous effort to regain his seat, Strauss lost by 1,030 votes, the intervention of the Unionist (who polled 3,305 votes) probably helping to deprive him of victory.<ref>''The Times'', 18 October 1924 p6</ref>\n\n===By-election, 1927===\nStrauss was handed an unusual opportunity to re-enter Parliament in 1927 when Haden-Guest resigned from the Parliamentary Labour Party in protest against the party's opposition to government policy in China, which he believed placed British nationals in Shanghai at risk and was tantamount to an intervention in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Haden-Guest then chose to resign also from Parliament and cause a by-election in which he sought re-election. He obtained the support of the local Conservative Party in Southwark but stood as an Independent Constitutionalist. He was opposed by Strauss for the Liberals and George Isaacs for Labour. Haden-Guest may not have anticipated the Liberal intervention in the by-election which he wanted to contest as a straight fight between a socialist and an anti-socialist candidate. He had envisaged his by-election as a chance to ask working class voters in particular to choose his brand of \u2018patriotism\u2019 over the attitude of the Labour Party.<ref>''The Times'', 29 March 1927 p14</ref> In the event, Strauss profited from the split in the socialist vote<ref>[[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], ''Lloyd George: The Goat in the Wilderness, 1922\u20131931;'' Cape, 1977 p162</ref> gained the seat with a majority of 1,167 over Isaacs with Haden-Guest in third place with less than 20% of the poll.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\"/>\n\n===1929===\nAt the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] Strauss again faced George Isaacs as his Labour opponent, as well as a Conservative, Marcus Samuel. The election contest was obviously a bitter one as Strauss announced he was cancelling all his public meetings which he claimed were being systematically disrupted and speakers being howled down by Labour Party supporters.<ref>''The Times'', 28 May 1929 p9</ref> This time Isaacs won the seat, by the narrow margin of 432 votes \u2013 the intervention of the Conservative candidate again splitting the anti-Labour vote.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\"/>\n\n===Liberal National===\nIn 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] led by prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] supported by a small number of [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] MPs and initially backed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However most Liberals had concerns about supporting the National coalition over the long run because of the government's commitment to protectionism and tariffs in opposition to the traditional Liberal policy of [[Free Trade]].  Despite these worries, the Liberal Party led by Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] agreed to go into the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] supporting the government.  As a result, Strauss found himself the representative of the coalition against Labour in Southwark North at the election, Marcus Samuel having agreed to stand aside.<ref>''The Times'', 9 October 1931 p14</ref> This time, with no Conservative to split the anti-Labour vote and the great popularity of the National Government as a result of the economic crisis, Strauss won back the seat in a straight fight with Isaacs by a majority of 5,992 taking 65% of the poll.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\"/>\n\nAs the initial crisis passed, the Liberal Party became increasingly anxious about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to give more open support to MacDonald's administration. Strauss was not one of the original members of this group but by 1932 he had become identified with it.<ref>''The Times'', 21 March 1932 p14</ref> By October 1932, Strauss was writing openly to Herbert Samuel expressing the view that the Liberal Party could not be revived by adopting the slogan \u2018Back to Free Trade\u2019 and that this policy was only one of a number of important issues which needed the government action.<ref>''The Times'', 6 October 1932 p7</ref>\n \nEven though he was by now 73 years of age, Strauss again stood for re-election in Southwark North as a [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National]] at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]]. Having been deprived of the seat by small majorities in the past, Strauss was this time the lucky one, squeaking home in another straight fight with Isaacs by just 79 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 16 November 1935 p18</ref> However his age and state of health told upon him and he decided to step down from Parliament at the next general election, though in fact he died before that election was held.<ref name=\"The Times, 16 March 1939 p13\">''The Times'', 16 March 1939 p13</ref>\n\n===Other public offices===\nStrauss served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for the counties of [[County of London|London]] and Berkshire.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> He was also appointed a Freeman and [[Livery Company|Liveryman]] of the [[City of London]]<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1919''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004, p22</ref> and Warden of the [[Worshipful Company of Gardeners]].<ref>''The Times'', 11 July 1910 p12</ref> In 1925, Strauss was nominated as [[Sheriff]] of Berkshire.<ref>''The Times'', 13 November 1925 p22</ref>\n\n==Election promises court case==\nIn a case which, potentially, could have had far-reaching consequences for all democratically elected representatives, Strauss found himself in court in 1913 when one of his constituents, a Mr Arthur Macgillicuddy, brought an action against him to recover damages for alleged [[breach of contract]], i.e. that Strauss had failed to carry out the promises on which he had been elected an MP. Mr Macgillicuddy, who conducted his own case, said he was seeking costs to cover his expenses (e.g. correspondence and printing) in bringing to Strauss\u2019 attention his failure to carry out his election pledges. However Judge Granger ruled that Macgillicuddy had no evidence of a contract or formal agreement with Strauss which Strauss could be found to have breached<ref>''The Times'', 20 May 1913 p3</ref> and no doubt politicians everywhere breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n==Financial troubles==\nTowards the end of his life, Strauss experienced financial difficulties because of the collapse of the grain and seed companies with which he was associated. Huge debts had been built up and the businesses were subject to compulsory [[liquidation]].  The problems had been caused by an accumulation of factors including default by debtors due to the fall in the market price of grain, government interference with the companies\u2019 trade with the US, cash-flow difficulties and bad decision making in management.<ref>''The Times'', 30 August 1935 p21</ref> While Strauss sought to distance himself from responsibility for these failures saying he had not been personally involved in the day-to-day affairs of the companies for many years, he was nevertheless brought low financially by it. His property and its contents at [[Kingston Bagpuize]], in Berkshire where he had planted hop gardens and erected modern kilns producing high-class hops<ref>''Journal of the Institute of Brewing''; Institute of Brewing, 1939 p426</ref> had to be sold off to raise funds by the liquidators<ref>''The Times'', 1 June 1935 p10</ref> as did commercial properties in London.<ref>''The Times'', 15 June 1935 p24</ref> In the 1935 general election campaign, Strauss had to issue a statement explaining his financial misfortunes and conceding that he was now \u2018an impoverished man\u2019.<ref>''The Times'', 1 November 1935 p10</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBy late 1938, now in his late seventies and with deteriorating health, Strauss was obliged to enter a nursing home.<ref name=\"The Times, 16 March 1939 p13\"/> He remained there for several months eventually dying on 25 March 1939.<ref>''The Times'',  27 March 1939, p14</ref>\n\n==By-election in North Southwark==\nIn the by-election for North Southwark, in the vacancy caused by Strauss\u2019 death, George Isaacs again took up the cudgels on behalf of the Labour Party, gaining the seat from the Liberal Nationals in a straight fight with Captain A H Henderson-Livesey by a majority of 1,493 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 18 May 1939 p16</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mr-edward-strauss | Edward Strauss }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = Member of Parliament for [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]]\n | years  = [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]]\u2013[[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|Jan. 1910]]\n | before = [[Archie Loyd]]\n | after  = [[Harold Henderson]]\n}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Sir William Dunn, 1st Baronet, of Clitheroe|Sir William Dunn]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = Member of Parliament for [[Southwark West (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark West]]\n | years = [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|Dec. 1910]]\u2013[[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished }}\n\n{{s-new | constituency }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = Member of Parliament for [[Southwark North (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark North]]\n | years = [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\u2013[[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after = [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie Haden-Guest]] }}\n\n{{succession box\n | title  = Member of Parliament for [[Southwark North (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark North]]\n | years  = [[1927 Southwark North by-election|1927]]\u2013[[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\n | before = [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie Haden-Guest]] \n | after  = [[George Isaacs]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = Member of Parliament for [[Southwark North (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark North]]\n | years  = [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]]\u2013[[1939 Southwark North by-election|1939]]\n | before = [[George Isaacs]]\n | after  = [[George Isaacs]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strauss, Edward Anthony}}\n[[Category:1862 births]]\n[[Category:1939 deaths]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1922) politicians]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1922\u20131923]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1924\u20131929]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1931\u20131935]]\n[[Category:People from Highbury]]\n[[Category:People from Southwark]]\n[[Category:People from Abingdon-on-Thames]]\n[[Category:Politics of London]]\n[[Category:Politics of the London Borough of Southwark]]\n[[Category:Politics of Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Alumni of King's College London]]\n[[Category:People from Vale of White Horse (district)]]\n[[Category:Jewish British politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the composers|Eduard Strauss|Eduard Strauss II}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Edward_Strauss.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Strauss]]\n'''Edward Anthony Strauss''' (7 December 1862 \u2013 25 March 1939) was an English corn, grain and hop merchant of German-Jewish background.<ref>Werner Eugen Mosse & Julius Carlebach, ''Second Chance: Two Centuries of German-speaking Jews in the United Kingdom''; Mohr Siebeck, 1991 p183</ref> He was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], later [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|Liberal National]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]].\n\n==Family and education==\nEdward Strauss was born in [[Highbury]] in London, the son of Joseph Strauss, a merchant from [[Southwark]]. He was educated at [[King's College London]] and at overseas institutions. He never married.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\">''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt an early age he took over his father\u2019s business together with his brother.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> By 1910 he was described as a [[hops|hop]] merchant in Southwark.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Times House of Commons 1911''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004, p29</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===1905\u20131910===\nStrauss was adopted as Liberal candidate for the [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern or Abingdon Division]] of [[Berkshire]] in February 1905. At that time he had an address in Abingdon.<ref>''The Times'', 17 February 1905 p10</ref> He gained the seat for the Liberals at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] but lost in [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]]. However he was soon adopted as Parliamentary candidate for [[Southwark West (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark West]]. [[Richard Causton, 1st Baron Southwark|Richard Causton]] had been Liberal MP for the constituency from 1888 to January 1910, when he lost to [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate William Henry Dunn. When Causton announced he did not intend to fight again Strauss replaced him and won the seat back from Dunn by the narrow margin of 18 votes, after a recount.<ref>''The Times'', 7 December 1910 p10</ref> At the time of this victory, Strauss was described as a hop merchant in Southwark who took a prominent interest in the work of the Hops Committee (a Parliamentary Select Committee which considered questions relating to hop growing, production and consumption).<ref>''The Times'', 11 July 1908 p14</ref> He was acknowledged as an authority on agricultural questions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and was particularly interested in the plight of [[Smallholding|smallholders]] and the promotion of their rights.<ref>''The Times'', 8 January 1910 p8 & 5 June 1911 p12</ref>\n\n===1910\u20131918===\nIn 1916, Strauss was a member of a deputation to the War Minister, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] to press for better defences against air raids on London.<ref>''The Times'', 28 January 1916 p8</ref>\n\nStrauss\u2019 West Southwark constituency was abolished for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and he stood instead for the new seat of [[Southwark North (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark North]]. He was designated a Coalition Liberal, standing in support of the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]] of [[David Lloyd George]]<ref>''The Times'', 26 November 1918 p4</ref> and had presumably been issued with the [[Coalition Coupon|Coalition coupon]] as he faced no official [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] opponent. However, there were apparently Unionist objections to his candidacy because Lieutenant-General Sir John Harrington was invited to stand by local Conservatives as an Independent Unionist. Harrington agreed on the understanding that he was to be regarded as completely independent of party. Harrington had previously been a member of the recently formed right-wing [[National Party (UK, 1917)|National Party]]. Also standing against Strauss was [[George Isaacs]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and Mr J J Gebbett, a representative of the [[National Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors]] or the [[Silver Badge Party]],<ref>''The Times'', 12 December 1918 p9</ref> an organisation which was later subsumed into the [[Royal British Legion]].  Strauss held the seat with a majority of 2,071 votes over Harrington with Isaacs third and Gebbett at the foot of the poll.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1919''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004 p22</ref>\n\n===1922\u20131924===\nStrauss stood at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] as a Lloyd George [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal]].  He was opposed in a straight fight with Labour by [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Dr Leslie Haden-Guest]], the secretary and doctor to the former Labour delegation to Soviet Russia in 1920 and a [[London County Council]]lor. The election took place against the backdrop of a set of poor local election results for Labour just two weeks before, when Labour lost all their councillors in Southwark.<ref>''The Times'', 3 November 1922 p15</ref>  Strauss held his seat with a majority of 1,112.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\">F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Elections Results 1918\u20131949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p49</ref>\n\nIn [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]] Strauss, now described as a plain Liberal without prefix of suffix, again faced a straight fight against Labour\u2019s Leslie Haden-Guest. This time, despite the reunion of the Lloyd George and [[H H Asquith|Asquithian]] Liberals, and the gains the Liberal Party made overall, Strauss was beaten, albeit by the narrow margin of 362 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 7 December 1923 p6</ref> At the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] Strauss tried to win his seat back, this time in a three-cornered contest with Haden-Guest and Mr J J Llewellin for the Conservatives. Despite what was reported as a strenuous effort to regain his seat, Strauss lost by 1,030 votes, the intervention of the Unionist (who polled 3,305 votes) probably helping to deprive him of victory.<ref>''The Times'', 18 October 1924 p6</ref>\n\n===By-election, 1927===\nStrauss was handed an unusual opportunity to re-enter Parliament in 1927 when Haden-Guest resigned from the Parliamentary Labour Party in protest against the party\u2019s opposition to government policy in China, which he believed placed British nationals in Shanghai at risk and was tantamount to an intervention in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Haden-Guest then chose to resign also from Parliament and cause a by-election in which he sought re-election. He obtained the support of the local Conservative Party in Southwark but stood as an Independent Constitutionalist. He was opposed by Strauss for the Liberals and George Isaacs for Labour. Haden-Guest may not have anticipated the Liberal intervention in the by-election which he wanted to contest as a straight fight between a socialist and an anti-socialist candidate. He had envisaged his by-election as a chance to ask working class voters in particular to choose his brand of \u2018patriotism\u2019 over the attitude of the Labour Party.<ref>''The Times'', 29 March 1927 p14</ref> In the event, Strauss profited from the split in the socialist vote<ref>[[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], ''Lloyd George: The Goat in the Wilderness, 1922\u20131931;'' Cape, 1977 p162</ref> gained the seat with a majority of 1,167 over Isaacs with Haden-Guest in third place with less than 20% of the poll.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\"/>\n\n===1929===\nAt the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] Strauss again faced George Isaacs as his Labour opponent, as well as a Conservative, Marcus Samuel. The election contest was obviously a bitter one as Strauss announced he was cancelling all his public meetings which he claimed were being systematically disrupted and speakers being howled down by Labour Party supporters.<ref>''The Times'', 28 May 1929 p9</ref> This time Isaacs won the seat, by the narrow margin of 432 votes \u2013 the intervention of the Conservative candidate again splitting the anti-Labour vote.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\"/>\n\n===Liberal National===\nIn 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] led by prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] supported by a small number of [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] MPs and initially backed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However most Liberals had concerns about supporting the National coalition over the long run because of the government\u2019s commitment to protectionism and tariffs in opposition to the traditional Liberal policy of [[Free Trade]].  Despite these worries, the Liberal Party led by Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] agreed to go into the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] supporting the government.  As a result, Strauss found himself the representative of the coalition against Labour in Southwark North at the election, Marcus Samuel having agreed to stand aside.<ref>''The Times'', 9 October 1931 p14</ref> This time, with no Conservative to split the anti-Labour vote and the great popularity of the National Government as a result of the economic crisis, Strauss won back the seat in a straight fight with Isaacs by a majority of 5,992 taking 65% of the poll.<ref name=\"S Craig, p49\"/>\n\nAs the initial crisis passed, the Liberal Party became increasingly anxious about the government\u2019s stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to give more open support to MacDonald\u2019s administration. Strauss was not one of the original members of this group but by 1932 he had become identified with it.<ref>''The Times'', 21 March 1932 p14</ref> By October 1932, Strauss was writing openly to Herbert Samuel expressing the view that the Liberal Party could not be revived by adopting the slogan \u2018Back to Free Trade\u2019 and that this policy was only one of a number of important issues which needed the government action.<ref>''The Times'', 6 October 1932 p7</ref>\n \nEven though he was by now 73 years of age, Strauss again stood for re-election in Southwark North as a [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National]] at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]]. Having been deprived of the seat by small majorities in the past, Strauss was this time the lucky one, squeaking home in another straight fight with Isaacs by just 79 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 16 November 1935 p18</ref> However his age and state of health told upon him and he decided to step down from Parliament at the next general election, though in fact he died before that election was held.<ref name=\"The Times, 16 March 1939 p13\">''The Times'', 16 March 1939 p13</ref>\n\n===Other public offices===\nStrauss served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for the counties of [[County of London|London]] and Berkshire.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> He was also appointed a Freeman and [[Livery Company|Liveryman]] of the [[City of London]]<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1919''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2004, p22</ref> and Warden of the [[Worshipful Company of Gardeners]].<ref>''The Times'', 11 July 1910 p12</ref> In 1925, Strauss was nominated as [[Sheriff]] of Berkshire.<ref>''The Times'', 13 November 1925 p22</ref>\n\n==Election promises court case==\nIn a case which, potentially, could have had far-reaching consequences for all democratically elected representatives, Strauss found himself in court in 1913 when one of his constituents, a Mr Arthur Macgillicuddy, brought an action against him to recover damages for alleged [[breach of contract]], i.e. that Strauss had failed to carry out the promises on which he had been elected an MP.

According to H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, disease was the single most dangerous threat to Native Americans. The Comanche managed to avoid disease, which gave them an upper hand over the Apaches and other tribes in this area. Along with this, the Comanche were able to exchange goods with Europeans, and Spaniards. The main thing exchanged for that gave them power was horses. Horses gave the Comanches more military power, and allowed them to hunt more buffalo.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Grass: European Expansion, Ecological Change, and Indigenous Power in the Southwest Boarderlands|last=H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen|first=Pekka|publisher=William and Mary Quarterly|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=173-208}}</ref> The Comanches used this military power to obtain more supplies and labor from the Americans, Mexicans, and Indians through thievery, tribute, and kidnappings. (See [[Comanche-Mexico War]]) Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In the early 1830s, the Comanche began to run out of resources in Comancher\u00eda. At this time, they had been conducting raids deep into Mexico and would take what they got back to Comancher\u00eda. In the mid 1830s, the Comanche formed a colony in Mexico called the Bolson colony. Conditions in this colony were similar to how they were in Comancher\u00eda when it was winter in the north. Eventually, there was a drought, and Comancher\u00eda and the Bolson colony struggled.<ref name=\":0\" /> Along with this, Comanche empire collapsed when their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera in the late 1840s; the population plunged from 20,000 to just a few thousand by the 1870s.<ref>H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2008), p. 2.</ref>\n\nThe Comanche resolved most of the challenges facing them in the 1830s with adroit diplomacy. Their strategy was flexible. With New Mexico, a Mexican province to their west, they enjoyed friendly trading relations. New Mexico was more of an asset than a threat to the Comanches and the New Mexicans avoided war with the Indians. In 1841 Governor [[Manuel Armijo]] was ordered by the Mexican central government to join a military campaign against the Comanche, but Armijo declined. \"To declare war on the Comanches would bring complete ruin to the Department of New Mexico.\" In 1844, New Mexican officials learned of but did nothing to prevent a Comanche raid on Chihuahua.<ref>Weber, p. 114\u2013115</ref> \n\nWith their western flank secured by an unthreatening New Mexico, the Comanche dealt with rivals on their northern and eastern borders. In 1835, they met with a delegation of U.S. soldiers and eastern Indians in the [[Wichita Mountains]] of Oklahoma and concluded a peace agreement. The agreement permitted eastern Indians and Anglo-Americans to hunt on Comanche lands and did not restrain the Comanche and their Kiowa and Wichita allies from making war on Mexico.<ref>Hoig, Stan, ''Beyond the Frontier: Exploring the Indian Country''. Norman: U of OK Press,1998, p. 185</ref> With their eastern flank secured by the treaty with the U.S., the Comanches next concluded a peace agreement in 1840 with the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho pressing on them from the north. It was highly favorable to the Cheyenne and Arapaho. They were permitted to reside and hunt on the buffalo and horse-rich Comanche lands and, in addition, the affluent Comanches gave them gifts, including as many as six horses to every Cheyenne and Arapaho man.<ref>DeLay, 80</ref> The Comanche welcome to these two tribes, their southern bands numbering perhaps 4,000, was both an acknowledgment that they were formidable rivals and also that the Comanche were short on men and resources to maintain their control over Comancher\u00eda.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nSouth and southeast of Comancher\u00eda were the fast-growing Anglo-American communities in the Mexican territory of Texas. In the 1820s and 1830s most Comanche raids were in the southern parts of Texas and affected the largely Hispanic population around [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]].<ref>Hamalainen, 198-199</ref> After the [[Texas Revolution]] asserting independence from Mexico in 1836, the Comanche had to deal with the new Republic of Texas.  Texas's first President, [[Sam Houston]], was knowledgeable about Indians and favored a policy of accommodation with the Comanche.\n\nContinued Comanche raids led to the election in 1838 of [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] who favored a more aggressive approach. The [[Council House Fight|massacre of 35 Comanche chiefs]] attending a peace conference in San Antonio in March 1840 set off a series of bloody reprisals and battles. Hundreds of Comanches descended upon and destroyed the towns of [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]] and [[Linnville, Calhoun County, Texas|Linnville]] in 1840 (see [[Great Raid of 1840]]). Although the Texans demonstrated they could defeat the Comanche (See [[Battle of Plum Creek]]), military campaigns emptied their treasury and Texas became more accommodating. (See [[Texas-Indian Wars]]) In 1844, the Texans and the Comanches came to an agreement which recognized Comanche lands and left Comancher\u00eda intact.<ref>Hamalainen, 228</ref>\n\nThe agreements with the United States and neighboring tribes, as well as the hiatus in the struggle with Texas, freed up the Comanche to make unrestrained war on the Mexican provinces south of the Rio Grande. The 1830s demonstrated that the Texans, the United States, and neighboring tribes all had the ability to invade Comancher\u00eda and attack the Comanche homeland; Mexico, by contrast, was rich in horses and unable to counterattack due to distance and the fact that, after 1836, any Mexican military expedition against Comanches would have had to pass through Texas, a republic whose independence Mexico did not recognize. In attacking Mexico, the Comanche seemed motivated by opportunity, economics and revenge \u2013 their animosity toward non-Comanches sharpened by decades of war and reprisals. Thus, their raids on Mexico became increasingly bloody and destructive.\n\n===Neighboring peoples===\nTo the west, southwest and southeast of the Comancher\u00eda stretched the vast territories of the various hostile [[Apache]] groups, partially overlapping and forming a kind of no man's land, which was heavily contested between the two peoples. Moreover, the Comanche had to pass through the dangerous [[Apacheria|Apacher\u00eda]] on their way down to Mexico for raiding and recross it with plunder. The Oklahoma and Texas panhandles were inhabited by their allies, the [[Kiowa]] and [[Kiowa-Apache]], along with the Comanche. In the northwest of the Comancher\u00eda lived the opposing [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] and [[Shoshone]], to the northeast settled the enemy and powerful [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and in the north the also antagonistic [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]. In addition, in and adjacent to the Comancheria settled the allied [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]], [[Tawakoni]], [[Waco tribe|Waco]] (Spanish: Hueco, were a subtribe of the Wichita) and [[Hasinai]]. In the East lived the [[Caddo]] and later the [[Cherokee]]. In the southeast settled the erstwhile allies, but after the expulsion of the Apaches of the Plains, now rival [[Tonkawa]]. In the north, the [[Southern Cheyenne]] and [[Southern Arapaho]], forced the Comanche to acknowledge the Arkansas River as their northern border. Moreover, the Comanche undertook extensive commercial enterprises to the [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] in New Mexico and to the Spanish settlements around [[San Antonio]], Texas. In this trade of guns, horses, captives and other goods the [[Comanchero]]s (Pueblo and New Mexico traders) acted as intermediaries. The [[Cibolero]]s also competed against the Comanche in the context of bison hunting.
