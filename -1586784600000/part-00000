By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'.

The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'.

The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

{"title_page": "Ulpan", "text_new": "{{For|the Scottish Gaelic education method|\u00d9lpan}}\n[[File:Ulpan 1955.jpg|thumb|Ulpan in [[Dimona]], 1955]]\n{{Aliyah}}\nAn '''ulpan''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05df}}) is an institute or school for the intensive study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Ulpan (plural '''ulpanim''' '{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd}}) is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning \"studio\", \"teaching\", or \"instruction\".\n\nThe ulpan is designed to teach adult [[olim|immigrants]] to [[Israel]] the basic language skills of conversation, writing and comprehension. Most ulpanim also provide instruction in the fundamentals of [[Israeli culture]], history, and geography. The primary purpose of the ulpan is to help new citizens to be integrated as quickly and as easily as possible into the social, cultural and economic life of their new country.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of the ulpan was initiated soon after the [[creation of Israel]] in 1948. The new country was faced with a massive influx of new immigrants, refugees from [[World War II|war-torn]] Europe, oppressed and disadvantaged communities from [[Africa]] and the Middle East, and others from all parts of the world. Their language and culture varied widely. The ulpan was created to help them learn the Hebrew language and assimilate into the culture.\n\nUlpan Etzion in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Baka, Jerusalem|Baka]] neighborhood was established in 1949 by Mordechai Kamerat as a model for Hebrew language education used across Israel. It was a residential facility for single [[Aliyah|olim]] between the ages 21 and 35 holding a bachelor's degree.

Ulpan (plural '''ulpanim''' '{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd}}) is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning \"studio\", \"teaching\", or \"instruction\".\n\nThe ulpan is designed to teach adult [[olim|immigrants]] to [[Israel]] the basic language skills of conversation, writing and comprehension. Most ulpanim also provide instruction in the fundamentals of [[Israeli culture]], history, and geography. The primary purpose of the ulpan is to help new citizens to be integrated as quickly and as easily as possible into the social, cultural and economic life of their new country.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of the ulpan was initiated soon after the [[creation of Israel]] in 1948. The new country was faced with a massive influx of new immigrants, refugees from [[World War II|war-torn]] Europe, oppressed and disadvantaged communities from [[Africa]] and the Middle East, and others from all parts of the world. Their language and culture varied widely. The ulpan was created to help them learn the Hebrew language and assimilate into the culture.\n\nUlpan Etzion in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Baka, Jerusalem|Baka]] neighborhood was established in 1949 by Mordechai Kamerat as a model for Hebrew language education used across Israel. It was a residential facility for single [[Aliyah|olim]] between the ages 21 and 35 holding a bachelor's degree.
