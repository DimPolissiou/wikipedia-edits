For states with primaries, some states choose to use the \"winner-take-all\" method to allocate delegates within a state, while others do winner-take-all within a specific congressional district, and still others use the proportional process. Unlike the Democratic Party, state party by-laws determine whether each delegate is pledged and for how long the delegate is pledged.\n\nIn caucus states, most state parties use a two pronged process. A [[straw poll]], often called a ''presidential preference poll'', is conducted of the attendees at the caucus. The results are released to the media and published on the state party website. Delegates are then elected to the county conventions. It is at the county conventions that delegates are elected to state conventions, and from the state convention to the national convention. At each level, delegates may be bound or unbound to a candidate. If unbound, delegates are not obligated to follow the results of the presidential preference poll. Thus, all estimates of delegates from caucus states are dependent on state party by-laws.\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Further|Republican Party (United States) presidential debates, 2008}}\n\n===2007===\nWith Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] choosing not to seek the nomination and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] ruling herself out, the race for the 2008 presidential nomination was wide open. It officially began in March 2006 when [[John H. Cox]] became the first candidate to enter the 2008 race. The Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and President Bush's unpopularity were strong issues for the GOP field. At the beginning of 2007, the announced Republican field was former [[Governor of Wisconsin]] and [[U.S. Cabinet|Cabinet]] member [[Tommy Thompson]], former Governor of Virginia [[Jim Gilmore]], and [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] of [[Kansas]] [[Sam Brownback]]. Former senator of [[Virginia]] [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] was considered a top contender until his loss in the midterm elections. He announced on December 10, 2006 that he would not seek the 2008 nomination. In early January former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Mitt Romney]] announced he was forming an exploratory committee. Afterwards several others announced they were running, including U.S.Congressman [[Ron Paul]], [[Mike Huckabee]] of Arkansas, [[Rudy Giuliani]] of New York City, U.S. Senator [[John McCain]], [[U.S. Congressman]] [[Duncan L. Hunter|Duncan Hunter]], and U.S. Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]]. A poll released in early February had Giuliani leading with 32% and [[John McCain]] second with 18%. By early March, Giuliani had become the frontrunner. [[Alan Keyes]] and former Senator and actor [[Fred Thompson]] entered the race later in September.\n\nThe first to drop out of the race was former Virginia Governor [[Jim Gilmore]] in July. After that [[Tommy Thompson]] also dropped out in August after finishing sixth in the Ames Iowa straw poll. Then pro-life advocate [[Sam Brownback]] dropped out of the race in October. In December, staunch illegal-immigration opponent [[Tom Tancredo]] and businessman [[John H. Cox]] also left the race.\n\n===Iowa and New Hampshire===\n[[Image:IowaCaucusRepublican2008.png|thumb|right|2008 Iowa Republican Caucus county Map{{legend|#3F5DCA|[[Mike Huckabee]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}\n{{legend|#DD5A5A|[[Mitt Romney]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}\n{{legend|#ECE07F|[[Ron Paul]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}]]\nOn January 3, 2008, the [[Iowa Caucus|Iowa caucuses]] began.

McCain had staked much on his grassroots efforts in the state he won in 2000, as well as the state with one of the most independent voting blocks which was McCain's strong suit. Romney, coming from neighboring [[Massachusetts]] was known by many in New Hampshire and even owned a home in the state of New Hampshire. Pre-Primary polling showed McCain with a slight edge (32\u201328%) with Huckabee leading Giuliani for third (12\u20139%).\n\nOn Primary night, McCain won 37\u201332% and Huckabee beat Giuliani for third 11\u20139%. After the results, Huckabee decided to focus on the South Carolina primary, while both McCain and Romney went to Michigan where polls showed a competitive race between the two.\n\n===Michigan===\nWith different winners in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 and Mitt Romney taking the lower-profile [[Wyoming Republican county conventions, 2008|Wyoming caucus]] \u2013 the January 15 Michigan primary loomed as an important battle.

President George W.

For states with primaries, some states choose to use the \"winner-take-all\" method to allocate delegates within a state, while others do winner-take-all within a specific congressional district, and still others use the proportional process. Unlike the Democratic Party, state party by-laws determine whether each delegate is pledged and for how long the delegate is pledged.\n\nIn caucus states, most state parties use a two pronged process. A [[straw poll]], often called a ''presidential preference poll'', is conducted of the attendees at the caucus. The results are released to the media and published on the state party website. Delegates are then elected to the county conventions. It is at the county conventions that delegates are elected to state conventions, and from the state convention to the national convention. At each level, delegates may be bound or unbound to a candidate. If unbound, delegates are not obligated to follow the results of the presidential preference poll. Thus, all estimates of delegates from caucus states are dependent on state party by-laws.\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Further|Republican Party (United States) presidential debates, 2008}}\n\n===2007===\nWith Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] choosing not to seek the nomination and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] ruling herself out, the race for the 2008 presidential nomination was wide open. It officially began in March 2006 when [[John H. Cox]] became the first candidate to enter the 2008 race. The Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and President Bush's unpopularity were strong issues for the GOP field. At the beginning of 2007, the announced Republican field was former [[Governor of Wisconsin]] and [[U.S. Cabinet|Cabinet]] member [[Tommy Thompson]], former Governor of Virginia [[Jim Gilmore]], and [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] of [[Kansas]] [[Sam Brownback]]. Former senator of [[Virginia]] [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] was considered a top contender until his loss in the midterm elections. He announced on December 10, 2006 that he would not seek the 2008 nomination. In early January former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Mitt Romney]] announced he was forming an exploratory committee. Afterwards several others announced they were running, including U.S.Congressman [[Ron Paul]], [[Mike Huckabee]] of Arkansas, [[Rudy Giuliani]] of New York City, U.S. Senator [[John McCain]], [[U.S. Congressman]] [[Duncan L. Hunter|Duncan Hunter]], and U.S. Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]]. A poll released in early February had Giuliani leading with 32% and [[John McCain]] second with 18%. By early March, Giuliani had become the frontrunner. [[Alan Keyes]] and former Senator and actor [[Fred Thompson]] entered the race later in September.\n\nThe first to drop out of the race was former Virginia Governor [[Jim Gilmore]] in July. After that [[Tommy Thompson]] also dropped out in August after finishing sixth in the Ames Iowa straw poll. Then pro-life advocate [[Sam Brownback]] dropped out of the race in October. In December, staunch illegal-immigration opponent [[Tom Tancredo]] and businessman [[John H. Cox]] also left the race.\n\n===Iowa and New Hampshire===\n[[Image:IowaCaucusRepublican2008.png|thumb|right|2008 Iowa Republican Caucus county Map{{legend|#3F5DCA|[[Mike Huckabee]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}\n{{legend|#DD5A5A|[[Mitt Romney]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}\n{{legend|#ECE07F|[[Ron Paul]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}]]\nOn January 3, 2008, the [[Iowa Caucus|Iowa caucuses]] began. The final averaged polling results from [[Real Clear Politics]] showed Mike Huckabee at 30%, Romney at 27%, McCain and Thompson tied at 12%, Paul at 7%, and Giuliani at 6%.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/ia/iowa_republican_caucus-207.html| title = RCP- Election 2008 Iowa Caucus}}</ref> Among those surveyed in Exit Polling data, 45% cited themselves as very conservative and voted for Huckabee 35% to Romney's 23% and Thompson's 22%.

Romney swept the eastern and western portions of the state and Paul took one southern county. The final results in Iowa were Huckabee with 34%, Romney with 25%, Thompson and McCain each with 13%, Paul with 10% and Giuliani with 4%.\n\n[[File:2008 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary - Results by municipality.svg|thumb|left|2008 New Hampshire Primary results by municipality.<hr>\n{{legend|#ce5c17|[[John McCain]]|border=1px #ffffff solid}}\n{{legend|#85bb65|[[Mitt Romney]]|border=1px #ffffff solid}}\n{{legend|#990000|[[Mike Huckabee]]|border=1px #ffffff solid}}\n{{legend|#003884|[[Rudy Guliani]]|border=1px #ffffff solid}}\n{{legend|#fed105|[[Ron Paul]]|border=1px #ffffff solid}}\n{{legend|#666666|Tie|border=1px #ffffff solid}}\n{{legend|#d0d0d0|No votes|border=1px #ffffff solid}}]]\n\nIn the New Hampshire Primary, both McCain and Romney had gambled much on the state. McCain had staked much on his grassroots efforts in the state he won in 2000, as well as the state with one of the most independent voting blocks which was McCain's strong suit. Romney, coming from neighboring [[Massachusetts]] was known by many in New Hampshire and even owned a home in the state of New Hampshire. Pre-Primary polling showed McCain with a slight edge (32\u201328%) with Huckabee leading Giuliani for third (12\u20139%).\n\nOn Primary night, McCain won 37\u201332% and Huckabee beat Giuliani for third 11\u20139%. After the results, Huckabee decided to focus on the South Carolina primary, while both McCain and Romney went to Michigan where polls showed a competitive race between the two.\n\n===Michigan===\nWith different winners in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 and Mitt Romney taking the lower-profile [[Wyoming Republican county conventions, 2008|Wyoming caucus]] \u2013 the January 15 Michigan primary loomed as an important battle.

He exceeded expectations, earning 51% of the vote with [[Ron Paul]] beating out John McCain for second. Romney campaigned hard in Nevada and did not campaign in South Carolina, while the other leading Republican candidates, [[John McCain]] and [[Mike Huckabee]], kept their focus on South Carolina. Nevada was not subject to the Republican party cutting in half the number of delegates the state can send to the national convention, and neither was South Carolina. However, Nevada had more delegates at stake than South Carolina. A win in Nevada extended Romney's lead in total delegates.

The Republican rules did not affect Iowa, Maine, Nevada and Louisiana, because those states did not technically choose their delegates until district or state conventions that occurred after February 5. The Iowa county and state conventions were held on March 15 and June 14, 2008 respectively. The Nevada state convention was held on April 26, 2008, but was suspended by party officials before delegates were elected. The Executive Board of the Nevada Republican Party met on July 25, 2008 and appointed all 34 delegates and 31 alternates. The Louisiana caucuses selected 105 state delegates to the state convention on February 16 in [[Baton Rouge]].\n\n===Super Tuesday===\nMany states moved the dates of their primaries or caucuses up to February 5 ([[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]]).
