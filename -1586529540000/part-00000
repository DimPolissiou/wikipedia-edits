Initially, Hamburg decided not to let him go as the Olympics was not an official FIFA tournament. After a dispute, Hamburg decided to release him under the condition that he returned after Belgium's first two group games. At the Beijing Olympics, Belgium's first game was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] where he was sent off in a 1\u20130 loss, and as a consequence his tournament was over as the red card would rule him out of Belgium's second group game. Due to the turn of events, Kompany decided against returning to Germany in hope of playing the last group game to help his country qualify for the knockout stages. Hamburg maintained their stance that he had to return, and the Belgian FA decided to release him. He later came on as a substitute in the opening game for Hamburg against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. The rocky relationship with Hamburg and Kompany is said to be a major factor in him transferring to Manchester City.\n\nIn November 2009, Kompany fell out with the Belgium manager [[Dick Advocaat]].  On the Monday before the friendly match with [[Qatar]] on 18 November 2009, Kompany received permission to attend the funeral of his grandmother as long as he returned to the team hotel before 6&nbsp;pm that evening.

Initially, Hamburg decided not to let him go as the Olympics was not an official FIFA tournament. After a dispute, Hamburg decided to release him under the condition that he returned after Belgium's first two group games. At the Beijing Olympics, Belgium's first game was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] where he was sent off in a 1\u20130 loss, and as a consequence his tournament was over as the red card would rule him out of Belgium's second group game. Due to the turn of events, Kompany decided against returning to Germany in hope of playing the last group game to help his country qualify for the knockout stages. Hamburg maintained their stance that he had to return, and the Belgian FA decided to release him. He later came on as a substitute in the opening game for Hamburg against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. The rocky relationship with Hamburg and Kompany is said to be a major factor in him transferring to Manchester City.\n\nIn November 2009, Kompany fell out with the Belgium manager [[Dick Advocaat]].  On the Monday before the friendly match with [[Qatar]] on 18 November 2009, Kompany received permission to attend the funeral of his grandmother as long as he returned to the team hotel before 6&nbsp;pm that evening. As it happened, he did not return until nearly midnight. Furious, Advocaat removed him from the squad altogether, although on 24 February 2010 he was recalled to the Belgium squad by Advocaat for the friendly against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Romelu Lukaku est officiellement Diable Rouge |url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/diables-rouges/article/301782/romelu-lukaku-est-officiellement-diable-rouge.html |language=French |newspaper=La Derni\u00e8re Heure |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clint Dempsey and Vincent Kompany exchange pennants USA vs Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Belgian captain Kompany swaps pennants with [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]' skipper [[Clint Dempsey]] in 2013]]\n\nOn 19 May 2010, Kompany scored a 90th-minute goal to give Belgium a 2\u20131 win over [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in a friendly.

It was the first ever official football competition in Albania run by the newly formed [[Albanian Football Association]], as the [[1911 Albanian Superliga|1911 Albanian Championship]] was not run by the AFA and is not yet recognised. The six original members were [[KS Elbasani|Urani]], [[Teuta Durr\u00ebs|Teuta]], [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]], [[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Bashkimi Shkodran]], [[KF Tirana|Sportklub Tirana]] and [[KS Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|Sportklub Vlora]] who agreed to play a ten-game format whereby each team would host each of their five rivals once with two points awarded for a win and one point awarded for a drawn game. The two teams with the most points at the end of the regular season of the competition would then enter a championship playoff where they would play each other twice and the champions would be crowned based on the aggregate score of the home and away ties, however this playoff was not actually played due to forfeit.\n\n[[KF Tirana|Sportklub Tirana]] were declared the inaugural champions of Albania following two technical victories over [[Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]] in the championship playoffs, taking their seasonal total to seven wins, four draws and one loss.\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Teams by locations===\n{{Location map+|Albania|float=right|width=350|caption=Location of teams in the '''Kategoria superiore 1930'''|places=\n{{Location map~|Albania|lat=42.066667 |long=19.5 |label=[[KS Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Bashkimi Shkodran]]}}\n{{Location map~|Albania|lat=40.625833 |long=20.782778|label=[[KS Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Albania|lat=41.316667 |long=19.45 |label=[[KS Teuta Durr\u00ebs|KF Teuta]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Albania|lat=41.326 |long=19.816 |label=[[KF Tirana|Sportklub Tirana]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Albania|lat=41.1 |long=20.066667 |label=[[KS Elbasani|Urani]]}}\n{{Location map~|Albania|lat=40.45 |long=19.483333 |label=[[KS Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|Sportklub Vlora]]|position=left}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Each team played each other twice during two phases, and the top two ranked teams entered the championship playoff which would have been a two-game playoff decided on the aggregate score for the championship title. Each win during the regular season was worth two points, with a  draw worth one point and a loss worth none. The first phase was held between 6 April and 4 May, and the second phase was held between 11 May and 22 June. The playoff finals were planned on 22 June and 6 July, but they did not take place due to Sk\u00ebnderbeu's forfeit of both games.\n\nThe playoff finals were not played following Sk\u00ebnderbeu's forfeit, which was a sign of protest against the bias of the competition and the [[Albanian Football Association]] towards the [[KF Tirana|Sportklub Tirana]]. Both games were awarded 2-0 to Sportklub Tirana thus crowning them the first champions of Albania.\n\n==League standings==\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|show_limit=5\n|update=complete\n|source=[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba34.html RSSSF]\n\n<!--Update team positions here-->\n|team1=TIR |team2=SK\u00cb |team3=BS |team4=TEU |team5=URA|team6=SV\n\n<!--Update team qualifications here (defined below)-->\n|result1=Q|result2=Q\n\n<!--Update team results here and then (if needed) positions above.

Plankton''' and '''Karen''' are fictional characters in the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. They are respectively voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and [[Jill Talley]]. Their first appearance was in the episode \"Plankton!\" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], the creator of the series, with additional character development by Lawrence.\n\nPlankton and Karen are the married owners of the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant. Plankton is an intellectual [[plankton]]ic [[copepod]] and Karen is a waterproof supercomputer. Plankton shares a rivalry with [[Mr. Krabs]], who owns the far more profitable [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the [[Krabby Patty]]. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.\n\nCritics have praised the characters\u2019 voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main [[antagonist]]s. The Planktons play central roles in the [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie|2004 theatrical film]], which promoted them both to main cast members in its credits, and the [[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water|2015 film]]. They have also been featured in a variety of spin-off media, including tie-in publications, playsets and other merchandise.\n\n==Plankton==\n===Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''===\n{{quote box|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=34em|style=max-width:40%\n|quote=[Plankton is a] complex, wounded character who is really looking for a friend in a way, but can't let that happen because of his evil front.

As a result, his restaurant is a commercial failure. Plankton's primary goal in the series is to put Krabs out of business and secure a [[monopoly]] on the fast food industry.

Outside of business, he seems to have a somewhat friendly relationship with SpongeBob. In ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'', Plankton discards his enmity for SpongeBob and works with him towards a common goal. The movie has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a \"buddy film\" between Plankton and SpongeBob.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water-first-look-review|title=The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water first look review \u2013 superhero slugfest drags a good sequel down|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last=Hoffman|first=Jordan|date=February 3, 2015}}</ref> Series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] considers Plankton \"more of a caricature of a villain\" than a truly evil character.<ref name=\"Beck102\"/>\n\n===Development===\nWhen ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' premiered, Plankton was not part of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, [[Mr. Lawrence]], has stated that after producing Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: \"We'll probably do another [Plankton episode] next year,\" <ref name=\"Beck111\"/> Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he \"was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character\".<ref name=\"courier\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138093814/|title=Meet the voice behind a 'SpongeBob' character|newspaper=[[Courier News]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|last=Bourbeau|first=Mary Ann|date=November 15, 2015}}</ref> Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 3)|third season]] the first in which Plankton is a main character.<ref name=\"Beck111\"/>\n\nDuring production on ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s early seasons, Lawrence was the only staff member writing premises and outlines involving Plankton. At the time, he felt he \"had to prove Plankton could survive as more than a one-note character\".<ref name=\"Beck105\"/> Since then, multiple writers have written for Plankton without Lawrence's involvement, including the teams of writers responsible for Plankton's starring roles in both ''SpongeBob'' films. Lawrence continues to write Plankton episodes, having said in 2015, \"I'm not just his voice. I get to create how the character is written and how he evolves over time.\"<ref name=\"courier\"/>\n\nPreliminary design sketches for Plankton depict him in a robotic suit, with Karen's system built into it; that suit does not appear in the series.<ref name=\"BoytoBob\">{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}</ref> The suit functioned as a way to increase Plankton's presence, as one of Hillenburg's original intentions was for the character to be too small to see without a magnifying glass.<ref name=\"Lawrence2015\">{{cite interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRuj3zHSwyE|title=Interview with Mr. Lawrence|last=Lawrence|first=Doug|subject-link=Mr. Lawrence|interviewer=Robert Dente|date=November 2015}}</ref> As the series progressed, the animators enlarged Plankton's size, feeling that being microscopic was \"not conducive to him interacting with other characters\".<ref name=\"Lawrence2015\"/>\n\n====Voice====\n[[File:Mr. Lawrence on Panel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mr. Lawrence]] (right) and [[Jill Talley]] (left), the voices of Plankton and Karen.]]\nPlankton's voice is provided by show writer and actor Doug Lawrence, normally credited as \"Mr. Lawrence\". The voice originated as an imitation of one of his deep-voiced high school friends.<ref name=\"courier\"/> On television, Lawrence first used this voice for incidental characters on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. Fellow voice actor [[Tom Kenny]] found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on ''SpongeBob''.<ref name=\"Beck105\"/> Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a more innocent voice for the character and turned him down.<ref name=\"courier\"/> Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the \"Plankton!\" episode.<ref name=\"courier\"/> He describes Plankton's voice as a \"combination of [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Tony the Tiger]].\"<ref name=\"Beck105\"/>\n\nWhen the \"Plankton!\" episode was pitched to [[Nickelodeon]], Hillenburg had already decided that he wanted Lawrence to play Plankton.

Plankton''' and '''Karen''' are fictional characters in the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. They are respectively voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and [[Jill Talley]]. Their first appearance was in the episode \"Plankton!\" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], the creator of the series, with additional character development by Lawrence.\n\nPlankton and Karen are the married owners of the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant. Plankton is an intellectual [[plankton]]ic [[copepod]] and Karen is a waterproof supercomputer. Plankton shares a rivalry with [[Mr. Krabs]], who owns the far more profitable [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the [[Krabby Patty]]. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.\n\nCritics have praised the characters\u2019 voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main [[antagonist]]s. The Planktons play central roles in the [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie|2004 theatrical film]], which promoted them both to main cast members in its credits, and the [[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water|2015 film]]. They have also been featured in a variety of spin-off media, including tie-in publications, playsets and other merchandise.\n\n==Plankton==\n===Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''===\n{{quote box|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=34em|style=max-width:40%\n|quote=[Plankton is a] complex, wounded character who is really looking for a friend in a way, but can't let that happen because of his evil front.

Outside of business, he seems to have a somewhat friendly relationship with SpongeBob.

The movie has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a \"buddy film\" between Plankton and SpongeBob.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water-first-look-review|title=The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water first look review \u2013 superhero slugfest drags a good sequel down|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last=Hoffman|first=Jordan|date=February 3, 2015}}</ref> Series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] considers Plankton \"more of a caricature of a villain\" than a truly evil character.<ref name=\"Beck102\"/>\n\n===Development===\nWhen ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' premiered, Plankton was not part of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, [[Mr. Lawrence]], has stated that after producing Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: \"We'll probably do another [Plankton episode] next year,\" <ref name=\"Beck111\"/> Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he \"was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character\".<ref name=\"courier\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138093814/|title=Meet the voice behind a 'SpongeBob' character|newspaper=[[Courier News]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|last=Bourbeau|first=Mary Ann|date=November 15, 2015}}</ref> Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg.

Lawrence considers the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 3)|third season]] the first in which Plankton is a main character.<ref name=\"Beck111\"/>\n\nDuring production on ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s early seasons, Lawrence was the only staff member writing premises and outlines involving Plankton. At the time, he felt he \"had to prove Plankton could survive as more than a one-note character\".<ref name=\"Beck105\"/> Since then, multiple writers have written for Plankton without Lawrence's involvement, including the teams of writers responsible for Plankton's starring roles in both ''SpongeBob'' films. Lawrence continues to write Plankton episodes, having said in 2015, \"I'm not just his voice. I get to create how the character is written and how he evolves over time.\"<ref name=\"courier\"/>\n\nPreliminary design sketches for Plankton depict him in a robotic suit, with Karen's system built into it; that suit does not appear in the series.<ref name=\"BoytoBob\">{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}</ref> The suit functioned as a way to increase Plankton's presence, as one of Hillenburg's original intentions was for the character to be too small to see without a magnifying glass.<ref name=\"Lawrence2015\">{{cite interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRuj3zHSwyE|title=Interview with Mr. Lawrence|last=Lawrence|first=Doug|subject-link=Mr. Lawrence|interviewer=Robert Dente|date=November 2015}}</ref> As the series progressed, the animators enlarged Plankton's size, feeling that being microscopic was \"not conducive to him interacting with other characters\".<ref name=\"Lawrence2015\"/>\n\n====Voice====\n[[File:Mr. Lawrence on Panel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mr. Lawrence]] (right) and [[Jill Talley]] (left), the voices of Plankton and Karen.]]\nPlankton's voice is provided by show writer and actor Doug Lawrence, normally credited as \"Mr. Lawrence\". The voice originated as an imitation of one of his deep-voiced high school friends.<ref name=\"courier\"/> On television, Lawrence first used this voice for incidental characters on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. Fellow voice actor [[Tom Kenny]] found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on ''SpongeBob''.<ref name=\"Beck105\"/> Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a more innocent voice for the character and turned him down.<ref name=\"courier\"/> Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the \"Plankton!\" episode.<ref name=\"courier\"/> He describes Plankton's voice as a \"combination of [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Tony the Tiger]].\"<ref name=\"Beck105\"/>\n\nWhen the \"Plankton!\" episode was pitched to [[Nickelodeon]], Hillenburg had already decided that he wanted Lawrence to play Plankton.

Foy, in his book ''SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy''. He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the program, writing that \"the motif of the nagging wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Mr. Krabs#Pearl|Pearl]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and the stupid best friend <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Patrick Star|Patrick]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>\".<ref name=\"Foy67\"/>\n\nLampooning a [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)#Criticism and controversy|controversy surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality]], essayist Dennis Hans wrote a 2005 satirical piece for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' focusing on the marriage of Plankton and Karen.
