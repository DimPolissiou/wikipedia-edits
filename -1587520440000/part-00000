A library Board was appointed. Post war years saw an expansion of Euclid's population, and as each new school was built, EPL established a branch in the school. By 1958 we had 12 branches which pointed out the need for a main library. The library Board was able to save enough money in a building fund to build a library on the present East 222nd Street site at a cost of nearly $300,000. That original building remains part of the library today.\nAvis Lane was the original library director and served from September 1940 to September 1966.\n\nAs Euclid's population grew so did library usage, and by 1964 the need for a larger library was apparent. Expansion funds were approved by Euclid voters, and a new addition that tripled the size of the original building was completed in 1966. In 1985 the building was remodeled and updated once again to make better use of existing space. This enabled the addition of space for small discussion groups, preschool story hours, technological advancements, and accessibility for the disabled.\n\nEuclid Public Library became a [[CLEVNET]] member in 1984. In the next ten years library circulation doubled. Audiovisual collections grew from zero to more than 12,000 items. Meeting rooms were filled to capacity. Through a strategic planning process, the community expressed its desire for a technology center, more space for children's and young adult services, a designated area for an African-American collection, better accessibility for the disabled, and more meeting rooms.\n\nIn 1995 the residents of Euclid recognized these needs by approving a bond issue for construction of an expanded facility to house these services. That facility is now a reality with 48,000 square feet on the original site.\n\nThe library went through a total remodel of the interior to refocus the public space in 2013.\n\n== Library Directors ==\n\n* Avis Lane - September 1940 - May 1966.\n* Joseph Bana - May 1966 to December 1985. \n* Judith Coleman - January 1986 to March 1989. \n* Dan Siebersma - September 1989 to May 1992. \n* Donna Perdzock -  May 1992 to December 2012. \n* Kacie Armstrong - January 2013 to present.\n\n== Services ==\n\nEuclid Public Library offers the following services to patrons:<ref>[https://www.euclidlibrary.org/services Euclid Public Library - Services].

It is the second film to be based on the popular [[children's television series]] ''[[Sesame Street]]'', after ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird]]'' (1985), the film stars [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Vanessa Williams]] alongside [[The Muppets|Muppet]] performers [[Kevin Clash]], [[Jerry Nelson]], [[Frank Oz]], and [[Steve Whitmire]].\n\nProduced by [[Jim Henson Pictures]] and the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on October 1, 1999.<ref name=AFI /> This film is one of the few ''Sesame Street'' productions directly produced by [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Alongside ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (which was released the same year), this is the final Muppet feature film to have the involvement of Oz, who retired from being a full-time puppeteer the following year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=How Kermit and the Muppets Got Their Mojo Back|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/the-muppets-talk-about-comebacks-and-their-relationship-with-disney-1201128921/|accessdate=26 July 2018|newspaper=Variety|date=11 March 2014}}</ref> This was also the final theatrical film to feature [[Caroll Spinney]] before his death 20 years later in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ernie and Bert]] introduce the film, and [[Elmo]] welcomes the viewer, finds his blanket and plays with it in his bedroom. He spills juice on his blanket and takes it to the laundromat where he encounters his friend [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]]. Elmo refuses to share his blanket resulting in a tug of war that rips it. Elmo declares that Zoe is no longer his friend.\n\n[[Telly Monster]], rollerskating out of control, accidentally swipes the blanket leading to a chase around Sesame Street. The blanket falls into the hands of [[Oscar the Grouch]], who drops it in his [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar The Grouch\u2019s Trash Can|trash can]]. Elmo dives into the bottom of Oscar's can, where he finds his blanket snagged on a door.\n\nAttempting to retrieve it, he and his blanket are teleported through a colorful swirling tunnel to Grouchland, a city filled with Grouches, garbage, and Huxley, a greedy man who steals anything he can grab, including Elmo's blanket. A kind Grouch girl named Grizzy tells Elmo that his blanket is in Huxley's house at the top of the faraway Mount Pickanose. A plant named Stuckweed encourages Elmo that he will make it if he just takes his first step, so Elmo sets out on a quest to retrieve his blanket.\n\nWith Oscar's help the Sesame Street residents go to Grouchland to find him. They ask a Grouch police officer for help but are arrested and imprisoned.\n\nHuxley has his sidekick, Bug the bug and his minions, the Pesties, trap Elmo in a tunnel. Elmo gets out with the help of fireflies. Huxley then has Bug and the Pesties misdirect Elmo into a garbage dump where he is brought before the Queen of Trash for trespassing. The Queen tests him, requesting that he blow 100 raspberries for her in 30 seconds.\n\nElmo succeeds with the help of the audience and the Queen allows him to pass through. Huxley sends his huge chicken to stop Elmo, who tosses Elmo far away. Elmo gives up on retrieving his blanket for the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Grizzy sneaks into the jail where she informs Elmo's friends that he went to Huxley's house. Oscar convinces all of the Grouches to cooperate, as it is the only way they can stop Huxley from stealing any more of their trash. The police officer releases the Sesame Street residents and the Grouches aid them into the night to go to Huxley's house to fight for their trash and rescue Elmo.\n\nA caterpillar wakes Elmo the next morning. He convinces Elmo that he has what it takes to be brave. Elmo  arrives at Huxley's house as Huxley sends the Pesties to stop him. The Sesame Street and Grouchland citizens arrive and the Pesties flee in panic.\n\nHuxley sucks up Elmo's blanket with the vacuum cleaner nozzle on his helicopter. Elmo launches a basket over Huxley's shoulders, incapacitating him. Bug is at the controls of the helicopter and refuses Huxley's demand for it back as he is sympathetic to Elmo and instead gives it back to him.\n\nElmo returns to Sesame Street with his friends, where he apologizes to Zoe and allows her to hold his blanket. She accepts his apology, agreeing that they can resume their friendship. Elmo says goodbye to the audience and thanks them for helping and goes to dance with his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n===Muppet performers===\n{{main|List of Sesame Street Muppets}}\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Kevin Clash]] as [[Elmo]], Pestie #1, Grouch Taxicab Driver, Grouch Jailer\n*[[Fran Brill]] as [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], [[Prairie Dawn]], Pestie #4\n*[[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] as Grizzy, Pestie #5\n*[[Dave Goelz]] as Humongous Chicken, Mouse\n*[[Joey Mazzarino|Joseph Mazzarino]] as Bug\n*[[Jerry Nelson]] as [[Count von Count]], Grouch Cop, [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]], Grouch Mayor, Pestie #2\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Carmen Osbahr]] as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]]\n*[[Martin P.

The regular puppets were used for the normal Sesame Street characters, and puppets for assorted Grouches (including Grizzy) were designed and built by Mark Zezsotek, who also built the puppets for Bug and the Pesties. [[Sonia Manzano]] reprised her role as Maria and [[Roscoe Orman]] reprised his role as Gordon. [[Vanessa Williams]] was cast as the Queen of Trash and the hairstylist colored her hair green for the role. [[Mandy Patinkin]] was a last-minute replacement for the original actor hired to play Huxley. For the role, the makeup artist designed false [[eyebrows]] for Patinkin to wear to make him seem like he had bushier eyebrows than normal.\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot over a 30-day period (starting May 26, 1998) at the [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studio in Wilmington along with ''[[Muppets from Space]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|archivedate=1999-11-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991129011234/http://www.elmoingrouchland.com/frame_story.html|title=Story|url=http://www.elmoingrouchland.com/frame_story.html|website=The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland|date=|url-status=unfit|via=web.archive.org}}</ref> The set was raised so that puppeteers would be able to stand up instead of squatting below street level like usual.

It is the second film to be based on the popular [[children's television series]] ''[[Sesame Street]]'', after ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird]]'' (1985), the film stars [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Vanessa Williams]] alongside [[The Muppets|Muppet]] performers [[Kevin Clash]], [[Jerry Nelson]], [[Frank Oz]], and [[Steve Whitmire]].\n\nProduced by [[Jim Henson Pictures]] and the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on October 1, 1999.<ref name=AFI /> This film is one of the few ''Sesame Street'' productions directly produced by [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Alongside ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (which was released the same year), this is the final Muppet feature film to have the involvement of Oz, who retired from being a full-time puppeteer the following year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=How Kermit and the Muppets Got Their Mojo Back|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/the-muppets-talk-about-comebacks-and-their-relationship-with-disney-1201128921/|accessdate=26 July 2018|newspaper=Variety|date=11 March 2014}}</ref> This was also the final theatrical film to feature [[Caroll Spinney]] before his death 20 years later in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ernie and Bert]] introduce the film, and [[Elmo]] welcomes the viewer, finds his blanket and plays with it in his bedroom. He spills juice on his blanket and takes it to the laundromat where he encounters his friend [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]]. Elmo refuses to share his blanket resulting in a tug of war that rips it. Elmo declares that Zoe is no longer his friend.\n\n[[Telly Monster]], rollerskating out of control, accidentally swipes the blanket leading to a chase around Sesame Street. The blanket falls into the hands of [[Oscar the Grouch]], who drops it in his [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar the Grouch\u2019s Trash Can|trash can]]. Elmo dives into the bottom of Oscar's can, where he finds his blanket snagged on a door.\n\nAttempting to retrieve it, he and his blanket are teleported through a colorful swirling tunnel to Grouchland, a city filled with Grouches, garbage, and Huxley, a greedy man who steals anything he can grab, including Elmo's blanket. A kind Grouch girl named Grizzy tells Elmo that his blanket is in Huxley's house at the top of the faraway Mount Pickanose. A plant named Stuckweed encourages Elmo that he will make it if he just takes his first step, so Elmo sets out on a quest to retrieve his blanket.\n\nWith Oscar's help the Sesame Street residents go to Grouchland to find him. They ask a Grouch police officer for help but are arrested and imprisoned.\n\nHuxley has his sidekick, Bug the bug and his minions, the Pesties, trap Elmo in a tunnel. Elmo gets out with the help of fireflies. Huxley then has Bug and the Pesties misdirect Elmo into a garbage dump where he is brought before the Queen of Trash for trespassing. The Queen tests him, requesting that he blow 100 raspberries for her in 30 seconds.\n\nElmo succeeds with the help of the audience and the Queen allows him to pass through. Huxley sends his huge chicken to stop Elmo, who tosses Elmo far away. Elmo gives up on retrieving his blanket for the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Grizzy sneaks into the jail where she informs Elmo's friends that he went to Huxley's house. Oscar convinces all of the Grouches to cooperate, as it is the only way they can stop Huxley from stealing any more of their trash. The police officer releases the Sesame Street residents and the Grouches aid them into the night to go to Huxley's house to fight for their trash and rescue Elmo.\n\nA caterpillar wakes Elmo the next morning. He convinces Elmo that he has what it takes to be brave. Elmo  arrives at Huxley's house as Huxley sends the Pesties to stop him. The Sesame Street and Grouchland citizens arrive and the Pesties flee in panic.\n\nHuxley sucks up Elmo's blanket with the vacuum cleaner nozzle on his helicopter. Elmo launches a basket over Huxley's shoulders, incapacitating him. Bug is at the controls of the helicopter and refuses Huxley's demand for it back as he is sympathetic to Elmo and instead gives it back to him.\n\nElmo returns to Sesame Street with his friends, where he apologizes to Zoe and allows her to hold his blanket. She accepts his apology, agreeing that they can resume their friendship. Elmo says goodbye to the audience and thanks them for helping and goes to dance with his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n===Muppet performers===\n{{main|List of Sesame Street Muppets}}\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Kevin Clash]] as [[Elmo]], Pestie #1, Grouch Taxicab Driver, Grouch Jailer\n*[[Fran Brill]] as [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], [[Prairie Dawn]], Pestie #4\n*[[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] as Grizzy, Pestie #5\n*[[Dave Goelz]] as Humongous Chicken, Mouse\n*[[Joey Mazzarino|Joseph Mazzarino]] as Bug\n*[[Jerry Nelson]] as [[Count von Count]], Grouch Cop, [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]], Grouch Mayor, Pestie #2\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Carmen Osbahr]] as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]]\n*[[Martin P.
