He was alleged to be the fifth member of the [[Cambridge Five]].<ref>{{cite journal  |last=Barnes  |first=Julian E.  |title=Spy Stories: The Third Man |journal=U.S. News & World Report |page=46 |date=27 January 2003}}</ref> He is also notable as a translator and writer of non-fiction.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nCairncross' father was the manager of an [[Ironmongery|ironmongery]] and his mother a primary school teacher. John Cairncross was one of a family of eight, many of whom had distinguished careers. All three of his brothers became professors. One was the economist [[Alexander Cairncross (economist)|Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross]] (a.k.a. Alec Cairncross). The journalist [[Frances Cairncross]] is his niece. Cairncross grew up in [[Lesmahagow]], a small town on the edge of moorland, near [[Lanark]] in the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]], and was educated at the [[Hamilton Academy]] (although his name appears as the 1928 winner of the Dux prize at Lesmahagow High School); the [[University of Glasgow]]; [[University of Paris|the Sorbonne]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied French and German.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/60115364.html?dids=60115364:60115364&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+13%2C+1998&author=&pub=The+Herald&desc=Plea+over+Scots+spy&pqatl=google] Scottish News Archive, The Herald, Glasgow, article 13 January 1998, ''Plea over Scots Spy'' \u2013 John Cairncross, \"a former pupil of Hamilton Academy\".

An article in the ''Glasgow Herald'' on 29 September 1936 noted that Cairncross had scored an \"outstanding double success of being placed 1st in the Home List and 1st in the competition for the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service,\" and that he had been placed fifth in the (Glasgow University) bursary competition of 1930, and was also a Scholar and Bell Exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'', 29 September 1936.</ref>\n\nCairncross worked initially in the Cabinet Office as a private secretary to [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Lord Hankey]], the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. Later he transferred to the [[British Foreign Office|Foreign Office]]. It has been suggested that in 1937, Cairncross joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|CPGB]], but he was not noted whilst at Cambridge for any political activity. He was regarded as rather austere and uncommunicative as an undergraduate.\n\n== Second World War ==\nIn 1942 and 1943 Cairncross worked in [[Government Code and Cypher School|GC&CS]], [[Bletchley Park]] on [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] [[cipher]]s.

In addition to German [[Abwehr]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], [[Luftwaffe]], naval, railway, [[Army group]] and [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]] messages, GC&CS intercepted and decrypted [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] communications with [[Comintern]] and with the [[Soviet Union]]. Cairncross first in [[Hut 3]], then later at [[MI6]] HQ, had access to raw decrypts.

In 1944, Cairncross joined MI6, the foreign intelligence service. In Section V, the [[counter-intelligence]] section, Cairncross produced under the direction of [[Kim Philby]] an [[order of battle]] of the SS. Cairncross later suggested that he was unaware of Philby's connections with the Russians. In October 1944, he wrote to his Soviet leaders in foreign intelligence that \"I am delighted that our friends found my help worthy of attention, and I am proud that I contributed something to the victory, which led to the almost complete cleansing of the Soviet land from the invaders\".<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In March 1945, he was awarded a \u00a3 1,000 per year pension but he refused to accept it.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\n[[Yuri Modin]], the Russian MGB (later KGB) Controller in London claims that Cairncross gave him details of nuclear arms to be stationed with [[NATO]] in West Germany.

Martin also received a denunciation which led to Blunt's confession. Despite his confession to Martin, Cairncross was never prosecuted for his espionage activities.

In December 1979, [[Barrie Penrose]], a journalist, concluded that Cairncross was the \"fifth man\" and confronted him. Cairncross' third confession became front-page news. In 1981, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] informed parliament that Cairncross was a Soviet agent and was living with his wife in the west of England while he wrote his memoirs.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> His status as the \"fifth man\" was supported years later by [[Oleg Gordievsky]], the KGB defector.

John Cairncross was one of a family of eight, many of whom had distinguished careers. All three of his brothers became professors. One was the economist [[Alexander Cairncross (economist)|Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross]] (a.k.a. Alec Cairncross). The journalist [[Frances Cairncross]] is his niece. Cairncross grew up in [[Lesmahagow]], a small town on the edge of moorland, near [[Lanark]] in the [[Central Belt]] of [[Scotland]], and was educated at the [[Hamilton Academy]] (although his name appears as the 1928 winner of the Dux prize at Lesmahagow High School); the [[University of Glasgow]]; [[University of Paris|the Sorbonne]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied French and German.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/60115364.html?dids=60115364:60115364&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+13%2C+1998&author=&pub=The+Herald&desc=Plea+over+Scots+spy&pqatl=google] Scottish News Archive, The Herald, Glasgow, article 13 January 1998, ''Plea over Scots Spy'' \u2013 John Cairncross, \"a former pupil of Hamilton Academy\".

In October 1944, he wrote to his Soviet leaders in foreign intelligence that \"I am delighted that our friends found my help worthy of attention, and I am proud that I contributed something to the victory, which led to the almost complete cleansing of the Soviet land from the invaders\".<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In March 1945, he was awarded a \u00a3 1,000 per year pension but he refused to accept it.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\n[[Yuri Modin]], the Russian MGB (later KGB) Controller in London claims that Cairncross gave him details of nuclear arms to be stationed with [[NATO]] in West Germany. He gives no date for this message.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} But Cairncross was at the [[Ministry of Supply]] in 1951 and NATO was established in April 1949. However, there was no such plan at this time and it was only much later that NATO obtained tactical nuclear weapons under US control in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This appears to have been a [[disinformation]] exercise.<ref name=\"Modin\">S.J.Hamrick (W.T.Tyler) ''Deceiving the Deceivers)'' ; Yale University Press, New Haven and London 2004.</ref>\n\nIn September 1951, he was questioned by British counterintelligence about his relationship with Maclean and the Communist Party.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross had been trained by the Soviets on how to behave during a counterintelligence interrogation.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> On 23 October 1951, Cairncross informed his Soviet controller that he had merely explained to the interrogator that he did not hide his membership with the party and that he would merely greet Maclean when he worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but did not maintain any contact with Maclean after graduation.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> For security, the residence temporarily stopped contact with him, allowed him to continue to report monthly his situation with appropriate signals, and planned a follow up meeting on 23 January 1952.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> The Soviets developed an exfiltration plan for Cairncross including funds, documents, and communication methods while living in other countries.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> However, Cairncross did not signal his controller until an early March 1952 meeting during which Cairncross stated that he had been interrogated again.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> The residency did not have any more contact with Cairncross and instructed [[Kim Philby]] to determine Cairncross's whereabouts.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Philby could not determine the whereabouts of Cairncross.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross admitted to spying in 1951 after [[MI5]] found papers in [[Guy Burgess]]'s flat with a handwritten note from him, after Burgess's flight to Moscow. Philby had also informed the residency of this.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\nSome believe that he may have supplied information about the Western [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] programme, the [[Manhattan Project]], to assist the Soviet nuclear programme.<ref name=mitrokhin>Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, ''The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West'', London, Penguin Books, 2000. note 13, p. 150</ref> It would have been surprising, though, if he had clearance to any useful engineering information, or that he would have understood it. He was never prosecuted which later led to charges that the government engaged in a conspiracy to [[cover up]] his role.

Although he knew [[Anthony Blunt]] at Cambridge and Guy Burgess in the Foreign Office, and had a dislike of both of them, he claimed not to have been aware that they or any of the others were also passing secrets to the Russians.\n\n==Later life==\nAt the end of the war Cairncross joined the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] \u2013 he claimed that he ceased working for the [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] (later to become the [[KGB]]), at this time. KGB reports, published subsequently, contradict this.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\nAfter his first confession (1952), Cairncross lost his civil-service job and was penniless and unemployed. He moved to the United States as a lecturer at [[Northwestern University]] and at [[Case Western Reserve University]].<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Cairncross |authorlink=John Cairncross |year=1997 |title=The Enigma Spy}}</ref> Caincross became an expert on French authors and translated the works of many 17th century French poets and dramatists such as [[Jean Racine]], [[Jean de La Fontaine]] and [[Pierre Corneille]], as well as writing three of his own books: ''Moli\u00e8re bourgeois et libertin''; ''New Light on Moli\u00e8re''; and ''After Polygamy was Made a Sin''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cairncross |first=Alec |editor-first=John|editor-last=Cairncross |title=The Enigma Spy|publisher=Century |year=1997 |pages=100\u2013110 |chapter=Preface |isbn=9780712678841}}</ref>\n\nThis career was ended following further investigation into Cairncross by MI5 investigative officer [[Arthur S. Martin]]. After Philby fled to [[Moscow]] in 1963, Martin reopened the files to hunt for the fourth and fifth men in 1964.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> To Martin's surprise, Cairncross made a full confession. Martin also received a denunciation which led to Blunt's confession. Despite his confession to Martin, Cairncross was never prosecuted for his espionage activities. The confession, conducted in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], was not made within British jurisdiction or under caution and would therefore have been inadmissable in court.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Davenport-Hines |title=Enemies Within |year=2018 |page=546}}</ref> After the counterintelligence proceedings were completed, he was allowed to travel abroad and moved to Canada where he worked as a teacher.<ref name=Yermakov61998/>\n\nIn 1967,<ref name=Yermakov61998/> Cairncross moved to [[Rome]], where he worked for the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] as a translator, also taking on work for the Research Office of [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]] (BNL), [[Banca d'Italia]] and IMI. In 1970, he moved to France and lived in Provence.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> In the BNL, a young economist engaged with international scenarios analysis (the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] of 1980\u20131988, petroleum's strategic routes in the Middle East and Far East) reported a strong and unusual interest by Cairncross about the bank's role in that area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During his time in Rome, his secret finally reached the public. In December 1979, [[Barrie Penrose]], a journalist, concluded that Cairncross was the \"fifth man\" and confronted him. Cairncross' third confession became front-page news. In 1981, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] informed parliament that Cairncross was a Soviet agent and iwa living with his wife in the west of England while he wrote his memoirs.<ref name=Yermakov61998/> His status as the \"fifth man\" was supported years later by [[Oleg Gordievsky]], the KGB defector. Cairncross retired to the south of France until 1995 when he returned to Britain and married American opera singer [[Gayle Brinkerhoff]]. Later that year he died after suffering a stroke, at the age of 82.<ref name=Independent10101995>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-john-cairncross-1576877.html |title=Obituary, John Cairncross |work=[[The Independent]] |last=Bower |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Bower |date=10 October 1995 |access-date=15 November 2010 |archive-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115140256/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-john-cairncross-1576877.html}}</ref>\n\nCairncross' autobiography, ''The Enigma Spy'', was published in 1997.

[[Anthony Blunt]] is depicted in the drama as pressuring him with threats. \n\nCairncross appears as a character in the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic]] ''India Dreams'' by Maryse and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Charles. He is depicted as the fifth of the Cambridge Five in [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Deceiver (novel)|The Deceiver]]''.\n\nCairncross appears as a [[cryptography|cryptographer]] at Bletchley Park in the 2014 film ''[[The Imitation Game]],'' played by [[Allen Leech]]. He is shown as an unwitting double agent being used as a back-channel by MI6 to pass information to the Soviets that Churchill is too cautious to provide; no historical basis for this is provided.\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his successfully obtaining information about German plans and operations on the Soviet-German front during World War II\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Written===\n*''New Light on Moli\u00e8re: Tartuffe, Elomire Hypocondre'' (Librairie Droz, 1956)\n*''Moli\u00e8re bourgeois et libertin'' (Nizet, 1963)\n*''After Polygamy Was Made a Sin: The Social History of Christian Polygamy'' (Routledge, 1974)\n*''Things to come: the world food crisis, the way out'' (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 1974).\n*''An Approach to Food and Population Planning'' (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 1978)\n*''Population and Agriculture in the Developing Countries'' (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 1980).\n*''La Fontaine Fables, And Other Poems'' (Colin Smythe, 1982)\n*''L'Humanit\u00e9 de Moli\u00e8re'' (Nizet, 1988)\n*''The Enigma Spy: An Autobiography'' (Century, 1997)\n\n===Translated===\n*''Iphigenia; Phaedra; Athaliah'' (Racine, Penguin Classics, 1963)\n*''Andromache; Britannicus; Berenice'' (Racine, Penguin Classics, 1967)\n*''The Cid, Cinna, The Theatrical Illusion'' (Corneille, Penguin Classics, 1975)\n*''Polyeuctus, The Liar, The Nicomedes'' (Corneille, Penguin Classics, 1980)\n*''La Fontaine Fables and Other Poems'' (La Fontaine, Colin Smythe, 1982)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cambridge Five]]\n*[[Anthony Blunt]] (1907\u20131983)\n*[[Guy Burgess]] (1911\u20131963)\n*[[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] (1913\u20131983)\n*[[Kim Philby]] (1912\u20131988)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web  | title =The Cambridge spy ring | work =BBC News | date =13 September 1999 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/09/99/britain_betrayed/444058.stm\n  | accessdate =5 March 2007}}\n* {{cite web  | last =Clark   | first =J.
