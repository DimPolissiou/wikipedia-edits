''Missions'' is further broken down into 2 modes: ''Campaign'' and ''Time Trials''. The main gameplay occurs during ''Campaign''. In ''Campaign'', the player uses sliders and dials on the touchscreen to manoeuver a submarine through side-scrolling levels displayed on the top screen, sinking enemy submarines, [[battleship]]s and avoiding [[naval mine]]s and [[depth charge]]s as required. There are seven missions available, playable with different subs and difficulty modes, which usually involve goals such as eliminating enemy fleets or infiltrating enemy bases by reaching the goal in a time limit. ''Time Trials'' features the same gameplay style and controls, however the levels are shorter and are not connected to the story, instead being solely to achieve a fast time through a complex path. ''Periscope Strike'' mode is played after every successful mission or can also be played separately, or as part of ''Steel Commander''. This mode sees the player moving the system to rotate a [[periscope]] to fire torpedoes at enemy ships. ''Steel Commander'' is playable against the CPU or a human opponent via Download Play.

Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called [[Concangis]]. This Roman fort is the \"Chester\" (from the Latin ''[[castra]]'') of the town's name; the \"Street\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north\u2013south through the town, and which is now called Front Street.\n\nChester-le-Street is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} west of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]]. The parish church of [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Mary and St Cuthbert]] is where the body of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] remained for 112 years before being transferred to [[Durham Cathedral]], and the site of the first translation of the [[Gospels]] into English, [[Aldred the Scribe|Aldred]] writing the Old English [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] between the lines of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 339\u201340</ref>\n\nA [[market town]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|title=Towns in County Durham: Chester-le-Street|accessdate=13 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011245/http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the town holds markets Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nFrom 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district. Originally from 1894, this was the [[Chester-le-Street Rural District]], which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street District]]. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/newsediting/1884450.Unitary_authority_for_County_Durham_confirmed|title=Unitary authority for County Durham confirmed|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6915882.stm|title=Durham unitary authority approved|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> a move that was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1436760.Public_misled_over_unitary_authority_support___claim\n|title=Public misled over unitary authority support \u2013 claim|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6767917.stm|title=Thumbs down for unitary authority|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of [[Iron Age]] use of the [[River Wear]] near the town,<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 6</ref> but the history of Chester-le-Street starts with the Roman fort of [[Concangis]]. This was built alongside the Roman road [[Cade's Road]] (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 45\u201392</ref>\n\nAfter the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of [[Lindisfarne]] seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 337\u201340</ref>  The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic [[titular see]] of [[Cuncacestre]].\n\nThe church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its [[Diocese|bishopric]] seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of [[William Walcher]], the first [[prince-bishop]], at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the [[Normans]] the region was left out of the [[Domesday Book]]; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 354</ref>\n\nCade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by [[stagecoach]], before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the [[A167]] was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster [[A1(M)]].<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 16</ref>\n\nThe coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.<ref>Selkirk (2001) pp. 391\u2013427</ref>\n\nOne of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.<ref>William Page, ''The Victorian History of the County of Durham'' 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153</ref> Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, [[Shute Barrington]], sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===The Jarrow March===\nOn the evening of 5 October 1936 the [[Jarrow March]]ers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jarrow crusade: protest and legend|author=Matt Perry|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVKyAAAAIAAJ|isbn=1-873757-60-3|year=2005|page=31}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Romans called their fort ''Concangis'' or ''Concagium'', a Latinisation of the [[Celts|Celtic]] name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, [[Cong Burn]]. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but ''Concangis'' is the name most cited today.<ref>Selkirk (2001) p. 45</ref><ref>Purdon (1992) p. 8</ref> Although a meaning \"Place of the horse people\" has been given,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html|title=Fox\u2014The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html|title=Fox\u2014P-Celtic Place-Names\u2014Appendix|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Old English]] forms of the name include ''Cuneceastra''<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 10</ref> and ''Conceastre'',<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 337</ref> which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word ''ceaster'' 'Roman fortification'.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\"/> This was shortened over time to Chester, the name used locally for the town ([[Latin]]ised as ''Cestria'').<ref group=\"nb\">For example the old bell in St Mary and St Cuthbert is inscribed in Latin {{quote|{{smallcaps|Magister Robertus Aschbern, Decanus Cestriae, me fecit.

This bell given is thus named Cuthbert}}</ref> But \"Chester\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \"Street\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \"Chester upon Street\" (and describes it as \"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\").<ref>{{cite book|title=An universal etymological English dictionary|author=Bailey, Nathan|year=1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UucIAAAAQAAJ|page=168}}</ref> At some point this was shortened to the modern form.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:ChesterleStreetFlood.JPG|thumb|Flooding on Front Street in 2007]]\n\nThe town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional [[flood]]s. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and [[Riverside Park (Chester-le-Street)|Riverside Park]]. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional [[flash flooding]], usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|title=The Great Flood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024092636/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml|title=Market Refurbishment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024014620/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml| archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:St Mary and St Cuthbert's Church, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.jpg|thumb|left|Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert]]\n\n[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\", a sentiment echoed by [[Daniel Defoe]].\n\n===St Mary and St Cuthbert church===\n{{main| St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street}}\nSt Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country.

It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590.

To start the game, the ball was thrown from a window in the centre of the town and in one game more than 400 players took part. The centre of the street was the dividing line and the winner was the side where the ball was (Up or Down) at 6&nbsp;pm. It was played from the Middle Ages until 1932, when it was outlawed by the police and people trying to carry on the tradition were arrested.<ref>Purdon (1992) pp. 21\u201322</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page24.phtml|title=Shrove Tide Football|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111025115/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page24.phtml|archivedate=11 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  [[Chester-le-Street Town F.C.]] were founded in 1972 and compete in the [[Northern Football League]] Division Two.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nAt the time of the football matches 'Front Street' was actually the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] from London to [[Edinburgh]]. A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the [[A167 road|A167]]. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the [[A1(M)]] motorway in the 1970s.\n\nThe northern end of Front Street used to be the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear|Birtley]], [[Gateshead]], and eventually over the [[Tyne Bridge]] and become the A6127(M) central motorway in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the [[A1(M)]] was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the [[A167 road|A167]]. Car traffic is now banned from the northern part of Front Street and it is restricted to buses, cyclists and delivery vehicles for the shops.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Chester-le-Street Railway Station.jpg|thumb|left|Chester-le-Street Railway Station]]\n[[Chester-le-Street railway station]], on the [[East Coast Main Line]] of the [[National Rail]] network, between Newcastle and Durham, opened in 1868.

Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called [[Concangis]]. This Roman fort is the \"Chester\" (from the Latin ''[[castra]]'') of the town's name; the \"Street\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north\u2013south through the town, and which is now called Front Street.\n\nChester-le-Street is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} west of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]].

Originally from 1894, this was the [[Chester-le-Street Rural District]], which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street District]]. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/newsediting/1884450.Unitary_authority_for_County_Durham_confirmed|title=Unitary authority for County Durham confirmed|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6915882.stm|title=Durham unitary authority approved|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> a move that was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1436760.Public_misled_over_unitary_authority_support___claim\n|title=Public misled over unitary authority support \u2013 claim|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6767917.stm|title=Thumbs down for unitary authority|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of [[Iron Age]] use of the [[River Wear]] near the town,<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 6</ref> but the history of Chester-le-Street starts with the Roman fort of [[Concangis]]. This was built alongside the Roman road [[Cade's Road]] (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 45\u201392</ref>\n\nAfter the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of [[Lindisfarne]] seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 337\u201340</ref>  The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic [[titular see]] of [[Cuncacestre]].\n\nThe church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its [[Diocese|bishopric]] seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of [[William Walcher]], the first [[prince-bishop]], at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the [[Normans]] the region was left out of the [[Domesday Book]]; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 354</ref>\n\nCade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by [[stagecoach]], before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the [[A167]] was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster [[A1(M)]].<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 16</ref>\n\nThe coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.<ref>Selkirk (2001) pp. 391\u2013427</ref>\n\nOne of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.<ref>William Page, ''The Victorian History of the County of Durham'' 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153</ref> Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, [[Shute Barrington]], sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===The Jarrow March===\nOn the evening of 5 October 1936 the [[Jarrow March]]ers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jarrow crusade: protest and legend|author=Matt Perry|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVKyAAAAIAAJ|isbn=1-873757-60-3|year=2005|page=31}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Romans called their fort ''Concangis'' or ''Concagium'', a Latinisation of the [[Celts|Celtic]] name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, [[Cong Burn]].

This bell given is thus named Cuthbert}}</ref> But \"Chester\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \"Street\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \"Chester upon Street\" (and describes it as \"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\").<ref>{{cite book|title=An universal etymological English dictionary|author=Bailey, Nathan|year=1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UucIAAAAQAAJ|page=168}}</ref> At some point this was shortened to the modern form.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:ChesterleStreetFlood.JPG|thumb|Flooding on Front Street in 2007]]\n\nThe town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional [[flood]]s. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and [[Riverside Park (Chester-le-Street)|Riverside Park]]. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional [[flash flooding]], usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|title=The Great Flood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024092636/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml|title=Market Refurbishment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024014620/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml| archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:St Mary and St Cuthbert's Church, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.jpg|thumb|left|Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert]]\n\n[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\", a sentiment echoed by [[Daniel Defoe]].\n\n===St Mary and St Cuthbert church===\n{{main| St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street}}\nSt Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country.

It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to [[Sir Simon Jenkins]] in his ''England's Thousand Best Churches''.

The game was played annually on [[Shrove Tuesday]] between the \"Upstreeters\" and \"Downstreeters\". Play started at 1&nbsp;pm and finished at 6&nbsp;pm. To start the game, the ball was thrown from a window in the centre of the town and in one game more than 400 players took part. The centre of the street was the dividing line and the winner was the side where the ball was (Up or Down) at 6&nbsp;pm.

A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the [[A167 road|A167]]. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the [[A1(M)]] motorway in the 1970s.\n\nThe northern end of Front Street used to be the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear|Birtley]], [[Gateshead]], and eventually over the [[Tyne Bridge]] and become the A6127(M) central motorway in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the [[A1(M)]] was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the [[A167 road|A167]].

WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now [[WFED]], a station founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's [[CBS News Radio|CBS]] affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Logo of WTOP-FM (2000).png|thumb|upright|WTOP's logo in 2000.]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2007).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo before WWWT 107.7 was added to the \"tri-mulcast\".]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2010).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo after the WWWT signal was added.]]\n\n===1920s: Born in Brooklyn===\nWTOP's origins trace back to [[Brooklyn, New York]], as station WTRC (operated by the Twentieth [District] Republican Club), going to air September 25, 1926, on 1250 kilocycles with a power of 50 watts. On August 2, 1927, WTRC migrated to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia]]; a suburb of Washington.\n\nOn January 10, 1929, the call sign was changed to WJSV, reflecting the initials of owner James S. Vance, who was publisher of \"The Fellowship Forum\" and a KKK [[Grand Wizard]] in Virginia. Realizing the expense of running a 10,000-watt radio station, Vance quickly worked out a deal with the nascent [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to become the new network's Washington affiliate, beginning a relationship that would last for almost 90 years. As part of the deal, CBS took over all of WJSV's programming and engineering costs, with an option to renew or purchase the station after five years.\n\n===1930s: CBS O&O===\nIn June 1932, CBS exercised its option to purchase WJSV outright, and moved its operations to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. After three months off the air, WJSV resumed broadcasting on October 20, 1932. [[Arthur Godfrey]], who later hosted a variety program on CBS Radio and CBS Television, hosted a program on WJSV called ''The Sundial'' on which he honed a laid-back, conversational style that was unusual on radio at the time.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, WJSV recorded its entire broadcast day for posterity. The [[WJSV broadcast day]] recordings still exist and copies can be found at archive.org and various [[old time radio]] websites.\n\nWJSV was also a key training ground for pioneering newsman [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]] in the 1930s before he became a network correspondent. (One of his broadcasting mentors was Wells (Ted) Church, who later became a [[CBS News]] executive.) Longtime [[Los Angeles]]-area TV newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]] worked at WJSV in 1938 and continued to work in radio for seven decades until his death in 2008. [[Frank Blair (anchor)|Frank Blair]], who later became an NBC News correspondent and later was a long time news anchor on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show during the 1960s and early 1970s, worked at WJSV.   [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], longtime host of [[game show]] \"[[What's My Line?]]\" and 1950's anchor on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV news, also got his start on WJSV.\n\n===1940s===\nIn 1940, WJSV's operating power was increased to 50,000 watts from a new transmitter site in [[Wheaton, Maryland]]. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]], WJSV moved its broadcast frequency from 1460 to 1500 [[kHz]].\n\nOn March 16, 1943, after paying the [[Tiffin, Ohio]] police department $60,000 for the rights to the call letters WTOP, the calls were changed to the current WTOP because its new frequency was now at the \"top\" of the [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band.\n\nCBS sold 55 percent majority control of WTOP to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in February 1949; this deal was made so CBS could acquire full control of [[KCBS (AM)|KQW]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-24-BC.pdf|title=WTOP-KQW: CBS Sells 55% D.

In the 1960s, after a series of failed music formats, WTOP phased out its music programming for a combination of newscasts and phone-in talk shows.\n\nThe switch to all-news \u2013 at first only during the week \u2013 came in March 1969.<ref name=\"pointer\">{{cite web |last1=Pointer |first1=Jack |title=\u2018You turn us on and we\u2019re there\u2019: Looking back at 50 years of news on WTOP |url=https://wtop.com/local/2019/04/you-turn-us-on-and-were-there-looking-back-at-50-years-of-news-on-wtop |website=WTOP |page=1 April 2019}}</ref> Among those working for WTOP during this time were [[Sam Donaldson]], later on ABC-TV; [[Jim Bohannon]], who took [[Larry King]]'s place on his all-night radio network talk show after King went to CNN; and including Ralph Begleiter and Jamie MacIntyre, both of whom went to CNN.\n\nWTOP studios were apparently a critical link in [[Emergency Broadcast System]] activation scenarios during the Cold War era.<ref>[http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS2089.jpg NIAC Order No. 1, Dec 1970], Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref>\n\nThe ''Post'' sold WTOP to [[The Outlet Company]] in June 1978, in reaction to the FCC looking askance at common ownership of newspapers and broadcasting outlets in the same city, believing one company should not have too much control of local media. One month later, WTOP-TV was swapped with the [[Detroit News]]'s [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]], and became WDVM-TV. The station is today [[WUSA-TV]], owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]. The original FM frequency for WTOP-FM was 96.3&nbsp;MHz, but that frequency was donated to [[Howard University]]. That station became [[WHUR]] in 1971, a commercially run radio station.\n\n===1990s-2020s: Move to FM===\nOutlet re-organized and sold WTOP to Chase Broadcasting in 1989, who in turn sold it to Evergreen Media (which eventually became Chancellor Broadcasting) in November 1992. In April 1997, Evergreen's newly acquired 94.3&nbsp;MHz facility in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] began simulcasting the WTOP signal for better coverage in the sprawling [[Northern Virginia]] suburbs. Shortly afterward, on October 10, 1997, [[Bonneville International Corporation]] purchased WTOP.\n\nOn April 1, 1998, 94.3 was swapped for a stronger signal at 107.7, also licensed to Warrenton. (The 94.3 facility is now [[K-Love]] station [[WLZV]].) Then in December 2000, WTOP gained another simulcast in [[Frederick, Maryland]] with WXTR at 820 [[kHz]], establishing the \"WTOP Radio Network\", a name it used until 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |title=Washington, D.C. |work=TopHour |date=2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321145315/http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |archivedate=March 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOver its first three decades, WTOP commonly broke the all-news format for sports \u2013 including, at various times, the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]] \u2013 and, in its early years, overnight and weekend talk shows. As listeners increasingly indicated a desire for uninterrupted news, this programming dwindled over the years; WTOP completed the transition to 24/7 news when it dropped the Orioles in 1999.<ref name=\"pointer\" />\n\nIn 2005, the station began providing [[podcasts]] of selected broadcast programs, and in 2006, WTOP began broadcasting in digital \"[[HD Radio]]\", utilizing [[iBiquity|iBiquity Digital Corp.'s]] IBOC ([[in-band on-channel]]) technology.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Bonneville International announced that WTOP would move to a new primary frequency of 103.5 FM, then held by classical station [[WGMS (defunct)|WGMS]] (which would move to 103.9 and 104.1 FM). WTOP's longtime facility at 1500 AM, as well as both FM translators (107.7 in Warrenton and low-powered 104.3 in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]]), would be reassigned to the new \"[[WTWP|Washington Post Radio]]\" for a March 30, 2006 launch date. Fittingly, this new partnership also signaled the ''Post'''s return to the radio scene on the very same dial spot WTOP once held.  The station has been dominant in the 25-54 demographics since moving to FM.\n\nThe stations' respective call signs were changed as of January 11, 2006: the former WTOP pair became WTWP (The Washington Post) and WTOP's new primary stations assumed the WTOP calls. [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]]s of the 103.5 carrier originally had broadcast Bonneville International's \"iChannel\" music format, which features unsigned, independent rock bands on the HD2 channel, and the HD3 channel aired continuous traffic and weather updates.  Later iChannel was dropped for an [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]] of the HD2 to a group that currently airs programming aimed at the South Asian community in the Washington area. Sometime in or before June 2013, that LMA was replaced with [[Voice of Russia|the predecessor]] to what is now [[Radio Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_06_13/VoR-6th-Video-Conference-The-PRISM-of-Snooping-2417/?slide-1 |title=VoR 6th Video Conference The PRISM of Snooping |date=June 13, 2013 |website=sputniknews.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}} See caption under top photo for relevant information.</ref> As of July 1, 2017, WTOP-HD2 began broadcasting the feed from [[WFED]] (1500 AM),<ref name=\"dcrtv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcrtv.com/index.html |title=Radio Sputnik Off WTOP - 6/29 |date=June 29, 2017 |website=www.dcrtv.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> after Radio Sputnik moved its Washington DC-area broadcasting to conventional (non-digital) frequency 105.5&nbsp;MHz. Currently, WTOP-FM's HD3 channel is carrying a wide-ranging pop music channel called [[WWFD|\"The Gamut\"]].\n\nIn 2006, WTOP dropped its long-standing association with [[The Weather Channel]] and began airing weather reports exclusively from [[WJLA-TV]] all day long. Previously, WTOP had used weather reports from WJLA chief meteorologist [[Doug Hill (meteorologist)|Doug Hill]] during morning and evening rush hours and The Weather Channel all other times.  Until 2015, the station used all WJLA meteorologists, not just Doug Hill. WJLA's \"Live Super Doppler 7\" has been featured in weather reports as necessary. In 2015, WTOP began airing weather reports and using meteorologists exclusively from [[WRC-TV]] all day long.\n\nIn 2007, the WTOP radio configuration was realigned once again. WTLP-FM (formerly WGYS) at 103.9 picked up the WTOP simulcast on April 6, 2007 after the adult hits \"George 104\" simulcast with WXGG (now [[WPRS-FM]], since sold to Radio One) was broken up, and adopted the WTLP calls on July 5, 2007.\n\nAlso in 2007, WTOP began broadcasting on WJLA's \"Weather Now\" digital sub-channel, which is carried on cable systems well beyond WTOP's broadcast area, though this was ended in late July 2009.\n\nIn May 2007, WTOP sold the naming rights to its \"Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\" (its nickname for its studio) to area business [[Ledo Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrtv.org/ledo.mp3 |title=DCRTV.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  That sponsorship concluded at the end of 2007.  Other sponsorship continues, with sportscasts being \"fed\" by Ledo Pizza.\n\nWTOP AM (which was now on 820 in Frederick) changed its calls to WTWT and switched to the ''Washington Post Radio'' simulcast on June 28, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the 1500/107.7/820 multicast changed format over to a general talk format as \"Talk Radio 3WT\" under the WWWT/WWWT-FM/WWWB call letters, which was cancelled on August 11, 2008. WWWT and WWWB took over the \"Federal News Radio\" format (and for the 1500&nbsp;kHz facility, the [[WFED]] calls),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3wtradio.com/?sid=1457419&nid=24|title=Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com)|author=|date=|website=3wtradio.com}}</ref> while WWWT-FM went back to simulcasting WTOP-FM. The former WFED took over the WTOP callsign on the AM dial and became a simulcast of WTOP, with preemptions for sporting events. On June 13, 2009, the 1050 AM frequency changed to a separate [[Talk radio|news/talk]] format, operated by [[Air America Radio]] as [[WBQH|WZAA]]. On January 26, 2010, following the shutdown of Air America Radio, WZAA returned to the WTOP simulcast. It took back the WTOP call letters on February 1, 2010.  WTOP AM left the simulcast on June 23, 2010, as Bonneville leased the station to [[United Media Group]].  United Media changed the call letters to [[WBQH]] and flipped to [[Regional Mexican]].\n\nIn March 2008, WTOP-FM completed a year-long, $2.5-million state-of-the-art renovation of its newsroom and studios, the first since 1989 when the station moved into the building it presently occupies in northwest Washington.\n\nIn 2008, WTOP-FM generated $51.75-million in revenue, the sixth-highest total for any radio station in the United States and the only station not based in New York City or Los Angeles to crack the top ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbroadcasting.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=16852&p=149992 |title=WVbroadcasting.net |publisher=WVbroadcasting.net |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2009, the station generated $51-million in revenue, good for second among all radio stations in the United States, trailing only [[KIIS-FM]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/15/daily49.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= March 17, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref> In 2010, WTOP generated $57.225-million in revenue, making it tops among radio station in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kelseygroup.com/index.php/2011/03/28/wtop-am-takes-over-the-top-billing-station/ |title=BIA/Kelsey |publisher=Blog.kelseygroup.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2011 WTOP once again generated more revenue than any other station in the United States, this time with $64 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/04/12/wtop-remains-nations-top-biller.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= April 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-13 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref>\n[[File:WTOP reporter filing story on park bench Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|WTOP reporter filing story, [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration Day 2013]]]]\nIn 2010, WTOP-FM's coverage of the record Washington-area snowfalls in early February earned it record ratings as the only local media outlet on the air and covering the storm live all day and night.

This meant that Lisa Baden, the longtime \"voice of D.C.-area traffic\" and a Metro Networks employee, was forced to leave the station in what WTOP's Vice President of News and Programming Jim Farley said was strictly a business decision.

WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now [[WFED]], a station founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's [[CBS News Radio|CBS]] affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Logo of WTOP-FM (2000).png|thumb|upright|WTOP's logo in 2000.]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2007).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo before WWWT 107.7 was added to the \"tri-mulcast\".]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2010).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo after the WWWT signal was added.]]\n\n===1920s: Born in Brooklyn===\nWTOP's origins trace back to [[Brooklyn, New York]], as station WTRC (operated by the Twentieth [District] Republican Club), going to air September 25, 1926, on 1250 kilocycles with a power of 50 watts. On August 2, 1927, WTRC migrated to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia]]; a suburb of Washington.\n\nOn January 10, 1929, the call sign was changed to WJSV, reflecting the initials of owner James S. Vance, who was publisher of \"The Fellowship Forum\" and a KKK [[Grand Wizard]] in Virginia. Realizing the expense of running a 10,000-watt radio station, Vance quickly worked out a deal with the nascent [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to become the new network's Washington affiliate, beginning a relationship that would last for almost 90 years. As part of the deal, CBS took over all of WJSV's programming and engineering costs, with an option to renew or purchase the station after five years.\n\n===1930s: CBS O&O===\nIn June 1932, CBS exercised its option to purchase WJSV outright, and moved its operations to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. After three months off the air, WJSV resumed broadcasting on October 20, 1932. [[Arthur Godfrey]], who later hosted a variety program on CBS Radio and CBS Television, hosted a program on WJSV called ''The Sundial'' on which he honed a laid-back, conversational style that was unusual on radio at the time.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, WJSV recorded its entire broadcast day for posterity. The [[WJSV broadcast day]] recordings still exist and copies can be found at archive.org and various [[old time radio]] websites.\n\nWJSV was also a key training ground for pioneering newsman [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]] in the 1930s before he became a network correspondent. (One of his broadcasting mentors was Wells (Ted) Church, who later became a [[CBS News]] executive.) Longtime [[Los Angeles]]-area TV newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]] worked at WJSV in 1938 and continued to work in radio for seven decades until his death in 2008. [[Frank Blair (anchor)|Frank Blair]], who later became an NBC News correspondent and later was a long time news anchor on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show during the 1960s and early 1970s, worked at WJSV.   [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], longtime host of [[game show]] \"[[What's My Line?]]\" and 1950's anchor on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV news, also got his start on WJSV.\n\n===1940s===\nIn 1940, WJSV's operating power was increased to 50,000 watts from a new transmitter site in [[Wheaton, Maryland]]. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]], WJSV moved its broadcast frequency from 1460 to 1500 [[kHz]].\n\nOn March 16, 1943, after paying the [[Tiffin, Ohio]] police department $60,000 for the rights to the call letters WTOP, the calls were changed to the current WTOP because its new frequency was now at the \"top\" of the [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band.\n\nCBS sold 55 percent majority control of WTOP to the ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in February 1949; this deal was made so CBS could acquire full control of [[KCBS (AM)|KQW]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-24-BC.pdf|title=WTOP-KQW: CBS Sells 55% D.

In the 1960s, after a series of failed music formats, WTOP phased out its music programming for a combination of newscasts and phone-in talk shows.\n\nThe switch to all-news \u2013 at first only during the week \u2013 came in March 1969.<ref name=\"pointer\">{{cite web |last1=Pointer |first1=Jack |title=\u2018You turn us on and we\u2019re there\u2019: Looking back at 50 years of news on WTOP |url=https://wtop.com/local/2019/04/you-turn-us-on-and-were-there-looking-back-at-50-years-of-news-on-wtop |website=WTOP |page=1 April 2019}}</ref> Among those working for WTOP during this time were [[Sam Donaldson]], later on ABC-TV; [[Jim Bohannon]], who took [[Larry King]]'s place on his all-night radio network talk show after King went to CNN; and including Ralph Begleiter and Jamie MacIntyre, both of whom went to CNN.\n\nWTOP studios were apparently a critical link in [[Emergency Broadcast System]] activation scenarios during the Cold War era.<ref>[http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS2089.jpg NIAC Order No. 1, Dec 1970], Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref>\n\nThe ''Post'' sold WTOP to [[The Outlet Company]] in June 1978, in reaction to the FCC looking askance at common ownership of newspapers and broadcasting outlets in the same city, believing one company should not have too much control of local media. One month later, WTOP-TV was swapped with the [[Detroit News]]'s [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]], and became WDVM-TV. The station is today [[WUSA-TV]], owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]. The original FM frequency for WTOP-FM was 96.3&nbsp;MHz, but that frequency was donated to [[Howard University]]. That station became [[WHUR]] in 1971, a commercially run radio station.\n\n===1990s-2020s: Move to FM===\nOutlet re-organized and sold WTOP to Chase Broadcasting in 1989, who in turn sold it to Evergreen Media (which eventually became Chancellor Broadcasting) in November 1992. In April 1997, Evergreen's newly acquired 94.3&nbsp;MHz facility in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] began simulcasting the WTOP signal for better coverage in the sprawling [[Northern Virginia]] suburbs. Shortly afterward, on October 10, 1997, [[Bonneville International Corporation]] purchased WTOP.\n\nOn April 1, 1998, 94.3 was swapped for a stronger signal at 107.7, also licensed to Warrenton. (The 94.3 facility is now [[K-Love]] station [[WLZV]].) Then in December 2000, WTOP gained another simulcast in [[Frederick, Maryland]] with WXTR at 820 [[kHz]], establishing the \"WTOP Radio Network\", a name it used until 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |title=Washington, D.C. |work=TopHour |date=2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321145315/http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |archivedate=March 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOver its first three decades, WTOP commonly broke the all-news format for sports \u2013 including, at various times, the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]] \u2013 and, in its early years, overnight and weekend talk shows. As listeners increasingly indicated a desire for uninterrupted news, this programming dwindled over the years; WTOP completed the transition to 24/7 news when it dropped the Orioles in 1999.<ref name=\"pointer\" />\n\nIn 2005, the station began providing [[podcasts]] of selected broadcast programs, and in 2006, WTOP began broadcasting in digital \"[[HD Radio]]\", utilizing [[iBiquity|iBiquity Digital Corp.'s]] IBOC ([[in-band on-channel]]) technology.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Bonneville International announced that WTOP would move to a new primary frequency of 103.5 FM, then held by classical station [[WGMS (defunct)|WGMS]] (which would move to 103.9 and 104.1 FM). WTOP's longtime facility at 1500 AM, as well as both FM translators (107.7 in Warrenton and low-powered 104.3 in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]]), would be reassigned to the new \"[[WTWP|Washington Post Radio]]\" for a March 30, 2006 launch date. Fittingly, this new partnership also signaled the ''Post'''s return to the radio scene on the very same dial spot WTOP once held.  The station has been dominant in the 25-54 demographics since moving to FM.\n\nThe stations' respective call signs were changed as of January 11, 2006: the former WTOP pair became WTWP (The Washington Post) and WTOP's new primary stations assumed the WTOP calls. [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]]s of the 103.5 carrier originally had broadcast Bonneville International's \"iChannel\" music format, which features unsigned, independent rock bands on the HD2 channel, and the HD3 channel aired continuous traffic and weather updates.  Later iChannel was dropped for an [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]] of the HD2 to a group that currently airs programming aimed at the South Asian community in the Washington area. Sometime in or before June 2013, that LMA was replaced with [[Voice of Russia|the predecessor]] to what is now [[Radio Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_06_13/VoR-6th-Video-Conference-The-PRISM-of-Snooping-2417/?slide-1 |title=VoR 6th Video Conference The PRISM of Snooping |date=June 13, 2013 |website=sputniknews.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}} See caption under top photo for relevant information.</ref> As of July 1, 2017, WTOP-HD2 began broadcasting the feed from [[WFED]] (1500 AM),<ref name=\"dcrtv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcrtv.com/index.html |title=Radio Sputnik Off WTOP - 6/29 |date=June 29, 2017 |website=www.dcrtv.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> after Radio Sputnik moved its Washington DC-area broadcasting to conventional (non-digital) frequency 105.5&nbsp;MHz. Currently, WTOP-FM's HD3 channel is carrying a wide-ranging pop music channel called [[WWFD|\"The Gamut\"]].\n\nIn 2006, WTOP dropped its long-standing association with [[The Weather Channel]] and began airing weather reports exclusively from [[WJLA-TV]] all day long. Previously, WTOP had used weather reports from WJLA chief meteorologist [[Doug Hill (meteorologist)|Doug Hill]] during morning and evening rush hours and The Weather Channel all other times.  Until 2015, the station used all WJLA meteorologists, not just Doug Hill. WJLA's \"Live Super Doppler 7\" has been featured in weather reports as necessary. In 2015, WTOP began airing weather reports and using meteorologists exclusively from [[WRC-TV]] all day long.\n\nIn 2007, the WTOP radio configuration was realigned once again. WTLP-FM (formerly WGYS) at 103.9 picked up the WTOP simulcast on April 6, 2007 after the adult hits \"George 104\" simulcast with WXGG (now [[WPRS-FM]], since sold to Radio One) was broken up, and adopted the WTLP calls on July 5, 2007.\n\nAlso in 2007, WTOP began broadcasting on WJLA's \"Weather Now\" digital sub-channel, which is carried on cable systems well beyond WTOP's broadcast area, though this was ended in late July 2009.\n\nIn May 2007, WTOP sold the naming rights to its \"Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\" (its nickname for its studio) to area business [[Ledo Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrtv.org/ledo.mp3 |title=DCRTV.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  That sponsorship concluded at the end of 2007.  Other sponsorship continues, with sportscasts being \"fed\" by Ledo Pizza.\n\nWTOP AM (which was now on 820 in Frederick) changed its calls to WTWT and switched to the ''Washington Post Radio'' simulcast on June 28, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the 1500/107.7/820 multicast changed format over to a general talk format as \"Talk Radio 3WT\" under the WWWT/WWWT-FM/WWWB call letters, which was cancelled on August 11, 2008. WWWT and WWWB took over the \"Federal News Radio\" format (and for the 1500&nbsp;kHz facility, the [[WFED]] calls),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3wtradio.com/?sid=1457419&nid=24|title=Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com)|author=|date=|website=3wtradio.com}}</ref> while WWWT-FM went back to simulcasting WTOP-FM. The former WFED took over the WTOP callsign on the AM dial and became a simulcast of WTOP, with preemptions for sporting events. On June 13, 2009, the 1050 AM frequency changed to a separate [[Talk radio|news/talk]] format, operated by [[Air America Radio]] as [[WBQH|WZAA]]. On January 26, 2010, following the shutdown of Air America Radio, WZAA returned to the WTOP simulcast. It took back the WTOP call letters on February 1, 2010.  WTOP AM left the simulcast on June 23, 2010, as Bonneville leased the station to [[United Media Group]].  United Media changed the call letters to [[WBQH]] and flipped to [[Regional Mexican]].\n\nIn March 2008, WTOP-FM completed a year-long, $2.5-million state-of-the-art renovation of its newsroom and studios, the first since 1989 when the station moved into the building it presently occupies in northwest Washington.\n\nIn 2008, WTOP-FM generated $51.75-million in revenue, the sixth-highest total for any radio station in the United States and the only station not based in New York City or Los Angeles to crack the top ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbroadcasting.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=16852&p=149992 |title=WVbroadcasting.net |publisher=WVbroadcasting.net |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2009, the station generated $51-million in revenue, good for second among all radio stations in the United States, trailing only [[KIIS-FM]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/15/daily49.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= March 17, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref> In 2010, WTOP generated $57.225-million in revenue, making it tops among radio station in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kelseygroup.com/index.php/2011/03/28/wtop-am-takes-over-the-top-billing-station/ |title=BIA/Kelsey |publisher=Blog.kelseygroup.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2011 WTOP once again generated more revenue than any other station in the United States, this time with $64 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/04/12/wtop-remains-nations-top-biller.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= April 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-13 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref>\n[[File:WTOP reporter filing story on park bench Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|WTOP reporter filing story, [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration Day 2013]]]]\nIn 2010, WTOP-FM's coverage of the record Washington-area snowfalls in early February earned it record ratings as the only local media outlet on the air and covering the storm live all day and night.

Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and [[sculpture]]. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term \"stained glass\" to include domestic [[leadlight|lead light]] and ''[[objet d'art|objets d'art]]'' created from [[came glasswork|foil glasswork]] exemplified in the famous lamps of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].\n\nAs a material ''stained glass'' is glass that has been coloured by adding [[Salt (chemistry)|metallic salts]] during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into ''stained glass windows'' in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. [[Paint]]ed details and yellow [[stain]] are often used to enhance the design. The term ''stained glass'' is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.\n\nStained glass, as an [[art]] and a [[craft]], requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In [[Western Europe]] they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as \"illuminated wall decorations\".\n\nThe design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the [[Bible]], history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church \u2013 episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]]; within a parliament building \u2013 shields of the constituencies; within a college hall \u2013 figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home \u2013 flora, fauna, or landscape.\n\n==Glass production==\n{{Main|Architectural glass}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as [[potash]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], and [[lead]] can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stained Glass in Medieval Europe |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/glas/hd_glas.htm |website=Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters |publisher=The Metropolitain Museum of Art |accessdate=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to [[flashed glass]].\n\n===Cylinder glass or Muff===\nUsing a blow-pipe, a \"gather\" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an [[Annealing (glass)|annealer]] to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. \"Hand-blown\" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows. Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapels as well as many more well respected buildings.\n\n===Crown glass===\nThis hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a [[potter's wheel]]. The [[centrifugal force]] causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the \"bull's-eye\", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the \"pontil\" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out.

Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.\n\n===Rolled glass===\u015e\u0154\u0150\u0156\u0154\u0155\n[[Architectural glass#Rolled plate (figured) glass|Rolled glass]] (sometimes called \"table glass\") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or [[graphite]] table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be \"double rolled\", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8\" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called [[cathedral glass]], but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.\n\n===Flashed glass===\nArchitectural glass must be at least {{sfrac|1|8}} of an inch (3&nbsp;mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of {{sfrac|1|8}} inch (3&nbsp;mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming \"[[flashed glass]]\".\n\nA lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.\n\n===Modern production of traditional glass===\nThere are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular [[Tiffany glass]] and [[Dalle de verre]].\n\n==Colours==\n\n===Transparent glass===\n\nOrdinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include [[manganese dioxide]] which produces [[sodium permanganate]], and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in [[New England]]. [[Selenium]] has been used for the same purpose.<ref name=\"Illustrated Glass Dictionary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205233650/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html Illustrated Glass Dictionary] www.glassonline.com.

Together with [[chromium]] it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make [[wine bottle]]s.\nThe addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass.<ref>[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet \u2013 Chromium] www.speclab.com.

The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.\n* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally \"flashed\" (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.\n*[[Selenium]] is an important agent to make pink and red glass.

A small design called a ''Vidimus'' (from Latin \"we have seen\") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model [[maquette]] may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.\n\nA traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.\n\nA full-sized cartoon is drawn for every \"light\" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple [[tracery]] lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large [[cathedral]] might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.\n\n===Selecting and painting the glass===\n\nEach piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by \"grozing\" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.\n\nFrom 1300 onwards, artists started using \"silver stain\" which was made with [[silver nitrate]]. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as \"Cousin's rose\" was used to enhance flesh tones.\n\nIn the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.\n\nA method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead [[came]]. This allows for the use of techniques such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]] to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.\n\n===Assembly and mounting===\n\nOnce the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see [[Came glasswork]].\n\nTraditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ''ferramenta''. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Technical details\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Heaton, Butler and Bayne01.png|Maquette by [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]], 19th-century English manufacturers\nFile:Pt-coimbra-sevelha3.jpg|Exterior of a window at [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|S\u00e9 Velha de Coimbra]], [[Portugal]], showing a modern steel armature\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral 012 window showing leading and support.JPG|[[Thomas Becket]] window from [[Canterbury]] showing the ''pot metal'' and painted glass, lead H-sectioned ''cames'', modern steel rods and copper wire attachments\nFile:Meaux Vitrail 1867 30808 3.jpg|Skilled glass cutting and leading in a 19th-century window at [[Meaux Cathedral]], [[France]]\nFile:SML-Stained-Glass-5.jpg|A small panel by [[G.

Both the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. [[Phoenicia]] was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Antioch]]. The [[British Museum]] holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the [[Lycurgus Cup]], which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the [[Portland vase]] which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.\n\nIn early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced [[alabaster]] set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.\n\nEvidence of stained-glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when [[Benedict Biscop]] imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at [[Monkwearmouth]]. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at [[Jarrow]].<ref>Discovering stained glass \u2013 John Harries, Carola Hicks, Edition: 3 \u2013 1996</ref>\n\nIn the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at [[Raqqa]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Alabastron Italy Louvre S2375.jpg|A [[perfume]] flask from 100 BC to 200 AD\nFile:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n5.jpg|The [[Portland Vase]], a rare example of Roman flashed glass\nFile:Orvieto083.jpg|An alabaster window in [[Orvieto Cathedral]], Italy\n</gallery>\n\n===In Southwest Asia===\nThe creation of stained glass in [[Southwest Asia]] began in ancient times. One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the [[Assyria]]n city of [[Nineveh]], dating to the seventh century BC. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'', attributed to the 8th century [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemist]] [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]], discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass.<ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%209.htm The Manufacture of Coloured Glass] and [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%2093.html Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.</ref> The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text. \n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Nasirolmolk.jpg|Stained glass in the [[Nasir al-Mulk mosque]] in [[Shiraz]], Iran\nFile:Stained glass Photo From Sahand Ace..jpg|Stained glass in Dowlat Abad Garden at [[Yazd]], [[Iran]]\nFile:Stained glass window in a mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem (12393551704).jpg|From a mosque in [[Jerusalem]], this window contains highly detailed text.\n</gallery>\n\n===Medieval glass in Europe===\n{{see also|Poor Man's Bible|Medieval stained glass}}\n\nStained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the [[Middle Ages]] when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.\n\nIn the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. As [[Gothic architecture]] developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the [[Perpendicular style]] in England.\n\nIntegrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or [[rose window]], developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris and the \"Bishop's Eye\" at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\nWhile stained glass was widely manufactured, [[Chartres]] was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stained Glass}}</ref>\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in France\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|Detail of a 13th-century window from [[Chartres Cathedral]]\nFile:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg-IMG 1465 crop.JPG|''Charlemagne'' from a Romanesque window in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]\nFile:Poitiers, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre -PM 34985 lighter.JPG|The [[Crucifixion]] window of [[Poitiers Cathedral]]\nFile:Vitrail Cath\u00e9drale d'Evreux 22 02 09 13.jpg|Late Gothic [[Tree of Jesse]] window from [[Evreux Cathedral]]\nFile:South rose window of Chartres Cathedral01.jpg|The South Transept windows from Chartres Cathedral\n</gallery>\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in Germany and Austria\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:King David in Augsburg Cathedral light.JPG|''King David'' from [[Augsburg]] Cathedral, early 12th century.

Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] or the [[Life of the Virgin|Life of the Virgin Mary]], surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, [[St Stephen]] and [[St Lawrence]]. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.<ref name=Lee1>Lee, Seddon and Stephens, pp. 118\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of [[Protestantism]]. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the [[Limoges]] factory, and in Italy at [[Murano]], where stained glass and faceted [[lead crystal]] are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.\n\nAt the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the injunctions of [[Thomas Cromwell]] against \"abused images\" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at [[Hengrave Hall]] in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See [[Stained glass \u2013 British glass, 1811\u20131918]] for more details.\n\nIn the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at [[Sint Janskerk|Grote Sint-Jan]] Church, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59&nbsp;feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of [[Dirck Crabeth]] and his brother [[Wouter Crabeth|Wouter]].

The architectural movement was led by [[Augustus Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.\n\nAmong the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were [[William Warrington]] and [[Hardman & Co.|John Hardman]] of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included [[William Wailes]], [[Ward and Hughes]], [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]] and [[Charles Eamer Kempe]]. A Scottish designer, [[Daniel Cottier]], opened firms in Australia and the US.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:St Andrews window 08 6 west John and Paul.jpg|Detail, ''Apostles John and Paul'', [[Hardman of Birmingham]], 1861\u201367, typical of Hardman in its elegant arrangement of figures and purity of colour.

In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the [[S\u00e8vres]] porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.\nIn France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri G\u00e8rente and Andr\u00e9 Lusson.<ref name= GC>Gordon Campbell, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}</ref>\nOther glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail du 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle Reims 020208 03.jpg|Detail of a \"Tree of Jesse\" window in [[Reims Cathedral]] designed in the 13th-century style by L.

There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.<ref name=GC/>  A major firm was [[Mayer of Munich]], which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as [http://www.mayer-of-munich.com/ ''Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.'']. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.<ref name=GC/>\n\nIn the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as [[Carl Geyling's Erben]], which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] from emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cathedral 2 by andy205.jpg|One of five windows donated to [[Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Ludwig II]]\nFile:Ghent Cathedral stained glass.jpg|[[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Ghent Cathedral]], Belgium\nFile:Stained glass in Saint Maurice churche, Olomouc.jpg|A window in the Late Gothic style, [[Church of Saint Maurice (Olomouc)|St Maurice's Church]], Olomouc, [[Czech Republic]], early 20th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Innovations in Britain and Europe===\nAmong the most innovative English designers were the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[William Morris]] (1834\u20131898) and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015</ref> The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.\n\n[[Art Nouveau]] or [[Belle Epoque]] stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of [[Francis Chigot]] of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal [[leadlight]] designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:David's Charge to Solomon, by Burne-Jones and Morris, Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|''David's charge to Solomon'' shows the strongly linear design and use of flashed glass for which Burne-Jones' designs are famous.

Sanford Bray of Boston patented the use of copper foil in stained glass in 1886,https://patents.google.com/patent/US349424A/en However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts & Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the US, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Girl with Cherry Blossoms - Tiffany Glass & Decorating Company, c. 1890.JPG|Many of the distinctive types of glass invented by Tiffany are demonstrated within this single small panel including \"[[fracture-streamer glass]]\" and \"[[drapery glass]]\".\nFile:John LaFarge, Angel of Help (North Easton, MA).JPG|[[John La Farge]], ''The Angel of Help'', [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton, MA]] shows the use of tiny panes contrasting with large areas of  opalescent glass.

At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the [[The Glass House (Fulham)|Glass House]] in London set up by [[Mary Lowndes]] and [[Alfred Drury (stained glass artist)|Alfred J. Drury]] and [[An T\u00far Gloine]] in Dublin, which was run by [[Sarah Purser]] and included artists such as [[Harry Clarke]].\n\nA revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.\n\nOther artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as [[Dalle de verre|Dalle de Verre]], where the glass is set in [[concrete]] or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] and brought to the UK by [[Pierre Fourmaintraux]]. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Dominican Friar]] [[Dom Charles Norris]] OSB of [[Buckfast Abbey]].\n\n[[Gemmail]], a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead [[came]]s to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Le grand dictionnaire Qu&#233bec government's online dictionary entry for '&#39;gemmail'&#39; (in French) |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228139/gemmail Gemmail], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref>\n[[Gemmail|Definition of Gemmail]]\nMany famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably [[Picasso]], have been reproduced in gemmail.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809295,00.html], Gemmail ''Time''</ref> A major exponent of this technique is the German artist [[Walter Womacka]].\n\nAmong the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an [[Abstract art]] form were [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter [[Marc Chagall]] produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include [[John Hayward (stained glass maker)|John Hayward]], [[Douglas Strachan]], [[Ervin Bossanyi]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Karl Parsons]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Patrick Reyntiens]], [[Johannes Schreiter]], [[Judith Schaechter]], [[Paul Woodroffe]], [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Bazaine]] at [[Saint-S\u00e9verin (Paris)|Saint S\u00e9verin]], [[Sergio de Castro (artist)|Sergio de Castro]] at Couvrechef- La Folie ([[Caen]]), [[Hamburg-Dulsberg]] and [[Romont]] (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of [[Gabriel Loire]] at [[Chartres]]. The west windows of England's [[Manchester Cathedral]], by [[Tony Hollaway]], are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.\n\nIn Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of [[Johan Thorn Prikker]] and [[Josef Albers]], and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\">Harrod, Tanya, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press (4 Feb 1999), {{ISBN|978-0300077803}}, p. 452</ref> The works of [[Ludwig Schaffrath]] demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass.  In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as [[Brian Clarke]] were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\" />\n\nIn the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.\n\nAfter the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.\n\nIn the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program's director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]].

From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture.

Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and [[sculpture]]. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term \"stained glass\" to include domestic [[leadlight|lead light]] and ''[[objet d'art|objets d'art]]'' created from [[came glasswork|foil glasswork]] exemplified in the famous lamps of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].\n\nAs a material ''stained glass'' is glass that has been coloured by adding [[Salt (chemistry)|metallic salts]] during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into ''stained glass windows'' in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. [[Paint]]ed details and yellow [[stain]] are often used to enhance the design. The term ''stained glass'' is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.\n\nStained glass, as an [[art]] and a [[craft]], requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In [[Western Europe]] they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as \"illuminated wall decorations\".\n\nThe design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the [[Bible]], history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church \u2013 episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]]; within a parliament building \u2013 shields of the constituencies; within a college hall \u2013 figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home \u2013 flora, fauna, or landscape.\n\n==Glass production==\n{{Main|Architectural glass}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as [[potash]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], and [[lead]] can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stained Glass in Medieval Europe |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/glas/hd_glas.htm |website=Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters |publisher=The Metropolitain Museum of Art |accessdate=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to [[flashed glass]].\n\n===Cylinder glass or Muff===\nUsing a blow-pipe, a \"gather\" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an [[Annealing (glass)|annealer]] to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. \"Hand-blown\" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows. Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapels as well as many more well respected buildings.\n\n===Crown glass===\nThis hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a [[potter's wheel]]. The [[centrifugal force]] causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the \"bull's-eye\", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the \"pontil\" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.\n\n===Rolled glass===\n[[Architectural glass#Rolled plate (figured) glass|Rolled glass]] (sometimes called \"table glass\") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or [[graphite]] table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be \"double rolled\", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8\" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called [[cathedral glass]], but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.\n\n===Flashed glass===\nArchitectural glass must be at least {{sfrac|1|8}} of an inch (3&nbsp;mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of {{sfrac|1|8}} inch (3&nbsp;mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming \"[[flashed glass]]\".\n\nA lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.\n\n===Modern production of traditional glass===\nThere are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular [[Tiffany glass]] and [[Dalle de verre]].\n\n==Colours==\n\n===Transparent glass===\n\nOrdinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include [[manganese dioxide]] which produces [[sodium permanganate]], and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in [[New England]]. [[Selenium]] has been used for the same purpose.<ref name=\"Illustrated Glass Dictionary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205233650/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html Illustrated Glass Dictionary] www.glassonline.com.

Together with [[chromium]] it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make [[wine bottle]]s.\nThe addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass.<ref>[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet \u2013 Chromium] www.speclab.com.

The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.\n* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally \"flashed\" (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.\n*[[Selenium]] is an important agent to make pink and red glass.

A small design called a ''Vidimus'' (from Latin \"we have seen\") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model [[maquette]] may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.\n\nA traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.\n\nA full-sized cartoon is drawn for every \"light\" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple [[tracery]] lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large [[cathedral]] might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.\n\n===Selecting and painting the glass===\n\nEach piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by \"grozing\" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.\n\nFrom 1300 onwards, artists started using \"silver stain\" which was made with [[silver nitrate]]. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as \"Cousin's rose\" was used to enhance flesh tones.\n\nIn the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.\n\nA method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead [[came]]. This allows for the use of techniques such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]] to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.\n\n===Assembly and mounting===\n\nOnce the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see [[Came glasswork]].\n\nTraditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ''ferramenta''. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Technical details\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Heaton, Butler and Bayne01.png|Maquette by [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]], 19th-century English manufacturers\nFile:Pt-coimbra-sevelha3.jpg|Exterior of a window at [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|S\u00e9 Velha de Coimbra]], [[Portugal]], showing a modern steel armature\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral 012 window showing leading and support.JPG|[[Thomas Becket]] window from [[Canterbury]] showing the ''pot metal'' and painted glass, lead H-sectioned ''cames'', modern steel rods and copper wire attachments\nFile:Meaux Vitrail 1867 30808 3.jpg|Skilled glass cutting and leading in a 19th-century window at [[Meaux Cathedral]], [[France]]\nFile:SML-Stained-Glass-5.jpg|A small panel by [[G.

Both the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. [[Phoenicia]] was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Antioch]]. The [[British Museum]] holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the [[Lycurgus Cup]], which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the [[Portland vase]] which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.\n\nIn early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced [[alabaster]] set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.\n\nEvidence of stained-glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when [[Benedict Biscop]] imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at [[Monkwearmouth]]. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at [[Jarrow]].<ref>Discovering stained glass \u2013 John Harries, Carola Hicks, Edition: 3 \u2013 1996</ref>\n\nIn the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at [[Raqqa]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Alabastron Italy Louvre S2375.jpg|A [[perfume]] flask from 100 BC to 200 AD\nFile:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n5.jpg|The [[Portland Vase]], a rare example of Roman flashed glass\nFile:Orvieto083.jpg|An alabaster window in [[Orvieto Cathedral]], Italy\n</gallery>\n\n===In Southwest Asia===\nThe creation of stained glass in [[Southwest Asia]] began in ancient times. One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the [[Assyria]]n city of [[Nineveh]], dating to the seventh century BC. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'', attributed to the 8th century [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemist]] [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]], discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass.<ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%209.htm The Manufacture of Coloured Glass] and [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%2093.html Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.</ref> The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text. \n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Nasirolmolk.jpg|Stained glass in the [[Nasir al-Mulk mosque]] in [[Shiraz]], Iran\nFile:Stained glass Photo From Sahand Ace..jpg|Stained glass in Dowlat Abad Garden at [[Yazd]], [[Iran]]\nFile:Stained glass window in a mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem (12393551704).jpg|From a mosque in [[Jerusalem]], this window contains highly detailed text.\n</gallery>\n\n===Medieval glass in Europe===\n{{see also|Poor Man's Bible|Medieval stained glass}}\n\nStained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the [[Middle Ages]] when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.\n\nIn the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. As [[Gothic architecture]] developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the [[Perpendicular style]] in England.\n\nIntegrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or [[rose window]], developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris and the \"Bishop's Eye\" at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\nWhile stained glass was widely manufactured, [[Chartres]] was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stained Glass}}</ref>\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in France\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|Detail of a 13th-century window from [[Chartres Cathedral]]\nFile:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg-IMG 1465 crop.JPG|''Charlemagne'' from a Romanesque window in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]\nFile:Poitiers, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre -PM 34985 lighter.JPG|The [[Crucifixion]] window of [[Poitiers Cathedral]]\nFile:Vitrail Cath\u00e9drale d'Evreux 22 02 09 13.jpg|Late Gothic [[Tree of Jesse]] window from [[Evreux Cathedral]]\nFile:South rose window of Chartres Cathedral01.jpg|The South Transept windows from Chartres Cathedral\n</gallery>\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in Germany and Austria\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:King David in Augsburg Cathedral light.JPG|''King David'' from [[Augsburg]] Cathedral, early 12th century.

Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] or the [[Life of the Virgin|Life of the Virgin Mary]], surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, [[St Stephen]] and [[St Lawrence]]. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.<ref name=Lee1>Lee, Seddon and Stephens, pp. 118\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of [[Protestantism]]. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the [[Limoges]] factory, and in Italy at [[Murano]], where stained glass and faceted [[lead crystal]] are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.\n\nAt the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the injunctions of [[Thomas Cromwell]] against \"abused images\" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at [[Hengrave Hall]] in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See [[Stained glass \u2013 British glass, 1811\u20131918]] for more details.\n\nIn the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at [[Sint Janskerk|Grote Sint-Jan]] Church, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59&nbsp;feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of [[Dirck Crabeth]] and his brother [[Wouter Crabeth|Wouter]].

The architectural movement was led by [[Augustus Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.\n\nAmong the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were [[William Warrington]] and [[Hardman & Co.|John Hardman]] of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included [[William Wailes]], [[Ward and Hughes]], [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]] and [[Charles Eamer Kempe]]. A Scottish designer, [[Daniel Cottier]], opened firms in Australia and the US.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:St Andrews window 08 6 west John and Paul.jpg|Detail, ''Apostles John and Paul'', [[Hardman of Birmingham]], 1861\u201367, typical of Hardman in its elegant arrangement of figures and purity of colour.

[[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Revival in France===\n{{see|List of French stained glass manufacturers}}\nIn France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the [[S\u00e8vres]] porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.\nIn France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri G\u00e8rente and Andr\u00e9 Lusson.<ref name= GC>Gordon Campbell, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}</ref>\nOther glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail du 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle Reims 020208 03.jpg|Detail of a \"Tree of Jesse\" window in [[Reims Cathedral]] designed in the 13th-century style by L.

There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.<ref name=GC/>  A major firm was [[Mayer of Munich]], which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as [http://www.mayer-of-munich.com/ ''Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.'']. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.<ref name=GC/>\n\nIn the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as [[Carl Geyling's Erben]], which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] from emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cathedral 2 by andy205.jpg|One of five windows donated to [[Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Ludwig II]]\nFile:Ghent Cathedral stained glass.jpg|[[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Ghent Cathedral]], Belgium\nFile:Stained glass in Saint Maurice churche, Olomouc.jpg|A window in the Late Gothic style, [[Church of Saint Maurice (Olomouc)|St Maurice's Church]], Olomouc, [[Czech Republic]], early 20th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Innovations in Britain and Europe===\nAmong the most innovative English designers were the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[William Morris]] (1834\u20131898) and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015</ref> The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.\n\n[[Art Nouveau]] or [[Belle Epoque]] stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of [[Francis Chigot]] of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal [[leadlight]] designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:David's Charge to Solomon, by Burne-Jones and Morris, Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|''David's charge to Solomon'' shows the strongly linear design and use of flashed glass for which Burne-Jones' designs are famous.

Sanford Bray of Boston patented the use of copper foil in stained glass in 1886,https://patents.google.com/patent/US349424A/en However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts & Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the US, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Girl with Cherry Blossoms - Tiffany Glass & Decorating Company, c. 1890.JPG|Many of the distinctive types of glass invented by Tiffany are demonstrated within this single small panel including \"[[fracture-streamer glass]]\" and \"[[drapery glass]]\".\nFile:John LaFarge, Angel of Help (North Easton, MA).JPG|[[John La Farge]], ''The Angel of Help'', [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton, MA]] shows the use of tiny panes contrasting with large areas of  opalescent glass.

At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the [[The Glass House (Fulham)|Glass House]] in London set up by [[Mary Lowndes]] and [[Alfred Drury (stained glass artist)|Alfred J. Drury]] and [[An T\u00far Gloine]] in Dublin, which was run by [[Sarah Purser]] and included artists such as [[Harry Clarke]].\n\nA revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.\n\nOther artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as [[Dalle de verre|Dalle de Verre]], where the glass is set in [[concrete]] or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] and brought to the UK by [[Pierre Fourmaintraux]]. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Dominican Friar]] [[Dom Charles Norris]] OSB of [[Buckfast Abbey]].\n\n[[Gemmail]], a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead [[came]]s to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Le grand dictionnaire Qu&#233bec government's online dictionary entry for '&#39;gemmail'&#39; (in French) |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228139/gemmail Gemmail], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref>\n[[Gemmail|Definition of Gemmail]]\nMany famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably [[Picasso]], have been reproduced in gemmail.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809295,00.html], Gemmail ''Time''</ref> A major exponent of this technique is the German artist [[Walter Womacka]].\n\nAmong the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an [[Abstract art]] form were [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter [[Marc Chagall]] produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include [[John Hayward (stained glass maker)|John Hayward]], [[Douglas Strachan]], [[Ervin Bossanyi]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Karl Parsons]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Patrick Reyntiens]], [[Johannes Schreiter]], [[Judith Schaechter]], [[Paul Woodroffe]], [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Bazaine]] at [[Saint-S\u00e9verin (Paris)|Saint S\u00e9verin]], [[Sergio de Castro (artist)|Sergio de Castro]] at Couvrechef- La Folie ([[Caen]]), [[Hamburg-Dulsberg]] and [[Romont]] (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of [[Gabriel Loire]] at [[Chartres]]. The west windows of England's [[Manchester Cathedral]], by [[Tony Hollaway]], are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.\n\nIn Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of [[Johan Thorn Prikker]] and [[Josef Albers]], and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\">Harrod, Tanya, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press (4 Feb 1999), {{ISBN|978-0300077803}}, p. 452</ref> The works of [[Ludwig Schaffrath]] demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass.  In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as [[Brian Clarke]] were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\" />\n\nIn the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.\n\nAfter the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.\n\nIn the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program's director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]].

Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in the mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York's Congregation Anshi Chesed.  From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture.  Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts.  As with churches, synagogue stained glass windows are often dedicated by member families in exchange for major financial contributions to the institution.\n\n===Places of worship===\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Sainte-Chapelle Choeur.JPG|The dazzling display of medieval glass at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\nFile:Stained Glass Window, Church of Our Lady, Koblenz - Germany..jpg|The chancel windows of the Church of Our Lady, [[Koblenz]], Germany\nFile:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|Sunlight shining through stained glass onto coloured carpet of [[Nasir ol Molk Mosque]]\nFile:DSC04484 Istanbul - Sultan Ahmet camii (Moschea blu) - Foto G.

In their simplest form they typically depict birds and flowers in small panels, often surrounded with machine-made ''[[cathedral glass]]'' which, despite what the name suggests, is pale-coloured and textured. Some large homes have splendid examples of secular pictorial glass. Many small houses of the 19th and early 20th centuries have [[leadlight]] windows.\n\n* [[Prairie School|Prairie style]] homes\n* The houses of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Shaki khan palace 1.jpg|[[Shabaka (window)|Shabaka]] (stained glass) at the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Public and commercial buildings===\nStained glass has often been used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public and commercial places such as banks, retailers and railway stations.
