{"title_page": "Self-concealment", "text_new": "'''Self-concealment''' is a psychological construct defined as \"a predisposition to actively [[wiktionary:conceal|conceal]] from others personal information that one perceives as [[Mental distress|distressing]] or negative\".<ref name = Larson>Larson and Chastain (1990).</ref> Its opposite is [[self-disclosure]].<ref name=\"Larson\" /><ref name=\"Uysal\">Uysal, Lin, and Knee (2010).</ref> \n\nThe concealed personal information (thoughts, [[Feeling|feelings]], actions, or events) is highly intimate, negative in [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] and has three characteristics: it is a subset of private information, can be consciously accessed, and is actively concealed from others. Self-concealment significantly contributes to negative [[Mental health|psychological health]]. \n\n== Historical context ==\n\nSecrets and secret keeping have been a longstanding interest of psychologists and psychotherapists.<ref name = Larson2>Larson (1993).</ref> [[Sidney Jourard|Jourard's]]<ref name=Jourard1>Jourard (1971a).</ref><ref name=Jourard2>Jourard (1971b).</ref> work on self-disclosure and Pennebaker's research on the health benefits of disclosing traumatic events and secrets set the stage for the conceptualization and measurement of self-concealment. \n\nJourard's research pointed to the conclusion that stress and illness result not only from low self-disclosure, but more so from the intentional avoidance of being known by another person. In a later line of research, [[James Pennebaker|Pennebaker]]<ref name=\"Pennebaker1\">Pennebaker and Chew (1985).</ref><ref name=\"Pennebaker2\">Pennebaker, Zech and Rime (2001).</ref> and his colleagues examined the confiding-illness relation or the inhibition-disease link and found that not expressing thoughts and feelings about traumatic events is associated with long-term health effects. Pennebaker attributed the unwillingness to disclose distressing personal information to either circumstances or individual differences. The self-concealment construct, and the scale for its measurement, the Self-Concealment Scale, were introduced to permit assessment and conceptualization of individual differences on this personality dimension.\n\n== Psychological effects ==\nSelf-concealment uniquely and significantly contributes to the prediction of [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and physical symptoms.<ref name=\"Larson\" /> Subsequent research has examined the effects of self-concealment on [[subjective well-being]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], finding that high self-concealment is associated with psychological distress and self-reported physical symptoms,<ref name=\"Cepida-Benito1\">Cepeda-Benito and Short (1998).</ref> anxiety and depression<ref name=\"Kahn1\">Kahn & Hessling (2001).</ref><ref name=\"Kelly & Achter, 1995\">Kelly & Achter (1995).</ref><ref name=\"PennebakerColderSharp\">Pennebaker, Colder, & Sharp (1990).</ref>, [[shyness]], negative [[self-esteem]],<ref name=\"Ichiyama1\">Ichiyama et al.

In a later line of research, [[James Pennebaker|Pennebaker]]<ref name=\"Pennebaker1\">Pennebaker and Chew (1985).</ref><ref name=\"Pennebaker2\">Pennebaker, Zech and Rime (2001).</ref> and his colleagues examined the confiding-illness relation or the inhibition-disease link and found that not expressing thoughts and feelings about traumatic events is associated with long-term health effects. Pennebaker attributed the unwillingness to disclose distressing personal information to either circumstances or individual differences. The self-concealment construct, and the scale for its measurement, the Self-Concealment Scale, were introduced to permit assessment and conceptualization of individual differences on this personality dimension.\n\n== Psychological effects ==\nSelf-concealment uniquely and significantly contributes to the prediction of [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and physical symptoms.<ref name=\"Larson\" /> Subsequent research has examined the effects of self-concealment on [[subjective well-being]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], finding that high self-concealment is associated with psychological distress and self-reported physical symptoms,<ref name=\"Cepida-Benito1\">Cepeda-Benito and Short (1998).</ref> anxiety and depression<ref name=\"Kahn1\">Kahn & Hessling (2001).</ref><ref name=\"Kelly & Achter, 1995\">Kelly & Achter (1995).</ref><ref name=\"PennebakerColderSharp\">Pennebaker, Colder, & Sharp (1990).</ref>, [[shyness]], negative [[self-esteem]],<ref name=\"Ichiyama1\">Ichiyama et al.

The series is based on the ''Detective Murdoch'' novels by [[Maureen Jennings]] and is set in Toronto around the turn of the 20th century. It centres on William Murdoch ([[Yannick Bisson]]), a detective at Station House Four, who solves crimes using scientific techniques and inventions which are highly advanced for the time (e.g. fingerprinting). He is assisted by Constable George Crabtree ([[Jonny Harris (actor)|Jonny Harris]]), city coroner Doctor Julia Ogden ([[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]]), and Inspector Thomas Brackenreid ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]). The show was developed for television by R.B.

Doctor Ogden, who was also at the beach, conducts a preliminary examination of the body in situ and finds what appears to be large bite marks from an animal on the victim's body. Inspector Brackenreid is convinced that the marks came from a large creature he believes he saw in Lake Ontario shortly before Katherine's body was discovered. Although initially skeptical, Detective Murdoch becomes convinced that there may be a large creature living in the lake when he later spots it while with the inspector. Perhaps more unusual than the multiple sightings of the creature is the fact that Constable Crabtree, who believes in the existence of everything from aliens to zombies, remains unconvinced that such a creature exists even after a second body, that of Marie Nicholson, is found with similar bite marks on her body. Both of the dead women had been contestants in the Miss Purity competition. In addition, Marie, at the time of her death, was engaged to Katherine's former beau. Constable Crabtree pursues these connections between the two women as possible motives for their deaths. Detective Murdoch, on the other hand, tries to determine what type of animal may be living in the lake and implicated in the two women's deaths.\n| LineColor       = B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 86\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = Republic of Murdoch\n| DirectedBy      = Don McCutcheon\n| WrittenBy       = Paul Aitken and Peter Mitchell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|11|25}}\n| Viewers         = 1.40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_11_25_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) November 25, 2013 \u2013 December 1, 2013 |date=December 10, 2013 |publisher=[[BBM Canada]] |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114082400/http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_11_25_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = A murder victim leads Murdoch and Crabtree to chasing a potential suspect to Newfoundland, where they are caught between a family feud for a treasure map.\n| LineColor       = B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 87\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Midnight Train to Kingston\n| DirectedBy      = Don McCutcheon\n| WrittenBy       = Paul Aitken and Peter Mitchell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|12|2}}\n| Viewers         = 1.41<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_12_02_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) December 2, 2013 \u2013 December 8, 2013 |date=December 17, 2013 |publisher=[[BBM Canada]] |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113104503/https://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_12_02_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2014 }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Murdoch and his colleagues escort James Gillies to his execution in Kingston via train.

The series is based on the ''Detective Murdoch'' novels by [[Maureen Jennings]] and is set in Toronto around the turn of the 20th century. It centres on William Murdoch ([[Yannick Bisson]]), a detective at Station House Four, who solves crimes using scientific techniques and inventions which are highly advanced for the time (e.g. fingerprinting). He is assisted by Constable George Crabtree ([[Jonny Harris (actor)|Jonny Harris]]), city coroner Doctor Julia Ogden ([[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]]), and Inspector Thomas Brackenreid ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]). The show was developed for television by R.B. Carney, Cal Coons, and Alexandra Zarowny, and is produced by [[Shaftesbury Films]].\n\nThe series was preceded by three television movies, which aired on [[Bravo!]] from 2004 to 2005. These featured a different cast: [[Peter Outerbridge]] as Murdoch, [[Keeley Hawes]] as Doctor Ogden, [[Matthew MacFadzean]] as Constable Crabtree, and [[Colm Meaney]] as Inspector Brackenreid.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Murdoch Mysteries (TV Series 2004) |work=IMDb |accessdate=March 9, 2015 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386955/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm}}</ref>\n\n''Murdoch Mysteries'' aired on [[Citytv]] for five seasons before being cancelled.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/citytv-killing-murdoch-mysteries-after-upcoming-season/article595907/|title=Citytv killing Murdoch Mysteries after upcoming season|author=The Canadian Press|date=September 27, 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> It was then picked up by [[CBC Television|CBC]], where it has aired since season six.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/05/11/cbc_fall_201213_lineup_a_few_new_faces_less_original_programming.html |title=CBC fall 2012\u201313 lineup: a few new faces, less original programming |last=DeMara |first=Bruce |date=May 11, 2012 |newspaper=Toronto Star |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref> The show airs in the UK on [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], and is co-produced by Alibi's parent company, [[UKTV]].

Then a murder victim is discovered, vindicating Tess, and a second body \u2013 tortured to death \u2013 is also found.

Barely over that shock, Murdoch learns that Anna's fianc\u00e9, a businessman from New York City, has vanished. Murdoch suspects Anna's betrothed may be connected to a bizarre murder aboard a streetcar... a shooting no one heard. When the Anna's fianc\u00e9 also turns up dead, Murdoch fears the work of The Black Hand \u2013 the forerunner of the Mafia \u2013 behind both killings.

Their reunion is strained when suspicion falls on two nuns. Susannah insists the nuns are innocent, claiming that a reclusive nun, Sister Catherine, communes with angels and that the angels told Sister Catherine that a demon is responsible for the priest's murder. Murdoch's reluctance to accept this pits Susannah against him and calls his religious beliefs into question. When Murdoch realizes that the murder victim was not a priest but an impostor and that he had a criminal history, the case takes on a more earthly footing. When the true source of Sister Catherine's angelic messages eventually becomes clear, it uncovers a love triangle of deceit and revenge.

The facts fit Crabtree's theory, even more so when Murdoch discovers that three other schoolgirls met with a mystery man and bear mysterious bite marks on their necks. Toronto Gazette reporter Paddy Glynn stirs up a public outcry and soon, reports of vampires are rolling in from all over the city. Even Julia is swept up by Stoker's tale of forbidden sexuality, struggling to control her yearning for Murdoch despite her engagement to Darcy, but when another schoolgirl is attacked, Murdoch uncovers the identity of the mystery man and the motive behind his deadly quest for blood.

Doctor Ogden, who was also at the beach, conducts a preliminary examination of the body in situ and finds what appears to be large bite marks from an animal on the victim's body. Inspector Brackenreid is convinced that the marks came from a large creature he believes he saw in Lake Ontario shortly before Katherine's body was discovered. Although initially skeptical, Detective Murdoch becomes convinced that there may be a large creature living in the lake when he later spots it while with the inspector. Perhaps more unusual than the multiple sightings of the creature is the fact that Constable Crabtree, who believes in the existence of everything from aliens to zombies, remains unconvinced that such a creature exists even after a second body, that of Marie Nicholson, is found with similar bite marks on her body. Both of the dead women had been contestants in the Miss Purity competition. In addition, Marie, at the time of her death, was engaged to Katherine's former beau. Constable Crabtree pursues these connections between the two women as possible motives for their deaths. Detective Murdoch, on the other hand, tries to determine what type of animal may be living in the lake and implicated in the two women's deaths.\n| LineColor       = B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 86\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = Republic of Murdoch\n| DirectedBy      = Don McCutcheon\n| WrittenBy       = Paul Aitken and Peter Mitchell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|11|25}}\n| Viewers         = 1.40<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_11_25_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) November 25, 2013 \u2013 December 1, 2013 |date=December 10, 2013 |publisher=[[BBM Canada]] |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114082400/http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_11_25_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = A murder victim leads Murdoch and Crabtree to chasing a potential suspect to Newfoundland, where they are caught between a family feud for a treasure map.\n| LineColor       = B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 87\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Midnight Train to Kingston\n| DirectedBy      = Don McCutcheon\n| WrittenBy       = Paul Aitken and Peter Mitchell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|12|2}}\n| Viewers         = 1.41<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_12_02_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) December 2, 2013 \u2013 December 8, 2013 |date=December 17, 2013 |publisher=[[BBM Canada]] |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113104503/https://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2013-14/2013-14_12_02_TV_ME_NationalTop30.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2014 }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Murdoch and his colleagues escort James Gillies to his execution in Kingston via train.

The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was formed. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to '''South Dakota State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts'''. In 1964, the name was changed to '''South Dakota State University'''. The name change was largely promoted by the Alumni Association. Initiated in 1962, this name change reflected the more comprehensive education offered at the university.<ref>{{Cite web|title = South Dakota State University \u2013 History|url = http://www.statealum.com/s/1108/index.aspx?gid=1&pgid=1869|website = www.statealum.com|accessdate = 2015-09-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100800/http://www.statealum.com/s/1108/index.aspx?gid=1&pgid=1869|archive-date = 2016-03-04|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, SDSU's instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the University changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences.\n\nIn 2017, the colleges which make up the university were revised and in some cases renamed to the following: College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy & Allied Health Professions; \nGraduate School; Jerome J. Lohr College of Engineering; University College; and Van D. and Barbara B. Fishback Honors College.\n\n===Presidents===\nOn May 23, 2016 (formal inauguration held September 29, 2016), Barry H.

Student housing is located in three areas:  the Medary complex located in the northwest corner of campus, consisting of traditional residence halls, Hansen, and Waneta, and apartment-style living at Meadows North and Meadows South; the Grove complex near the Student Union, consisting of traditional residence halls, Brown, Mathews and Pierson, as well as a newer (2010) variation on the theme of traditional residence halls in Spencer, Thorne and Abbott (also called the Jackrabbit Village); and the Larson complex on the east side of campus, consisting of traditional halls Binnewies and Young and suite living at Caldwell Hall. The residential halls on the campus of SDSU make up the densest concentration of people in South Dakota.\n\nAll of the residence halls with the exceptions of Caldwell and both Meadows buildings are co-ed by wing, with each wing having its own bathroom.  Caldwell Hall is suite style, meaning two rooms share a common bathroom for the four occupants and each floor on Caldwell is co-ed.  The Meadows North and Meadows South apartment complexes feature four-bedroom apartments.\n\nIn addition to the Medary, Grove, and Larson complexes for single students, SDSU has 80 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedroom apartments available for rent for married students in State Court and State Village. State Court and State Village are located on the southeast side of campus.\n[[File:Abbott Hall SDSU.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Modern-styled dormitories]]\n\nSome residence halls have a Living/Learning Community, where an entire floor is composed of a certain group of students.  Examples include Agriculture and Biology Majors, Honors College, Engineering House, Health Professionals House and Substance-Free.\n\nFurniture in the halls is moveable and the provided beds may be lofted; students do not need to purchase or bring their own loft. Residents may also contract phone and cable services with the appropriate companies. Washers and dryers are available in all the halls and operate with either cash or by using campus Hobo Dough.\n\n[[Ben Reifel|Ben Reifel Hall]], Hyde, [[Theodore Schultz|Theodore Schultz Hall]] and the Honors Hall (collectively, the Jackrabbit Grove) opened in the fall of 2013. Schultz Hall is home of the Ag & Rural and Wellness Living Communities and the Honors Hall, as the name suggests, is home to the Honors College. They are similar in amenities to the Jackrabbit Village halls (Spencer, Thorne and Abbott).\n\nThe most recent addition to the dormitories was the Southeast University Neighborhood, located on the corner of 8th Street and 16th Avenue. These dorms are intended for juniors, seniors, and graduate students, and are thus more similar to regular apartments, with full kitchens, furniture, and summer storage, even a Starbucks attached.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdstate.edu/residential-life/southeast-university-neighborhood-apartments|title=Southeast University Neighborhood Apartments|website=South Dakota State University|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Nearby are the Townhouses, which are similar to the Neighborhood dorms, but also allow pets and do not require meal plans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdstate.edu/residential-life/southeast-university-townhouses|title=Southeast University Townhouses|website=South Dakota State University|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n===Greek societies===\nThis list contains only social fraternities that are a part of either the Interfraternity Council or the College Panhellenic Association.<ref name=\"sdsugreek.com\"/> Other fraternities and sororities exist as general student organizations.\n*[[Alpha Gamma Rho]] (\u0391\u0393\u03a1)\n*[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]] (\u0391\u03a9\u0395)\n*[[Alpha Xi Delta]] (\u0391\u039e\u0394)\n*Ceres\n*[[Chi Omega]] (\u03a7\u03a9)\n*[[Delta Chi]] (\u0394\u03a7)\n*[[FarmHouse]] (FH)\n*[[Lambda Chi Alpha]] (\u039b\u03a7\u0391)\n*[[Pi Kappa Alpha]] (\u03a0\u039a\u0391)\n*[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] (\u03a3\u0391\u0395)\n*[[Sigma Phi Delta]] (\u03a3\u03a6\u0394)\n*[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] (\u03a3\u03a6\u0395)\n\n==Student life==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eisenhower on Hobo Day.jpg|thumb|300px|Then-presidential candidate [[Eisenhower|Dwight D.

The [[Dakota Marker]] is the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual college football game played between the two. The trophy is a replica of one of many stone boundary markers that can be found along the border between the states of [[South Dakota]] and [[North Dakota]]. South Dakota State also battles their in-state rival, the [[South Dakota Coyotes football|University of South Dakota]]. South Dakota State has not lost to their in-state rival since 2000; however, despite the one-sided nature of the rivalry, it has been dubbed the [[South Dakota Showdown Series]].\n\n====Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities====\n{{Main|Dana J.

The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was formed. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to '''South Dakota State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts'''. In 1964, the name was changed to '''South Dakota State University'''. The name change was largely promoted by the Alumni Association. Initiated in 1962, this name change reflected the more comprehensive education offered at the university.<ref>{{Cite web|title = South Dakota State University \u2013 History|url = http://www.statealum.com/s/1108/index.aspx?gid=1&pgid=1869|website = www.statealum.com|accessdate = 2015-09-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100800/http://www.statealum.com/s/1108/index.aspx?gid=1&pgid=1869|archive-date = 2016-03-04|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, SDSU's instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the University changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences.\n\nIn 2017, the colleges which make up the university were revised and in some cases renamed to the following: College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy & Allied Health Professions; \nGraduate School; Jerome J. Lohr College of Engineering; University College; and Van D. and Barbara B. Fishback Honors College.\n\n===Presidents===\nOn May 23, 2016 (formal inauguration held September 29, 2016), Barry H.

Student housing is located in three areas:  the Medary complex located in the northwest corner of campus, consisting of traditional residence halls, Hansen, and Waneta, and apartment-style living at Meadows North and Meadows South; the Grove complex near the Student Union, consisting of traditional residence halls, Brown, Mathews and Pierson, as well as a newer (2010) variation on the theme of traditional residence halls in Spencer, Thorne and Abbott (also called the Jackrabbit Village); and the Larson complex on the east side of campus, consisting of traditional halls Binnewies and Young and suite living at Caldwell Hall. The residential halls on the campus of SDSU make up the densest concentration of people in South Dakota.\n\nAll of the residence halls with the exceptions of Caldwell and both Meadows buildings are co-ed by wing, with each wing having its own bathroom.  Caldwell Hall is suite style, meaning two rooms share a common bathroom for the four occupants and each floor on Caldwell is co-ed.  The Meadows North and Meadows South apartment complexes feature four-bedroom apartments.\n\nIn addition to the Medary, Grove, and Larson complexes for single students, SDSU has 80 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedroom apartments available for rent for married students in State Court and State Village. State Court and State Village are located on the southeast side of campus.\n[[File:Abbott Hall SDSU.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Modern-styled dormitories]]\n\nSome residence halls have a Living/Learning Community, where an entire floor is composed of a certain group of students.  Examples include Agriculture and Biology Majors, Honors College, Engineering House, Health Professionals House and Substance-Free.\n\nFurniture in the halls is moveable and the provided beds may be lofted; students do not need to purchase or bring their own loft. Residents may also contract phone and cable services with the appropriate companies. Washers and dryers are available in all the halls and operate with either cash or by using campus Hobo Dough.\n\n[[Ben Reifel|Ben Reifel Hall]], Hyde, [[Theodore Schultz|Theodore Schultz Hall]] and the Honors Hall (collectively, the Jackrabbit Grove) opened in the fall of 2013. Schultz Hall is home of the Ag & Rural and Wellness Living Communities and the Honors Hall, as the name suggests, is home to the Honors College. They are similar in amenities to the Jackrabbit Village halls (Spencer, Thorne and Abbott).\n\nThe most recent addition to the dormitories was the Southeast University Neighborhood, located on the corner of 8th Street and 16th Avenue. These dorms are intended for juniors, seniors, and graduate students, and are thus more similar to regular apartments, with full kitchens, furniture, and summer storage, even a Starbucks attached.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdstate.edu/residential-life/southeast-university-neighborhood-apartments|title=Southeast University Neighborhood Apartments|website=South Dakota State University|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Nearby are the Townhouses, which are similar to the Neighborhood dorms, but also allow pets and do not require meal plans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdstate.edu/residential-life/southeast-university-townhouses|title=Southeast University Townhouses|website=South Dakota State University|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n===Greek societies===\nThis list contains only social fraternities that are a part of either the Interfraternity Council or the College Panhellenic Association.<ref name=\"sdsugreek.com\"/> Other fraternities and sororities exist as general student organizations.\n*[[Alpha Gamma Rho]] (\u0391\u0393\u03a1)\n*[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]] (\u0391\u03a9\u0395)\n*[[Alpha Xi Delta]] (\u0391\u039e\u0394)\n*Ceres\n*[[Chi Omega]] (\u03a7\u03a9)\n*[[Delta Chi]] (\u0394\u03a7)\n*[[FarmHouse]] (FH)\n*[[Lambda Chi Alpha]] (\u039b\u03a7\u0391)\n*[[Pi Kappa Alpha]] (\u03a0\u039a\u0391)\n*[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] (\u03a3\u0391\u0395)\n*[[Sigma Phi Delta]] (\u03a3\u03a6\u0394)\n*[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] (\u03a3\u03a6\u0395)\n\n==Student life==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eisenhower on Hobo Day.jpg|thumb|300px|Then-presidential candidate [[Eisenhower|Dwight D.

The [[Dakota Marker]] is the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual college football game played between the two. The trophy is a replica of one of many stone boundary markers that can be found along the border between the states of [[South Dakota]] and [[North Dakota]]. South Dakota State also battles their in-state rival, the [[South Dakota Coyotes football|University of South Dakota]]. South Dakota State has not lost to their in-state rival since 2000; however, despite the one-sided nature of the rivalry, it has been dubbed the [[South Dakota Showdown Series]].\n\n====Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities====\n{{Main|Dana J.

The SJAC has bleacher seating for up to 1,000 spectators and can be used for track practice and track meets, football practice, softball and baseball practice, and other events within the SDSU athletic department.  It includes 149,284-square foot facility making it the largest indoor practice facility in Division I athletics and features an eight-lane, 300-meter track, one of only five collegiate indoor tracks of that size in the nation.\n\nThe Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium, a 19,340-capacity stadium, opened in the fall of 2016. It was constructed for an expansion to 22,500 and the potential for future expansion to a capacity of 40,000. It is also a soy-based AstroTurf. It is considered among the premier FCS Division 1 stadiums.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of South Dakota State University people}}\nSouth Dakota State University has produced a number of the current members of South Dakota's state government and in Congress, including Congresswoman [[Kristi Noem]], who subsequently is the first-female Governor of South Dakota, and current U.S. Senator [[Mike Rounds]].
