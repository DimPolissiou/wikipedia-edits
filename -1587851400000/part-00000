It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"word\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' || Independent country from 1991\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Patria del Friuli]] ruled present western Slovenia until [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] takeover in 1420.\n\n[[File:Boj s Turki-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The Ottoman army battling the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Habsburgs]] in present-day Slovenia during the [[Great Turkish War]].]]\nAt the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Slovene Lands]] suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Turkish raids]].

The other locations in the United States where many Slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities: Pittsburgh, Chicago, Pueblo, Butte, northern Minnesota, and the Salt Lake Valley.

The idea of a [[United Slovenia]], first advanced during the [[revolutions of 1848]], became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.\n\nIn September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8 |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072954/http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183414/http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> <!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which \"The Rally of Truth\" in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|accessdate=4 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archivedate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title=\"Rally of truth\" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--> On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the \"Republic of Slovenia\".<ref name=\"twenty.si\">{{cite web|author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave<!-- sic! --> Socialisti\u010dne Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |journal=Uradni List Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik]] emerged victorious.\n[[File:Teritorialci so z armbrustom zadeli tank v kri\u017ei\u0161\u010du pred MMP Ro\u017ena Dolina..jpg|thumb|left|Slovenian Territorial Defense Units counterattacking the Yugoslav National Army tank who entered Slovenia during the [[Ten-Day War]], 1991]]\nThe initial revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated the [[Revolutions of 1989]] in Eastern Europe by almost a year, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.

There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/>\n\n=== Administrative divisions and traditional regions ===\n{{Main|Statistical regions of Slovenia|Municipalities of Slovenia}}\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"width: auto;\"\n|+ Traditional regions of Slovenia\n|-\n||[[File:Borders of the Historical Habsburgian Lands in the Republic of Slovenia.png|center|275px]]\n|-\n| <center> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''1'''</span> [[Slovene Littoral]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''Carniola:''' <br /> '''2a'''</span> [[Upper Carniola|Upper]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2b'''</span> [[Inner Carniola|Inner]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2c'''</span> [[Lower Carniola|Lower]] <br/> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''3'''</span> [[Slovene Carinthia|Carinthia]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''4'''</span> [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''5'''</span> [[Prekmurje]]</center>\n|}\n\n==== Municipalities ====\nOfficially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 [[municipalities]] (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''na\u010delnik ob\u010dinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\"/>\n\n[[File:Slovenia, administrative divisions - Nmbrs (statistical regions) - colored.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Statistical regions: 1.&nbsp;Gorizia, 2.&nbsp;Upper Carniola, 3.&nbsp;Carinthia, 4.&nbsp;Drava, 5.&nbsp;Mura, 6.&nbsp;Central Slovenia, 7.&nbsp;Central Sava, 8.&nbsp;Savinja, 9.&nbsp;Coastal\u2013Karst, 10.&nbsp;Inner Carniola\u2013Karst, 11.&nbsp;Southeast Slovenia, 12.&nbsp;Lower Sava]]\n\n==== Administrative districts ====\nThere is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia. The 62 administrative districts, officially called \"Administrative Units\" (''upravne enote''), are only subdivisions of the national government administration and are named after their respective bases of government offices.

It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"word\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' || Independent country from 1991\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century.

The anti-Nazi resistance however expanded, creating its own administrative structures as the basis for Slovene statehood within a new, federal and socialist Yugoslavia.<ref name=Tomasevich_2001>{{cite book|first=Jozo|last=Tomasevich|title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131945: Occupation and Collaboration|volume=2|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8047-3615-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC&printsec=frontcover|ref=Tomasevich_2001|pages=96\u201397}}</ref><ref name=\"Dennison I.

Slovenia joined the federation as a constituent republic, led by its own pro-Communist leadership.\n\nApproximately 8% of the entire Slovene population died during World War II. The small Jewish community, mostly settled in the [[Prekmurje]] region, perished in 1944 in the [[Holocaust in Hungary|holocaust of Hungarian Jews]]. The German speaking minority, amounting to 2.5% of the Slovenian population prior to WWII, was either expelled or killed in the aftermath of the war.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.\n\nIn September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8 |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072954/http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183414/http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> <!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which \"The Rally of Truth\" in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|accessdate=4 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archivedate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title=\"Rally of truth\" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--> On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the \"Republic of Slovenia\".<ref name=\"twenty.si\">{{cite web|author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave<!-- sic! --> Socialisti\u010dne Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |journal=Uradni List Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik]] emerged victorious.\n[[File:Teritorialci so z armbrustom zadeli tank v kri\u017ei\u0161\u010du pred MMP Ro\u017ena Dolina..jpg|thumb|left|Slovenian Territorial Defense Units counterattacking the Yugoslav National Army tank who entered Slovenia during the [[Ten-Day War]], 1991]]\nThe initial revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated the [[Revolutions of 1989]] in Eastern Europe by almost a year, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.

The average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries. Due to the rugged terrain, local vertical winds with daily periods are present. Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the [[bora (wind)|bora]], the [[jugo]], and the [[foehn wind|foehn]]. The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia.

During the first term of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

Judicial power in Slovenia is implemented by courts with general responsibilities and specialised courts that deal with matters relating to specific legal areas. The [[State's Attorney|State Prosecutor]] is an independent state authority responsible for prosecuting cases brought against those suspected of committing criminal offences. The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/>\n\n=== Administrative divisions and traditional regions ===\n{{Main|Statistical regions of Slovenia|Municipalities of Slovenia}}\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"width: auto;\"\n|+ Traditional regions of Slovenia\n|-\n||[[File:Borders of the Historical Habsburgian Lands in the Republic of Slovenia.png|center|275px]]\n|-\n| <center> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''1'''</span> [[Slovene Littoral]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''Carniola:''' <br /> '''2a'''</span> [[Upper Carniola|Upper]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2b'''</span> [[Inner Carniola|Inner]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2c'''</span> [[Lower Carniola|Lower]] <br/> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''3'''</span> [[Slovene Carinthia|Carinthia]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''4'''</span> [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''5'''</span> [[Prekmurje]]</center>\n|}\n\n==== Municipalities ====\nOfficially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 [[municipalities]] (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''na\u010delnik ob\u010dinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\"/>\n\n[[File:Slovenia, administrative divisions - Nmbrs (statistical regions) - colored.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Statistical regions: 1.&nbsp;Gorizia, 2.&nbsp;Upper Carniola, 3.&nbsp;Carinthia, 4.&nbsp;Drava, 5.&nbsp;Mura, 6.&nbsp;Central Slovenia, 7.&nbsp;Central Sava, 8.&nbsp;Savinja, 9.&nbsp;Coastal\u2013Karst, 10.&nbsp;Inner Carniola\u2013Karst, 11.&nbsp;Southeast Slovenia, 12.&nbsp;Lower Sava]]\n\n==== Administrative districts ====\nThere is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia.

Poetry in the [[Slovene language]] achieved its highest level with the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[France Pre\u0161eren]] (1800\u20131849). In the 20th century, the Slovene literary fiction went through several periods: the beginning of the century was marked by the authors of the [[Slovene Modernism]], with the most influential Slovene writer and playwright, [[Ivan Cankar]]; it was then followed by [[expressionism]] ([[Sre\u010dko Kosovel]]), avantgardism ([[Anton Podbev\u0161ek]], [[Ferdo Delak]]) and [[social realism]] ([[Ciril Kosma\u010d]], [[Pre\u017eihov Voranc]]) before World War II, the [[poetry of resistance and revolution]] ([[Karel Destovnik Kajuh]], [[Matej Bor]]) during the war, and [[intimism (Slovene poetry)|intimism]] ([[Poems of the Four]], 1953), [[Slovenian post-war modernism|post-war modernism]] ([[Edvard Kocbek]]), and [[existentialism]] ([[Dane Zajc]]) after the war.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[Postmodernism|Postmodernist]] authors include [[Boris A.

By the time of [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize. The first Slovenian hymnal, ''[[Eni Psalmi]]'', was published in 1567.

It is a processor-independent, [[multiprocessing]] and [[multi-user]] operating system.\n\nThe first version of Windows NT was [[Windows NT 3.1]] and was produced for [[workstation]]s and [[server computer]]s. It was intended to complement consumer versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] that were based on [[MS-DOS]] (including [[Windows 1.0]] through [[Windows 3.1x]]). Gradually, the Windows NT family was expanded into Microsoft's general-purpose operating system product line for all [[personal computer]]s, deprecating the [[Windows 9x]] family.\n\n\"NT\" formerly expanded to \"New Technology\" but no longer carries any specific meaning.

It is a multi-architecture operating system. Initially, it supported several [[instruction set architecture]]s, including [[IA-32]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], and [[DEC Alpha]]; support for [[PowerPC]], [[Itanium]], [[x64]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] were added later. The latest versions support [[x86]] (more specifically IA-32 and x64) and ARM.

The idea was to have a common code base with a custom [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]] (HAL) for each platform.  However, support for MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC was later dropped in Windows 2000.

Its companion product, Windows 3.1, used segmented addressing and switches from 16-bit to 32-bit addressing in pages.\n\nWindows NT 3.1 featured a core kernel providing a system API, running in [[supervisor mode]] (ring 0 in x86; referred to in Windows NT as \"kernel mode\" on all platforms), and a set of user-space environments with their own APIs which included the new Win32 environment, an OS/2 1.3 text-mode environment and a POSIX environment. The full [[preemptive multitasking]] kernel could interrupt running tasks to [[Windows NT Processor scheduling|schedule]] other tasks, without relying on user programs to voluntarily give up control of the CPU, as in Windows 3.1 Windows applications (although MS-DOS applications were preemptively multitasked in Windows starting with [[Windows 2.1x#Windows/386|Windows/386]]).\n\nNotably, in Windows NT 3.x, several I/O driver subsystems, such as video and printing, were [[user space|user-mode]] subsystems. In Windows NT 4, the video, server, and printer spooler subsystems were moved into kernel mode. Windows NT's first [[graphical user interface|GUI]] was strongly influenced by (and programmatically compatible with) that from Windows 3.1; Windows NT 4's interface was redesigned to match that of the brand new [[Windows 95]], moving from the [[Program Manager]] to the [[Windows shell]] design.\n\n[[NTFS]], a journaled, secure file system, was created for NT. Windows NT also allows for other installable file systems; starting with versions 3.1, NT could be installed on [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] or [[High Performance File System|HPFS]] file systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766145(WS.10).aspx |title=File Systems | work = TechNet | publisher = Microsoft |accessdate = November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWindows NT introduced its own driver model, the Windows NT driver model, and is incompatible with older driver frameworks.

Although they added the Win32 API, NTFS file system, GUI, and backwards compatibility with DOS, OS/2, and [[Win16]], DEC engineers almost immediately noticed the two operating systems' internal similarities; parts of ''VAX/VMS Internals and Data Structures'', published by [[Digital Press]], accurately describe Windows NT internals using VMS terms. Instead of a lawsuit, Microsoft agreed to pay DEC $65-100 million, help market VMS, train Digital personnel on Windows NT, and continue Windows NT support for DEC Alpha.{{r|russinovich19981130}}\n\nWindows NT and VMS [[memory management]], [[process (computing)|process]]es, and [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] are very similar. Windows NT's [[process management (computing)|process management]] differs by implementing [[thread (computing)|thread]]ing, which DEC did not implement until VMS 7.0 in 1995, likely to compete with Microsoft. \n\nLike VMS,{{r|russinovich19981130}} Windows NT's kernel mode code distinguishes between the \"kernel\", whose primary purpose is to implement processor- and architecture-dependent functions, and the \"executive\". This was designed as a modified [[microkernel]], as the Windows NT kernel was influenced by the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach microkernel]] developed at Carnegie Mellon University,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc768132.aspx | title = Supporting Windows NT and 2000 Workstation and Server|publisher=Prentice Hall|ISBN= 978-0-13-083068-5 | date = December 1, 1999 | accessdate= August 29, 2011 | work = Technology network}}</ref> but does not meet all of the criteria of a pure microkernel. Both the kernel and the executive are [[Linker (computing)|linked]] together into the single loaded module [[ntoskrnl.exe]]; from outside this module, there is little distinction between the kernel and the executive. Routines from each are directly accessible, as for example from kernel-mode device drivers.\n\nAPI sets in the Windows NT family are implemented as subsystems atop the publicly undocumented [[Native API|\"native\" API]]; this allowed the late adoption of the Windows API (into the Win32 subsystem). Windows NT was one of the earliest operating systems to use [[Unicode]] internally.\n\n== Releases ==\n{{see also|List of Microsoft Windows versions}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Windows NT releases\n!

It is a processor-independent, [[multiprocessing]] and [[multi-user]] operating system.\n\nThe first version of Windows NT was [[Windows NT 3.1]] and was produced for [[workstation]]s and [[server computer]]s. It was intended to complement consumer versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] that were based on [[MS-DOS]] (including [[Windows 1.0]] through [[Windows 3.1x]]). Gradually, the Windows NT family was expanded into Microsoft's general-purpose operating system product line for all [[personal computer]]s, deprecating the [[Windows 9x]] family.\n\n\"NT\" formerly expanded to \"New Technology\" but no longer carries any specific meaning.

It is a multi-architecture operating system. Initially, it supported several [[instruction set architecture]]s, including [[IA-32]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], and [[DEC Alpha]]; support for [[PowerPC]], [[Itanium]], [[x64]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] were added later. The latest versions support [[x86]] (more specifically IA-32 and x64) and ARM.

The idea was to have a common code base with a custom [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]] (HAL) for each platform.  However, support for MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC was later dropped in Windows 2000. Broad software compatibility was achieved with support for several [[Application programming interface|API]] \"personalities\", including [[Windows API]], [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem|POSIX]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_ff_x64.asp |title=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | publisher =Win super site |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> and [[OS/2]] APIs<ref>{{citation | title = MS Windows NT 4 Workstation | type = resource kit | url = http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsnt/4/workstation/reskit/en-us/os2comp.mspx?mfr=true | chapter = 28 \u2013 OS/2 Compatibility |publisher=Microsoft | accessdate = November 24, 2010}}</ref> \u2013 the latter two were phased out starting with Windows XP.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308259 | title= POSIX and OS/2 are not supported in Windows XP or in Windows Server 2003 | work =Support | publisher = Microsoft |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> Partial [[MS-DOS]] compatibility was achieved via an integrated [[NTVDM|DOS Virtual Machine]] \u2013 although this feature is being phased out in the [[x86-64]] architecture.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/1/e/81eabaf4-1907-4967-87a9-be242b1402e9/x64_Editions_Deployment.doc |title=x64 editions deployment | accessdate =November 24, 2010}}</ref> NT supported per-object (file, function, and role) [[access control list]]s allowing a rich set of security permissions to be applied to systems and services.

Its companion product, Windows 3.1, used segmented addressing and switches from 16-bit to 32-bit addressing in pages.\n\nWindows NT 3.1 featured a core kernel providing a system API, running in [[supervisor mode]] (ring 0 in x86; referred to in Windows NT as \"kernel mode\" on all platforms), and a set of user-space environments with their own APIs which included the new Win32 environment, an OS/2 1.3 text-mode environment and a POSIX environment. The full [[preemptive multitasking]] kernel could interrupt running tasks to [[Windows NT Processor scheduling|schedule]] other tasks, without relying on user programs to voluntarily give up control of the CPU, as in Windows 3.1 Windows applications (although MS-DOS applications were preemptively multitasked in Windows starting with [[Windows 2.1x#Windows/386|Windows/386]]).\n\nNotably, in Windows NT 3.x, several I/O driver subsystems, such as video and printing, were [[user space|user-mode]] subsystems. In Windows NT 4, the video, server, and printer spooler subsystems were moved into kernel mode. Windows NT's first [[graphical user interface|GUI]] was strongly influenced by (and programmatically compatible with) that from Windows 3.1; Windows NT 4's interface was redesigned to match that of the brand new [[Windows 95]], moving from the [[Program Manager]] to the [[Windows shell]] design.\n\n[[NTFS]], a journaled, secure file system, was created for NT. Windows NT also allows for other installable file systems; starting with versions 3.1, NT could be installed on [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] or [[High Performance File System|HPFS]] file systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766145(WS.10).aspx |title=File Systems | work = TechNet | publisher = Microsoft |accessdate = November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWindows NT introduced its own driver model, the Windows NT driver model, and is incompatible with older driver frameworks.

This decision caused tension between Microsoft and IBM and the collaboration ultimately fell apart. \n\nIBM continued OS/2 development alone while Microsoft continued work on the newly renamed Windows NT. Though neither operating system would immediately be as popular as Microsoft's MS-DOS or Windows products, Windows NT would eventually be far more successful than OS/2.\n\nMicrosoft hired a group of developers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] led by [[Dave Cutler]] to build Windows NT, and many elements of the design reflect earlier DEC experience with Cutler's [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]]<ref name=russinovich19981130>{{cite web | website = IT Pro | url = http://www.itprotoday.com/windows-client/windows-nt-and-vms-rest-story | title = Windows NT and VMS: The Rest of the Story | first = Mark | last = Russinovich | date = November 30, 1998 | accessdate = January 2, 2018}}</ref> and [[RSX-11]], but also an unreleased object-based operating system developed by Dave Cutler for [[DEC Prism]].<ref name=\"foreword\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/docs/Windows-NT_is_VMS_re-implemented.html\n| title=\"Windows-NT\" is \"VMS Reimplemented\" (sort of)\n| author=Neil Rieck\n| accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The team was joined by selected members of the disbanded OS/2 team, including [[Moshe Dunie]].<ref name=\"zachary\" />\n[[File:Windows_2000_architecture.svg|thumb|Windows 2000 architecture]]\nThe VMS kernel was written in [[VAX Macro]], but Windows NT was designed to run on multiple [[instruction set architectures]] and multiple hardware platforms within each architecture. The platform dependencies are hidden from the rest of the system by the [[hardware abstraction layer|HAL]] (Hardware Abstraction Layer). \n\nWhile creating Windows NT, Microsoft developers rewrote VMS in C. Although they added the Win32 API, NTFS file system, GUI, and backwards compatibility with DOS, OS/2, and [[Win16]], DEC engineers almost immediately noticed the two operating systems' internal similarities; parts of ''VAX/VMS Internals and Data Structures'', published by [[Digital Press]], accurately describe Windows NT internals using VMS terms. Instead of a lawsuit, Microsoft agreed to pay DEC $65-100 million, help market VMS, train Digital personnel on Windows NT, and continue Windows NT support for DEC Alpha.{{r|russinovich19981130}}\n\nWindows NT and VMS [[memory management]], [[process (computing)|process]]es, and [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] are very similar. Windows NT's [[process management (computing)|process management]] differs by implementing [[thread (computing)|thread]]ing, which DEC did not implement until VMS 7.0 in 1995, likely to compete with Microsoft. \n\nLike VMS,{{r|russinovich19981130}} Windows NT's kernel mode code distinguishes between the \"kernel\", whose primary purpose is to implement processor- and architecture-dependent functions, and the \"executive\". This was designed as a modified [[microkernel]], as the Windows NT kernel was influenced by the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach microkernel]] developed at Carnegie Mellon University,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc768132.aspx | title = Supporting Windows NT and 2000 Workstation and Server|publisher=Prentice Hall|ISBN= 978-0-13-083068-5 | date = December 1, 1999 | accessdate= August 29, 2011 | work = Technology network}}</ref> but does not meet all of the criteria of a pure microkernel. Both the kernel and the executive are [[Linker (computing)|linked]] together into the single loaded module [[ntoskrnl.exe]]; from outside this module, there is little distinction between the kernel and the executive. Routines from each are directly accessible, as for example from kernel-mode device drivers.\n\nAPI sets in the Windows NT family are implemented as subsystems atop the publicly undocumented [[Native API|\"native\" API]]; this allowed the late adoption of the Windows API (into the Win32 subsystem). Windows NT was one of the earliest operating systems to use [[Unicode]] internally.\n\n== Releases ==\n{{see also|List of Microsoft Windows versions}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Windows NT releases\n!

It did not receive the immediate mass support from the Untouchable population that Ambedkar had hoped for. Division and lack of direction among the leaders of the Ambedkarite movement have been an additional impediment. According to the 2011 census, there are currently 8.44 million Buddhists in India, at least 6.5 million of whom are [[Marathi Buddhists]] in Maharashtra.<ref name=\"Census of India 2001\">[http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm Census GIS HouseHold<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706213221/http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm |date=6 July 2010 }}</ref> This makes Buddhism the fifth-largest [[religion in India]] and 6% of the population of [[Maharashtra]], but less than 1% of the overall population of India.\n\nThe Buddhist revival remains concentrated in two [[States and territories of India|states]]: Ambedkar's native [[Maharashtra]], and [[Uttar Pradesh]] \u2013 the land of Bodhanand Mahastavir, Acharya Medharthi and their associates.\n\n===Developments in Uttar Pradesh===\n[[File:B.R.

He joined the Republican Party of India and converted to Buddhism along with his whole family in 1961. In 1967, he founded the Kanpur branch of \"Bharatiya Buddh Mahasabha\". He held regular meetings where he preached Buddhism, officiated at Buddhist weddings and life cycle ceremonies, and organised festivals on Ambedkar's Jayanti (birth day), [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]], Diksha Divas (the day Ambedkar converted), and Ambedkar Paranirvan Divas (the day Ambedkar died).<ref name=\"maren_roots\"/>\n\nThe Dalit Buddhist movement in Kanpur gained impetus with the arrival of Dipankar, a [[Chamar]] bhikkhu, in 1980. Dipankar had come to Kanpur on a Buddhist mission and his first public appearance was scheduled at a mass conversion drive in 1981. The event was organised by Rahulan Ambawadekar, an RPI Dalit leader. In April 1981, Ambawadekar founded the Dalit Panthers (U.P. Branch) inspired by the Maharashtrian Dalit Panthers.

Sasai came to India in 1966 and met [[Nichidatsu Fujii]], whom he helped with the Peace Pagoda at [[Rajgir]]. He fell out with Fuji, however, and started home, but, by his own account, was stopped by a dream in which a figure resembling [[Nagarjuna]] appeared and said, \"Go to Nagpur\". In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organised the conversion ceremony for Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of Ambedkar at Godbole's home, he realised that it was Ambedkar who had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur folk considered Surai Sasai very strange. Then he began to greet them with \"[[Jai Bhim]]\" (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas.  In 1987 a court case to deport him on the grounds that he had overstayed his [[Visa (document)|visa]] was dismissed, and he was granted Indian citizenship.

It is the Indian wing of the UK-based [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] founded by [[Sangharakshita]]. Its roots lie in the scattered contacts that [[Sangharakshita]] had in the 1950s with Ambedkar.  Sangharakshita, then still a bhikshu, participated in the conversion movement from 1956 until his departure to the UK in 1963.\n\nWhen his new ecumenical movement had gained enough ground in the West, Sangharakshita worked with Ambedkarites in India and the UK to develop Indian Buddhism further. After visits in the late 1970s by Dharmachari Lokamitra from UK, supporters developed a two-pronged approach: social work through the Bahujan Hitaj (also spelled as Bahujan Hitay) trust, mainly sponsored from the general public by the British Buddhist-inspired [[Karuna Trust (UK)]], and direct Dharma work. Currently the movement has viharas and groups in at least 20 major areas, a couple of retreat centres, and hundreds of Indian Dharmacharis and Dharmacharinis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD+Spring+2011_Senauke.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=20 April 2012|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420003928/http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD%20Spring%202011_Senauke.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFunding for movement's social and dharma work has come from foreign countries, including the Western countries and [[Taiwan]].

It did not receive the immediate mass support from the Untouchable population that Ambedkar had hoped for. Division and lack of direction among the leaders of the Ambedkarite movement have been an additional impediment. According to the 2011 census, there are currently 8.44 million Buddhists in India, at least 6.5 million of whom are [[Marathi Buddhists]] in Maharashtra.<ref name=\"Census of India 2001\">[http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm Census GIS HouseHold<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706213221/http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm |date=6 July 2010 }}</ref> This makes Buddhism the fifth-largest [[religion in India]] and 6% of the population of [[Maharashtra]], but less than 1% of the overall population of India.\n\nThe Buddhist revival remains concentrated in two [[States and territories of India|states]]: Ambedkar's native [[Maharashtra]], and [[Uttar Pradesh]] \u2013 the land of Bodhanand Mahastavir, Acharya Medharthi and their associates.\n\n===Developments in Uttar Pradesh===\n[[File:B.R.

He joined the Republican Party of India and converted to Buddhism along with his whole family in 1961. In 1967, he founded the Kanpur branch of \"Bharatiya Buddh Mahasabha\". He held regular meetings where he preached Buddhism, officiated at Buddhist weddings and life cycle ceremonies, and organised festivals on Ambedkar's Jayanti (birth day), [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]], Diksha Divas (the day Ambedkar converted), and Ambedkar Paranirvan Divas (the day Ambedkar died).<ref name=\"maren_roots\"/>\n\nThe Dalit Buddhist movement in Kanpur gained impetus with the arrival of Dipankar, a [[Chamar]] bhikkhu, in 1980. Dipankar had come to Kanpur on a Buddhist mission and his first public appearance was scheduled at a mass conversion drive in 1981. The event was organised by Rahulan Ambawadekar, an RPI Dalit leader. In April 1981, Ambawadekar founded the Dalit Panthers (U.P. Branch) inspired by the Maharashtrian Dalit Panthers.

Sasai came to India in 1966 and met [[Nichidatsu Fujii]], whom he helped with the Peace Pagoda at [[Rajgir]]. He fell out with Fuji, however, and started home, but, by his own account, was stopped by a dream in which a figure resembling [[Nagarjuna]] appeared and said, \"Go to Nagpur\". In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organised the conversion ceremony for Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of Ambedkar at Godbole's home, he realised that it was Ambedkar who had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur folk considered Surai Sasai very strange. Then he began to greet them with \"[[Jai Bhim]]\" (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas.  In 1987 a court case to deport him on the grounds that he had overstayed his [[Visa (document)|visa]] was dismissed, and he was granted Indian citizenship.

It is the Indian wing of the UK-based [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] founded by [[Sangharakshita]]. Its roots lie in the scattered contacts that [[Sangharakshita]] had in the 1950s with Ambedkar.  Sangharakshita, then still a bhikshu, participated in the conversion movement from 1956 until his departure to the UK in 1963.\n\nWhen his new ecumenical movement had gained enough ground in the West, Sangharakshita worked with Ambedkarites in India and the UK to develop Indian Buddhism further. After visits in the late 1970s by Dharmachari Lokamitra from UK, supporters developed a two-pronged approach: social work through the Bahujan Hitaj (also spelled as Bahujan Hitay) trust, mainly sponsored from the general public by the British Buddhist-inspired [[Karuna Trust (UK)]], and direct Dharma work. Currently the movement has viharas and groups in at least 20 major areas, a couple of retreat centres, and hundreds of Indian Dharmacharis and Dharmacharinis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD+Spring+2011_Senauke.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=20 April 2012|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420003928/http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD%20Spring%202011_Senauke.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFunding for movement's social and dharma work has come from foreign countries, including the Western countries and [[Taiwan]].

Typically, the DNA transferred consists of the genes required to make and transfer pili (often encoded on a [[plasmid]]), and so is a kind of [[selfish DNA]]; however, other pieces of DNA are often co-transferred and this can result in dissemination of genetic traits throughout a bacterial population, such as [[antibiotic resistance]].
