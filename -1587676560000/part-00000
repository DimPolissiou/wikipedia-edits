{"title_page": "List of major opera composers", "text_new": "This list provides a guide to '''[[opera]] [[composers]]''', as determined by their presence on a majority of compiled lists of significant opera composers. (See the [[#Lists consulted|\"Lists Consulted\" section]] for full details.) The composers run from [[Jacopo Peri]], who wrote the first ever opera in late 16th century Italy, to [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]], one of the leading figures in the contemporary operatic world. The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each composer has been considered major. Also included is a section about major women opera composers, compiled from the same lists. For an introduction to operatic history, see [[opera]]. The organisation of the list is by birthdate.\n\n== Major opera composers ==\n=== 1550\u20131699 ===\n[[Image:Jacopo Peri 1.jpg|thumb|[[Jacopo Peri]] as Arion in ''La pellegrina'']]<onlyinclude>\n* '''[[Jacopo Peri]]''' (1561\u20131633).

However \"Orfeo\" has much broader roots. There are many references to the tradition of the Florentine intermedi: the spectacular stage effects, the mythological subject matter, the allegorical figures, the number and scoring of the instruments and the extended choruses\"''. See also Carter, writing about the intermedi in ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (p. 4): ''\"rich display and erudite symbolism made the intermedi an ideal projection of princely magnificence\"''.</ref> Later, in Venice in the 1640s, he helped make opera a commercially viable form with ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', one of the earliest operas in the present-day operatic repertoire.\n* '''[[Francesco Cavalli]]''' (1602\u20131676). Amongst the most important of Monteverdi's successors, Cavalli was a major force in spreading opera throughout Italy and also helped introduce it to France. His ''[[Giasone]]'' was ''\" the most popular opera of the 17th century\".''<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 189</ref>\n* '''[[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]''' (1632\u20131687). In close collaboration with the librettist [[Philippe Quinault]], Lully founded the tradition of ''[[trag\u00e9die en musique]]'',<ref>Orrey p. 35</ref> combining singing, dance and visual spectacle, which would remain the most prestigious French operatic genre for almost a hundred years. ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'' (1673) is often regarded as the first example of [[French opera]].\n* '''[[Henry Purcell]]''' (1659\u20131695). Purcell was the first English operatic composer of significance. His masterwork is ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''.<ref>Orrey p. 55</ref>\n* '''[[Alessandro Scarlatti]]''' (1660\u20131725). A key figure in the development of [[opera seria]], Scarlatti claimed to have composed over 100 operas, of which ''[[Griselda (A. Scarlatti)|La Griselda]]'' is a notable example.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 942</ref></onlyinclude>\n* '''[[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]''' (1683\u20131764) was the most important French opera composer of the 18th century. Following in the genre established by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]],<ref name=\"Orrey p. 40\">Orrey p. 40</ref> he endowed his works with a great richness of invention. Rameau's musical daring provoked great controversy in his day,<ref name=\"Orrey p. 40\"/> but he was an important influence on [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]].\n* '''[[Johann Christoph Pepusch]]''' (1667\u20131752). Arranger of the first English [[ballad opera]], the biting political satire, ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 343</ref>\n* '''[[George Frideric Handel]]''' (1685\u20131759). Handel's  ''[[opera seria|opera serie]]'' set the standard in his day.<ref name=\"Orrey p. 59\">Orrey p. 59</ref> Handel composed a series of over 30 operas.\n\n=== 1700\u201399 ===\n[[File:Joseph Siffred Duplessis - Christoph Willibald Gluck - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Gluck in a 1775 portrait by [[Joseph Duplessis]].]]\n* '''[[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]''' (1710\u20131736). Though Pergolesi also composed [[opera seria]]s, his most influential work was the short [[opera buffa]], ''[[La serva padrona]]''.<ref>''Oxford Companion to Music'', p. 783</ref>\n* '''[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]''' (1714\u20131787) was a key figure in the transformation of Baroque into Classical opera, paving the way for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], though his influence stretched much further into the 19th century, with both [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] acknowledging their debt to him. In his ''reform operas'' from ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' onwards, he sought to throw off the formal conventions of ''[[opera seria]]'' and write music of \"beautiful simplicity\" (his own words).<ref>Orrey p. 85</ref>\n* '''[[Giovanni Paisiello]]''' (1740\u20131816). Italian composer who wrote the first opera to include [[Pierre Beaumarchais|Beaumarchais]]' character Figaro as a main character, as well as writing a substantial number of other operas, some of them in St. Petersburg.\n* '''[[Andr\u00e9 Ernest Modeste Gr\u00e9try]]''' (1741\u20131813). [[Li\u00e8ge]] (present day [[Belgium|Belgian]]) composer crucial to the development of [[France|French]] ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]'', whose simplicity of musical style and sophisticated dramaturgy were immensely popular, as well as linking pre-revolutionary [[Rococo (music)|rococo]] comedy to the later [[Romantic music|romantic]] style. \n* '''[[Domenico Cimarosa]]''' (1749\u20131801). Italian composer most famous for the [[opera buffa]], ''[[Il matrimonio segreto]]'', which forms a bridge between the comedies of [[Mozart]] and [[Rossini]].<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' pp. 216\u2013218</ref>\n* '''[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]''' (1756\u20131791). Mozart's series of comic collaborations (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'') with [[Lorenzo da Ponte]] are among the most popular operas in the repertoire today,<ref>Orrey p. 101</ref> along with his [[Singspiel]] ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n*'''[[Antonio Salieri]]''' (1750\u20131825). Italian composer who was a major contributor to and shaper of Viennese musical life from 1770 to 1820, he also composed successful operas in Italy and Paris, and won admiration from German operagoers as a composer who, in the words of one contemporary critic, \u2018could bind all the power of German music to the sweet Italian style\u2019.<ref>JANE SCHATKIN HETTRICK, JOHN A. RICE 'Salieri, Antonio' in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''.</ref> His opera ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]'' was composed for the inauguration of [[La Scala]]. Among his other most successful operas were ''[[Les Dana\u00efdes]]'', ''[[Axur, re d'Ormus]]'' (the Italian version of French ''[[Tarare (opera)|Tarare]]'') and ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]''.\n* '''[[Luigi Cherubini]]''' (1760\u20131842). A follower of [[Gluck]], Cherubini's most famous opera is ''[[M\u00e9d\u00e9e (Cherubini)|M\u00e9d\u00e9e]]''. The title role has proved a challenge to sopranos (including [[Maria Callas]]) since its premiere in 1797.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 210</ref>\n* '''[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]''' (1770\u20131827) wrote only one opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'', a tale of freedom from political oppression, which has become one of the major [[Opera in German|German language operas]].<ref>Orrey p. 139</ref>\n* '''[[Gaspare Spontini]]''' (1774\u20131851). Though Italian, Spontini is best known for his work in France during the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic era]]. His masterpiece ''[[La vestale]]'' influenced [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Berlioz]].<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 1002</ref>\n* '''[[Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber]]''' (1782\u20131871). French composer celebrated for high-spirited ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]s'' such as ''[[Fra Diavolo (opera)|Fra Diavolo]]'' and ''[[Le domino noir]]''. His grand opera ''[[La muette de Portici]]'' attained unexpected political influence when a performance in [[Brussels]] in 1830 sparked off a revolution which led to the creation of Belgium.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n* '''[[Carl Maria von Weber]]''' (1786\u20131826) founded [[German romanticism|German Romantic]] opera<ref>Orrey p. 140</ref> in order to challenge the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. A master of orchestral colour and atmosphere, Weber was never well served by his librettists, and only one of his works, ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'', is performed with any frequency. Though he died young, his influence on later German composers, especially [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], was immense.\n* '''[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]''' (1791\u20131864). The archetypal composer of French [[grand opera]], Meyerbeer's huge extravaganzas such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' and ''[[Le proph\u00e8te]]'' were immensely popular in their day.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' pp. 146\u2013150</ref>\n* '''[[Gioachino Rossini]]''' (1792\u20131868) links [[bel canto]] with [[Grand Opera]]. His immortal ''[[Barber of Seville]]'' was the only one of his operas that was continuously performed into the 20th century,<ref name=\"Britannica p. 631 C.2\">Britannica p. 631 C.2</ref> but his serious operas, such as ''[[Semiramide]]'' and ''[[Ermione]]'', are recognised as masterpieces now that singers with appropriate technique are again available to perform them. ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'', his swan-song, has a vast sweep<ref name=\"Britannica p. 631 C.2\"/> only equalled in the 19th century by the later works of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].\n*'''[[Heinrich Marschner]]''' (1795\u20131861). German composer who was the most important exponent of German Romantic opera in the generation between Weber and Wagner.<ref>A. DEAN PALMER 'Marschner, Heinrich August' in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''.</ref> His most successful operas were ''[[Hans Heiling]]'', ''[[Der Vampyr]]'' and ''[[Der Templer und die J\u00fcdin]]''.\n* '''[[Gaetano Donizetti]]''' (1797\u20131848). Along with [[Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], Donizetti is generally acknowledged as one of the masters of the ''bel canto'' style. His masterwork is generally cited as being ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.<ref>Orrey p. 134</ref>\n* '''[[Jacques Fromental Hal\u00e9vy]]''' (1799\u20131862). Along with [[Meyerbeer]], the best known composer of French [[grand opera]], Hal\u00e9vy's key work is ''[[La Juive]]'', a story of religious intolerance set in 15th century Switzerland.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 412</ref>\n\n=== 1800\u201349 ===\n[[Image:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886 (National Gallery of Modern Art, Rome)]]\n* '''[[Vincenzo Bellini]]''' (1801\u20131835). On account of such works as ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and ''[[I puritani]]'', Bellini is recognised as one of the leading composers of the ''bel canto'' style of opera.<ref>Orrey pp. 129\u2013133</ref>\n* '''[[Hector Berlioz]]''' (1803\u20131869). Berlioz's attempts to carve out an operatic career for himself were thwarted by an unimaginative musical establishment.<ref>Orrey p. 153</ref> Nevertheless, he managed to produce ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', ''[[B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict]]'' and his masterpiece, the epic ''[[Les Troyens]]'',.<ref name=\"Orrey p. 154\">Orrey p. 154</ref> Berlioz's ''dramatic legend'', ''[[La Damnation de Faust]]'', has also been staged as an opera in recent years.\n* '''[[Mikhail Glinka]]''' (1804\u20131857) founded the Russian operatic tradition with his historical drama ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' and his fairy tale piece ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]''.<ref>Orrey p. 180</ref>\n* '''[[Ambroise Thomas]]''' (1811\u20131896). French composer noted for the operas ''[[Mignon]]'' and ''[[Hamlet (opera)|Hamlet]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 1098.</ref>\n* '''[[Richard Wagner]]''' (1813\u20131883). Wagner revolutionised opera. In a series of \"music dramas\" such as ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'', and most of all his epic tetralogy ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', Wagner abolished the traditional distinction between [[recitative]] and [[aria]] and pioneered a new through-composed style of opera.<ref>Orrey pp. 168\u2013169</ref>\n* '''[[Giuseppe Verdi]]''' (1813\u20131901) had a long composing career, during which his compositional style kept evolving.

Mussorgsky completed only one opera, but ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' proved to be inspiration for generations of Russian composers on account of its uniquely nationalist character.<ref name=\"Britannica p. 637 C.2\">Britannica p. 637 C.2</ref>\n* '''[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]''' (1840\u20131893). Tchaikovsky's international fame as an opera composer mainly rests on two works, ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''.<ref>Orrey p. 182</ref> Less interested in cultivating a uniquely Russian style than his contemporary [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], Tchaikovsky also shows the influence of [[Mozart]], [[bel canto]] and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' in these pieces.<ref>David Brown (author of the four-volume ''Tchaikovsky: A Biographical and Critical Study'', Gollancz, 1978\u201391) in ''Viking Opera Guide'', pp. 1083\u20131095</ref>\n* '''[[Emmanuel Chabrier]]''' (1841\u20131894) had ambitions to write grand operas in the Wagnerian vein, but is now most celebrated for lighter pieces, such as ''[[L'\u00e9toile (opera)|L'\u00e9toile]]'' and ''[[Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui]]'', which were greatly admired by Ravel and Poulenc.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 197</ref>\n* '''[[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]''' (1841\u20131904) was the leading Czech opera composer between [[Smetana]] and [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek|Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]. His ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', based on the [[Ondine (mythology)|Undine]] legend, is his most popular work internationally.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 302</ref>\n* '''[[Jules Massenet]]''' (1842\u20131912). Arguably the most representative French opera composer of his era (the ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]''), Massenet was a prolific and versatile writer whose works cover a wide variety of themes.<ref>Orrey p. 156</ref> His popularity faded somewhat after the First World War, but ''[[Werther]]'' and ''[[Manon]]'' still make regular appearances in the opera house.<ref>Graham Dixon in ''Viking Opera Guide'', p. 622</ref>\n* '''[[Arthur Sullivan]]''' (1842\u20131900).

Jan\u00e1\u010dek's first mature opera (''[[Jen\u016ffa]]'') blended folksong-like melodies and an emphasis on natural speech-rhythms \u00e0 la [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]] with a character-driven plot of some intensity;<ref>Britannica p. 638 C.2</ref> his later works became increasingly terse, with recurrent melodic fragments, lyrical outbursts and unconventional orchestration serving a diverse collection of source-material \u2013 just a few bars of these operas can instantly be identified as his.\n* '''[[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]]''' (1857\u20131919) Italian composer associated with [[verismo]].

French composer famous for a single opera, ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'', set in a working class district of Paris.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' pp. 202\u2013204</ref>\n* '''[[Claude Debussy]]''' (1862\u20131918). Like [[Beethoven]], Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of [[Maeterlinck]]'s [[Symbolist]] play ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'' is a key work in 20th century music drama.<ref>Orrey p. 216</ref> In many ways an \"anti-opera\", ''Pell\u00e9as'' contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the premi\u00e8re had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream-like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate (or repel) listeners today.\n* '''[[Pietro Mascagni]]''' (1863\u20131945). Italian composer, famous above all for ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', usually given in a double-bill with Leoncavallo's ''[[Pagliacci]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 617</ref>\n* '''[[Richard Strauss]]''' (1864\u20131949). Strauss was one of very few opera composers in the early years of the 20th century to accept and conquer the challenge laid down by the scale and radical nature of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s innovative works.<ref>Orrey p. 213</ref> He composed several operas that remain extremely popular today, including ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.<ref name=\"Britannica p. 637 C.2\"/>\n* '''[[Hans Pfitzner]]''' (1869\u20131949).

Like [[Shostakovich]], Prokofiev suffered under the Soviet artistic regime, but his work has recently been championed by conductors such as [[Valery Gergiev]].\n* '''[[Paul Hindemith]]''' (1895\u20131963). A German composer who came to prominence in the years following World War I.

Shostakovich's most famous opera, ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', a violent love story set in provincial Russia, scandalised Soviet authorities. He later produced a revised version, ''[[Katerina Ismailova]]''. Nevertheless, the original became one of the most performed operatic works of the 20th century.<ref>Orrey p. 232</ref>\n* '''[[Samuel Barber]]''' (1910\u20131981).

One of the handful of British opera composers to reach international acclaim, and one of the extremely few composers of 20th century operas that stayed in the standard repertory after their premieres.

However \"Orfeo\" has much broader roots. There are many references to the tradition of the Florentine intermedi: the spectacular stage effects, the mythological subject matter, the allegorical figures, the number and scoring of the instruments and the extended choruses\"''. See also Carter, writing about the intermedi in ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (p. 4): ''\"rich display and erudite symbolism made the intermedi an ideal projection of princely magnificence\"''.</ref> Later, in Venice in the 1640s, he helped make opera a commercially viable form with ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', one of the earliest operas in the present-day operatic repertoire.\n* '''[[Francesco Cavalli]]''' (1602\u20131676). Amongst the most important of Monteverdi's successors, Cavalli was a major force in spreading opera throughout Italy and also helped introduce it to France.

In close collaboration with the librettist [[Philippe Quinault]], Lully founded the tradition of ''[[trag\u00e9die en musique]]'',<ref>Orrey p. 35</ref> combining singing, dance and visual spectacle, which would remain the most prestigious French operatic genre for almost a hundred years. ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'' (1673) is often regarded as the first example of [[French opera]].\n* '''[[Henry Purcell]]''' (1659\u20131695). Purcell was the first English operatic composer of significance. His masterwork is ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''.<ref>Orrey p. 55</ref>\n* '''[[Alessandro Scarlatti]]''' (1660\u20131725).

In his ''reform operas'' from ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' onwards, he sought to throw off the formal conventions of ''[[opera seria]]'' and write music of \"beautiful simplicity\" (his own words).<ref>Orrey p. 85</ref>\n* '''[[Giovanni Paisiello]]''' (1740\u20131816).

[[Li\u00e8ge]] (present day [[Belgium|Belgian]]) composer crucial to the development of [[France|French]] ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]'', whose simplicity of musical style and sophisticated dramaturgy were immensely popular, as well as linking pre-revolutionary [[Rococo (music)|rococo]] comedy to the later [[Romantic music|romantic]] style. \n* '''[[Domenico Cimarosa]]''' (1749\u20131801).

Italian composer who was a major contributor to and shaper of Viennese musical life from 1770 to 1820, he also composed successful operas in Italy and Paris, and won admiration from German operagoers as a composer who, in the words of one contemporary critic, \u2018could bind all the power of German music to the sweet Italian style\u2019.<ref>JANE SCHATKIN HETTRICK, JOHN A. RICE 'Salieri, Antonio' in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''.</ref> His opera ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]'' was composed for the inauguration of [[La Scala]].

His grand opera ''[[La muette de Portici]]'' attained unexpected political influence when a performance in [[Brussels]] in 1830 sparked off a revolution which led to the creation of Belgium.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n* '''[[Carl Maria von Weber]]''' (1786\u20131826) founded [[German romanticism|German Romantic]] opera<ref>Orrey p. 140</ref> in order to challenge the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. A master of orchestral colour and atmosphere, Weber was never well served by his librettists, and only one of his works, ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'', is performed with any frequency. Though he died young, his influence on later German composers, especially [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], was immense.\n* '''[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]''' (1791\u20131864).

Mussorgsky completed only one opera, but ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' proved to be inspiration for generations of Russian composers on account of its uniquely nationalist character.<ref name=\"Britannica p. 637 C.2\">Britannica p. 637 C.2</ref>\n* '''[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]''' (1840\u20131893). Tchaikovsky's international fame as an opera composer mainly rests on two works, ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''.<ref>Orrey p. 182</ref> Less interested in cultivating a uniquely Russian style than his contemporary [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], Tchaikovsky also shows the influence of [[Mozart]], [[bel canto]] and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' in these pieces.<ref>David Brown (author of the four-volume ''Tchaikovsky: A Biographical and Critical Study'', Gollancz, 1978\u201391) in ''Viking Opera Guide'', pp. 1083\u20131095</ref>\n* '''[[Emmanuel Chabrier]]''' (1841\u20131894) had ambitions to write grand operas in the Wagnerian vein, but is now most celebrated for lighter pieces, such as ''[[L'\u00e9toile (opera)|L'\u00e9toile]]'' and ''[[Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui]]'', which were greatly admired by Ravel and Poulenc.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 197</ref>\n* '''[[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]''' (1841\u20131904) was the leading Czech opera composer between [[Smetana]] and [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek|Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]. His ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', based on the [[Ondine (mythology)|Undine]] legend, is his most popular work internationally.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 302</ref>\n* '''[[Jules Massenet]]''' (1842\u20131912). Arguably the most representative French opera composer of his era (the ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]''), Massenet was a prolific and versatile writer whose works cover a wide variety of themes.<ref>Orrey p. 156</ref> His popularity faded somewhat after the First World War, but ''[[Werther]]'' and ''[[Manon]]'' still make regular appearances in the opera house.<ref>Graham Dixon in ''Viking Opera Guide'', p. 622</ref>\n* '''[[Arthur Sullivan]]''' (1842\u20131900). English composer who is best known for his series of 14 operatic collaborations with the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], including such enduring works as ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]''.\n* '''[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]''' (1844\u20131908).

Jan\u00e1\u010dek's first mature opera (''[[Jen\u016ffa]]'') blended folksong-like melodies and an emphasis on natural speech-rhythms \u00e0 la [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]] with a character-driven plot of some intensity;<ref>Britannica p. 638 C.2</ref> his later works became increasingly terse, with recurrent melodic fragments, lyrical outbursts and unconventional orchestration serving a diverse collection of source-material \u2013 just a few bars of these operas can instantly be identified as his.\n* '''[[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]]''' (1857\u20131919) Italian composer associated with [[verismo]].

Like [[Beethoven]], Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of [[Maeterlinck]]'s [[Symbolist]] play ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'' is a key work in 20th century music drama.<ref>Orrey p. 216</ref> In many ways an \"anti-opera\", ''Pell\u00e9as'' contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the premi\u00e8re had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream-like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate (or repel) listeners today.\n* '''[[Pietro Mascagni]]''' (1863\u20131945). Italian composer, famous above all for ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', usually given in a double-bill with Leoncavallo's ''[[Pagliacci]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 617</ref>\n* '''[[Richard Strauss]]''' (1864\u20131949). Strauss was one of very few opera composers in the early years of the 20th century to accept and conquer the challenge laid down by the scale and radical nature of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s innovative works.<ref>Orrey p. 213</ref> He composed several operas that remain extremely popular today, including ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.<ref name=\"Britannica p. 637 C.2\"/>\n* '''[[Hans Pfitzner]]''' (1869\u20131949).

A leading Modernist composer and the deviser of the twelve-tone system, Schoenberg began his operatic career with the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] monodrama ''[[Erwartung]]''. His major opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' was left unfinished at his death.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 952</ref>\n* '''[[Maurice Ravel]]''' (1875\u20131937) wrote two short, but innovative, operas: ''[[L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges]]'', set in the world of childhood, and the Spanish-flavoured ''[[L'heure espagnole]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 848</ref>\n* '''[[Franz Schreker]]''' (1878\u20131934). An Austrian composer associated with [[Expressionism (music)|Expressionism]], Schreker once rivalled [[Richard Strauss]] in popularity but, as a Jew, he fell foul of the Nazis. His operas include ''[[Der ferne Klang]]'' and ''[[Die Gezeichneten]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 958</ref>\n* '''[[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]''' (1881\u20131945) wrote only one opera, ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]'', a key piece in 20th century music theatre and the only Hungarian work with a secure place in the international operatic repertoire.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 55</ref>\n* '''[[Igor Stravinsky]]''' (1882\u20131971). After composing the [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]-inspired ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' and the near-operas ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' and ''[[Histoire du Soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'', Stravinsky bucked 20th century trends by composing a \"number\" opera, ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', using diatonicism.<ref>Orrey p. 220</ref>\n* '''[[Alban Berg]]''' (1885\u20131935).

A major modern composer in the Russian tradition,<ref>Britannica p. 637 C.1</ref> Prokofiev produced operas on a wide variety of subjects, from the comic fairy-tale ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', to the dark and occult ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'' and the epic ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''. Like [[Shostakovich]], Prokofiev suffered under the Soviet artistic regime, but his work has recently been championed by conductors such as [[Valery Gergiev]].\n* '''[[Paul Hindemith]]''' (1895\u20131963). A German composer who came to prominence in the years following World War I. His key opera ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'', dealing with the problems of an artist in a time of crisis, has been seen as an allegory of Hindemith's situation during the Third Reich.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 467</ref>\n* '''[[George Gershwin]]''' (1898\u20131937) owes his place in the standard operatic repertoire to ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 348</ref>\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n* '''[[William Walton]]''' (1902\u20131983).

They include ''[[The Midsummer Marriage]]'' and ''[[The Knot Garden]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 1102</ref>\n* '''[[Dmitri Shostakovich]]''' (1906\u20131975). Shostakovich's most famous opera, ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', a violent love story set in provincial Russia, scandalised Soviet authorities. He later produced a revised version, ''[[Katerina Ismailova]]''. Nevertheless, the original became one of the most performed operatic works of the 20th century.<ref>Orrey p. 232</ref>\n* '''[[Samuel Barber]]''' (1910\u20131981). An American who composed two major operas, ''[[Vanessa (opera)|Vanessa]]'' and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (opera)|Antony and Cleopatra]]''.<ref>''Viking Opera Guide'' p. 51</ref>\n* '''[[Gian Carlo Menotti]]''' (1911\u20132007).

The programme is fronted by ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' presenter [[Huw Edwards]], the BBC's lead presenter for major breaking news, from Monday to Thursday and [[Jane Hill]] on Friday<!-- Do not add weekend presenters, the branded News at Five only runs on weekdays -->. The show includes a detailed look at the news, as well as analysis with guests and sport and weather updates.\n\nUnlike most other BBC News Channel bulletins, the ''BBC News at Five'' is presented from Studio C, which is usually the main studio for BBC World News.\n\n==Weekends and Bank Holidays==\nDuring weekends and bank holidays, BBC News at Five resembles an unbranded BBC News channel bulletin, usually lasting for 30 minutes. As the main evening news on Saturday is normally at 17:30, when the main news isn't the back half hour is filled with a sports bulletin and ''The Film Review''.  It presented from the News Channel's main studio, studio E. \n\n== History ==\n\nThe programme started on 3 April 2006 as part of the BBC's relaunch of BBC News presenters, which saw the introduction of the new flagship programme to compete against [[Jeremy Thompson]]'s ''[[Live at Five (Sky News programme)|Live at Five]]'' programme on rival channel [[Sky News]], and to improve BBC News ratings for the hour.\n\nAs part of the 2008 revamp of the entire news output, the show moved studios within [[BBC Television Centre]] along with [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] and the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' bulletins. The show originally broadcast from Studio N8 but moved to Studio N6.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the programme moved to [[Broadcasting House]] along with BBC News and the BBC One bulletins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html |title=BBC News' television output moves to new studios at Broadcasting House |publisher=BBC |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref> On 4 November 2013, the ''BBC News at Five'' received new opening titles featuring the hour of broadcast.\n\n== Outside broadcasts ==\n\nAs well as presenting from the studio, the main presenters are called upon to present on location when major stories break. For example, [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] presented live from the BBC's Washington Studio for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 US Presidential Elections and has presented live from Basra from the withdrawal ceremony. [[George Alagiah]] presented from L'Aquila in April 2009 and Haiti in January 2010 when earthquakes struck the countries. During the 2015 Election campaign Edwards presented from across the UK, while [[Gavin Esler]] was based in Edinburgh and [[Clive Myrie]] served as the London presenter.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Presenters ==\n<!-- Do not add weekend presenters, the branded News at Five only runs on weekdays -->\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#9A0000\" align=\"center\"\n! <span style=\"color:white\">Years</span> !! <span style=\"color:white\">Presenter</span> !! <span style=\"color:white\">Current role</span> \n|-\n| 2006\u2013present || [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] || Main Presenter (Monday\u2013Thursday)\n|-\n| 2013\u2013present ||[[Jane Hill]]|| Main Presenter (Friday)\n|-\n| 2006\u2013present ||[[Ben Brown (journalist)|Ben Brown]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Regular Relief Presenters\n|-\n| 2010\u2013present || [[Clive Myrie]]\n|-\n| 2006\u2013present || [[Julian Worricker]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Occasional Relief Presenters\n|-\n| 2016\u2013present || [[Christian Fraser]]\n|- \n| 2017\u2013present || [[Reeta Chakrabarti]]\n|-\n| 2017-present || [[Shaun Ley]]\n|- \n| 2018-present || [[Carole Walker]]\n|-\n| 2018-present || [[Martine Croxall]]\n|-\n| 2018-present || Rebecca Jones\n|-\n|2019-present\n|[[Carrie Gracie]]\n|}\n\n=== Former presenters ===\nIf there is no position before the years of being a presenter, then this newsreader was either a relief presenter or occasional guest stand-in presenter.\n\n* [[Gavin Esler]] (Deputy presenter, 2006\u20132017)\n* [[Peter Sissons]] (2006\u20132009)\n* [[Emily Maitlis]] (2007\u20132016)\n* [[Louise Minchin]] (2007\u20132011)\n* [[Nicholas Owen (journalist)|Nicholas Owen]] (2008\u20132017)\n* [[Tim Willcox]] (2008\u20132015)\n* [[Joanna Gosling]] (2009\u20132010)\n* [[Jon Sopel]] (2009\u20132012)\n* [[Zeinab Badawi]] (2011)\n* [[Sophie Long]] (2011\u20132012)\n* Annita McVeigh (2013\u20132017)\n* [[Matthew Price]] (2015)\n* [[Maxine Mawhinney]] (2015\u20132016)\n* [[Simon McCoy]] (2015\u20132017)\n\n== Format ==\n\nGenerally the program follows a standard format as follows -\n\n* 17:00 \u2013 Headlines\n* 17:00\u201317:15 \u2013 Stories\n* 17:15 \u2013 Headlines\n* 17:15\u201317:25 \u2013 Interview, in-depth analysis\n* 17:25\u201317:30 \u2013 Weather\n* 17:30 \u2013 Headlines\n* 17:30\u201317:45 \u2013 Stories with sports round-up (except on Friday)\n* 17:45 \u2013 Headlines (except on Friday for a look ahead to [[Sportsday]])\n* 17:45\u201317:55 \u2013 Interview, in-depth analysis (except on Friday for [[The Film Review]])\n* 17:55\u201318:00 \u2013 Weather\n\nThe weather updates are generally presented from the screen away from the main desk.

The programme is fronted by ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' presenter [[Huw Edwards]], the BBC's lead presenter for major breaking news, from Monday to Thursday and [[Jane Hill]] on Friday<!-- Do not add weekend presenters, the branded News at Five only runs on weekdays -->. The show includes a detailed look at the news, as well as analysis with guests and sport and weather updates.\n\nUnlike most other BBC News Channel bulletins, the ''BBC News at Five'' is presented from Studio C, which is usually the main studio for BBC World News.\n\n==Weekends and Bank Holidays==\nDuring weekends and bank holidays, BBC News at Five resembles an unbranded BBC News channel bulletin, usually lasting for 30 minutes. As the main evening news on Saturday is normally at 17:30, when the main news isn't the back half hour is filled with a sports bulletin and ''The Film Review''.  It presented from the News Channel's main studio, studio E. \n\n== History ==\n\nThe programme started on 3 April 2006 as part of the BBC's relaunch of BBC News presenters, which saw the introduction of the new flagship programme to compete against [[Jeremy Thompson]]'s ''[[Live at Five (Sky News programme)|Live at Five]]'' programme on rival channel [[Sky News]], and to improve BBC News ratings for the hour.\n\nAs part of the 2008 revamp of the entire news output, the show moved studios within [[BBC Television Centre]] along with [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] and the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' bulletins. The show originally broadcast from Studio N8 but moved to Studio N6.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the programme moved to [[Broadcasting House]] along with BBC News and the BBC One bulletins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html |title=BBC News' television output moves to new studios at Broadcasting House |publisher=BBC |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref> On 4 November 2013, the ''BBC News at Five'' received new opening titles featuring the hour of broadcast.\n\n== Outside broadcasts ==\n\nAs well as presenting from the studio, the main presenters are called upon to present on location when major stories break. For example, [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] presented live from the BBC's Washington Studio for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 US Presidential Elections and has presented live from Basra from the withdrawal ceremony. [[George Alagiah]] presented from L'Aquila in April 2009 and Haiti in January 2010 when earthquakes struck the countries. During the 2015 Election campaign Edwards presented from across the UK, while [[Gavin Esler]] was based in Edinburgh and [[Clive Myrie]] served as the London presenter.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Presenters ==\n<!-- Do not add weekend presenters, the branded News at Five only runs on weekdays -->\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#9A0000\" align=\"center\"\n! <span style=\"color:white\">Years</span> !! <span style=\"color:white\">Presenter</span> !! <span style=\"color:white\">Current role</span> \n|-\n| 2006\u2013present || [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] || Main presenter (Monday\u2013Thursday)\n|-\n| 2013\u2013present ||[[Jane Hill]]|| Main presenter (Friday)\n|-\n| 2006\u2013present ||[[Ben Brown (journalist)|Ben Brown]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Regular relief presenter\n|-\n| 2010\u2013present || [[Clive Myrie]]\n|-\n| 2006\u2013present || [[Julian Worricker]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Occasional relief presenter\n|-\n| 2016\u2013present || [[Christian Fraser]]\n|- \n| 2017\u2013present || [[Reeta Chakrabarti]]\n|-\n| 2017-present || [[Shaun Ley]]\n|- \n| 2018-present || [[Carole Walker]]\n|-\n| 2018-present || [[Martine Croxall]]\n|-\n| 2018-present || Rebecca Jones\n|-\n|2019-present\n|[[Carrie Gracie]]\n|}\n\n=== Former presenters ===\nIf there is no position before the years of being a presenter, then this newsreader was either a relief presenter or occasional guest stand-in presenter.\n\n* [[Gavin Esler]] (Deputy presenter, 2006\u20132017)\n* [[Peter Sissons]] (2006\u20132009)\n* [[Emily Maitlis]] (2007\u20132016)\n* [[Louise Minchin]] (2007\u20132011)\n* [[Nicholas Owen (journalist)|Nicholas Owen]] (2008\u20132017)\n* [[Tim Willcox]] (2008\u20132015)\n* [[Joanna Gosling]] (2009\u20132010)\n* [[Jon Sopel]] (2009\u20132012)\n* [[Zeinab Badawi]] (2011)\n* [[Sophie Long]] (2011\u20132012)\n* Annita McVeigh (2013\u20132017)\n* [[Matthew Price]] (2015)\n* [[Maxine Mawhinney]] (2015\u20132016)\n* [[Simon McCoy]] (2015\u20132017)\n\n== Format ==\n\nGenerally the program follows a standard format as follows -\n\n* 17:00 \u2013 Headlines\n* 17:00\u201317:15 \u2013 Stories\n* 17:15 \u2013 Headlines\n* 17:15\u201317:25 \u2013 Interview, in-depth analysis\n* 17:25\u201317:30 \u2013 Weather\n* 17:30 \u2013 Headlines\n* 17:30\u201317:45 \u2013 Stories with sports round-up (except on Friday)\n* 17:45 \u2013 Headlines (except on Friday for a look ahead to [[Sportsday]])\n* 17:45\u201317:55 \u2013 Interview, in-depth analysis (except on Friday for [[The Film Review]])\n* 17:55\u201318:00 \u2013 Weather\n\nThe weather updates are generally presented from the screen away from the main desk.

[[Paul the Apostle]] did not live to form [[Christianity]] and followers of [[Jesus]] (called Yeshua ben Yosef) live as a sect of [[Messianic Judaism]] known as the Yeshuites. An offshoot from Yeshuites, led by a descendent of Jesus and his angel companions, had made its foothold in [[Gaul]] after a long period of exile and persecution. Their creed based on [[apotheosis]] of early founders predominates in the country now known as Terre d'Ange.\n\n==Companion material==\n[[File:Earth Begotten.jpg|upright|thumb|Cover of ''Earth Begotten'']]\n''Earth Begotten'' is a companion book to [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s ''Kushiel's Legacy'' [[fantasy]] series. It is essentially a prelude to the tales of Terre d'Ange and explores the mythology and origins of Blessed Elua and his seven angelic companions.<ref>[http://phoenixterranbooks.blogspot.com/2006/11/earth-begotten-journey-of-blessed-elua.html Experiments in Reading: Earth Begotten:The Journey of Blessed Elua]</ref> Whilst the story is very short, fewer than 1500 words, it builds on references to Elua and His Companions throughout the series and elaborates on Elua's conception and [[Ascension (mystical)|ascension]] to the \"true Terre d'Ange that lies beyond\".\n\n''Earth Begotten'' was published in April, 2003 by Havilah Press. A strictly limited run of 50 copies was produced to ensure that the bound version remained a [[Collectable|collector's item]].<ref>[http://www.jacquelinecarey.com/faq.htm Jacqueline Carey Official Author Site - FAQs]</ref> The book is printed in silver ink on black paper in [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur type]]. The pages were printed by hand using a Columbian hand press. The outer boards are veneered in wood that has been treated with silver pigment and lined with scarlet endpapers.<ref>[http://www.havilahpress.com/earth_begotten.html Havilah Press]</ref>\n\nThe full text is available on Jacqueline Carey's website.<ref>[https://www.jacquelinecarey.com/earth-begotten/ Earth Begotten]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe main setting of Kushiel's Legacy is the country of Terre d'Ange, the \"Land of the Angels\". D'Angelines, as the citizens are called, are descended from Blessed Elua and his band of [[fallen angel]]s. Elua was born when the blood of the crucified [[Jesus|Yeshua]] ben Yosef, the son of the One God, mixed with the tears of the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]] and then was quickened by Mother Earth. Scorned by his grandfather, the [[One God]], Elua wandered the Earth with eight companion angels. The eight were Naamah, Anael, Azza, Shemhazai, Camael, Cassiel, Eisheth, and Kushiel. After years of wandering, Elua and his companions settled in the land that would become Terre d'Ange. Elua espoused the precept \"Love as thou wilt\" and he and his companions inter-bred with the native populace, creating the D'Angeline people. Elua himself is a cross between [[Dionysus]] and a wandering fertility god associated with nature, love, and liberty.\n\nKushiel's Legacy is set about one thousand years after the time of Elua, and the D'Angeline people worship him and his eight companions as gods. They live by his precept, \"Love as thou wilt,\" and, since Naamah sold her body at times to support Elua during their wanderings, consider [[religious prostitution|prostitution]] to be a sacred service. This service is regulated by its own guild. Furthermore, to serve in the [[Court of Night-Blooming Flowers]], composed of several Houses, each with their own interpretation of Naamah's reasons for prostituting herself, is regarded as the highest pinnacle in Naamah's Service.\n\nTerre d'Ange is divided into seven provinces, each with a companion as its patron deity. Cassiel, who eschewed mortal love and never fully rejected the One God, is the only companion without a province. The [[Cassiline Brotherhood]], however, follows the ways and philosophy of Cassiel and have a prominent role in d'Angeline society. Naamah (patron Goddess of the Night Court) is the patron of [[Namarre]], Anael of [[L'Agnace]], Azza of [[Azzalle]], Shemhazai of [[Siovale]], Camael of [[Camlach]], Eisheth of [[Eisande]], and Kushiel of [[Kusheth]].\n\nThe royal House Courcel rules Terre D'Ange from the City of Elua in L'Agnace. At the beginning of the series relations are generally good with Terre d'Ange's neighboring countries of [[Places in Kushiel's Legacy|Aragonia]], [[Caerdicca Unitas]], and distant [[Places in Kushiel's Legacy|Khebbel-im-Akkad]]. [[Skaldia]], however, has long sought to conquer the D'Angelines. They also have good relations with [[Alba and Eire (Kushiel's Legacy)|Alba and Eire]] though scarce given the impact of the [[Master of the Straits]].\n\nThe heroine of the first three installments of the series is ''anguissette'' Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay, whose unique talents lead her to save her nation from several terrible fates. The second trilogy of the series follows [[Kushiel's Scion#Imriel de la Courcel|Imriel n\u00f3 Montr\u00e8ve de la Courcel]], Ph\u00e8dre's adopted son and Prince of Terre d'Ange in his quest to manhood. The third trilogy within the Kushiel Universe follows Moirin, a half-d'Angeline and half-[[Alba and Eire (Kushiel's Legacy)|Alban]] descendant of House Courcel, approximately 100 years after Kushiel's Legacy.\n\n==Major characters in ''Kushiel's Dart''==\n;Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay: the heroine of the first trilogy, an ''anguissette''.\n;Anafiel Delaunay: Ph\u00e8dre's mentor and foster father.\n;Alcuin n\u00f3 Delaunay: Ph\u00e8dre's foster brother.\n;Joscelin Verreuil: Ph\u00e8dre's [[Cassiline Brotherhood|Cassiline]] bodyguard.\n;Hyacinthe: a [[Tsingani|Tsingano]], Ph\u00e8dre's longtime friend.\n;Melisande Shahrizai: a D'Angeline noblewoman.\n;Ysandre de la Courcel: queen of [[Terre d'Ange]].\n;Drustan mab Necthana: Curach ruler of [[Alba and Eire (Kushiel's Legacy)|Alba]].\n;Waldemar Selig: leader of [[Skaldia]].\n\n*'''Calantia''' is one of the children with whom Ph\u00e8dre was reared; she went to foster at Orchis House.\n*'''Cecilie Laveau-Perrin''' is a former adept of the House.\n*'''Donatien''' is a boy whose marque was bought by Cereus House. Donatien was reared in Mandrake House and retains a great fear of the place and its adepts. He served at the Midwinter Masque with Ph\u00e8dre.\n*'''Ellyn''' is one of the children with whom Ph\u00e8dre was reared, noted for being tender-hearted. She served at the Midwinter Masque with Ph\u00e8dre.\n*'''Etienne''' is one of the children with whom Ph\u00e8dre was reared, half-brother to Ellyn. Etienne was too young to attend the Midwinter Masque the year Ph\u00e8dre and Ellyn served at it.\n*'''Jacanth''' is a boy whose marque was bought by Cereus House. He served at the Midwinter Masque with Ph\u00e8dre.\n*'''Jareth Moran''' is the Second to Dowayne Miriam Bouscerve when Ph\u00e8dre first arrives at the House, and becomes Dowayne upon her death.\n*'''Juliette''' is one of the children with whom Ph\u00e8dre was reared; her marque was bought by Dahlia House.\n*'''Miriam Bouscevre''' is the Dowayne of the House when Ph\u00e8dre first arrives: elderly, with white hair and grey eyes.\n*'''Suriah''' is an adept of the House who portrayed the Winter Queen at a Midwinter Masque in her youth, and became Second to Jareth Moran later in life.\n*'''Japheth n\u00f3 Eglantine-Vardennes''' is a former adept who has become a premier playwright; his play ''Passion of Naamah'' is chosen to be performed for King Ganelon.\n*'''Favrielle n\u00f3 Eglantine''' is an adept who had a fall just before her debut that left her scarred (some say this was not an accident).  She is a clothier, and she designs Phedre's costume for her re-introduction into the Service of Naamah.  Phedre ends up paying Favrielle's marque, so that she can set up as a clothier in her own right, instead of being forced to work off her marque in servitude to Eglantine House.\n*'''Raphael Murain n\u00f3 Gentian''' is the adept who aided Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay in understanding the meaning of her dreams, which understanding prompted Ph\u00e8dre to seek Melisande Shahrizai in [[La Serenissima]], in ''[[Kushiel's Chosen]]''.  Raphael later became a priest at the Great Temple of Naamah in the City of Elua, who gives [[Kushiel's Scion#Imriel de la Courcel|Imriel n\u00f3 Montreve de la Courcel]] Namaah's blessing in ''[[Kushiel's Justice]]''.\n*'''Liliane de Souverain''' was an adept of Jasmine House before wedding (without the blessing of her House) and giving birth to [[Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay]].  As Liliane had made her marque, she was free to do as she wished, but the child of an unsanctioned union was not treated as part of the House.\n*'''Miriette n\u00f3 Orchis''' is an adept who, after making her marque, sets up her own salon. When Ph\u00e8dre and Alcuin serve Anafiel Delaunay in Naamah's honor, Mierette lies with Alcuin and soothes some of his strain about being dedicated to Naamah only for the love of his master, Anafiel Delaunay.\n*'''Didier Vascon''' is the Second of Valerian House during ''[[Kushiel's Dart]]''; by the events of ''[[Kushiel's Scion]]'', he has become Dowayne.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.jacquelinecarey.com/|Author's official website}}\n* [http://www.kushielverse.com/ Kushielverse.com]: \"The World of Terre d'Ange and Beyond\"\n* {{isfdb series|id=23657}}\n* {{isfdb title|id=1228793|title=Earth Begotten}}\n\n{{Kushiel's Legacy}}\n{{Jacqueline Carey}}\n\n[[Category:Kushiel's Legacy| ]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novel series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{In-universe|date=April 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2011}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox book series\n| name             = Kushiel's Legacy\n| books            = {{Unbulleted list|[[Kushiel's Dart]]|[[Kushiel's Chosen]]|[[Kushiel's Avatar]]|[[Kushiel's Scion]]|[[Kushiel's Justice]]|[[Kushiel's Mercy]]}}\n| author           = [[Jacqueline Carey]]\n| image            = \n| image_caption    = \n| title_orig       = \n| translator       = \n| illustrator      = \n| cover_artist     = \n| country          = United States of America\n| language         = English\n| genre            = \n| publisher        = \n| pub_date         = \n| english_pub_date = \n| media_type       = \n| preceded_by      = \n| followed_by      = Moirin Trilogy\n}}\n'''Kushiel's Legacy''' is a series of [[fantasy]] novels by [[Jacqueline Carey]], comprising the Ph\u00e8dre Trilogy and the Imriel Trilogy (called the \"Treason's Heir\" trilogy in the United Kingdom).

[[Paul the Apostle]] did not live to form [[Christianity]] and followers of [[Jesus]] (called Yeshua ben Yosef) live as a sect of [[Messianic Judaism]] known as the Yeshuites. An offshoot from Yeshuites, led by a descendent of Jesus and his angel companions, had made its foothold in [[Gaul]] after a long period of exile and persecution. Their creed based on [[apotheosis]] of early founders predominates in the country now known as Terre d'Ange.\n\n==Companion material==\n[[File:Earth Begotten.jpg|upright|thumb|Cover of ''Earth Begotten'']]\n''Earth Begotten'' is a companion book to [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s ''Kushiel's Legacy'' [[fantasy]] series. It is essentially a prelude to the tales of Terre d'Ange and explores the mythology and origins of Blessed Elua and his seven angelic companions.<ref>[http://phoenixterranbooks.blogspot.com/2006/11/earth-begotten-journey-of-blessed-elua.html Experiments in Reading: Earth Begotten:The Journey of Blessed Elua]</ref> Whilst the story is very short, fewer than 1500 words, it builds on references to Elua and His Companions throughout the series and elaborates on Elua's conception and [[Ascension (mystical)|ascension]] to the \"true Terre d'Ange that lies beyond\".\n\n''Earth Begotten'' was published in April, 2003 by Havilah Press. A strictly limited run of 50 copies was produced to ensure that the bound version remained a [[Collectable|collector's item]].<ref>[http://www.jacquelinecarey.com/faq.htm Jacqueline Carey Official Author Site - FAQs]</ref> The book is printed in silver ink on black paper in [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur type]]. The pages were printed by hand using a Columbian hand press. The outer boards are veneered in wood that has been treated with silver pigment and lined with scarlet endpapers.<ref>[http://www.havilahpress.com/earth_begotten.html Havilah Press]</ref>\n\nThe full text is available on Jacqueline Carey's website.<ref>[https://www.jacquelinecarey.com/earth-begotten/ Earth Begotten]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe main setting of Kushiel's Legacy is the country of Terre d'Ange, the \"Land of the Angels\". D'Angelines, as the citizens are called, are descended from Blessed Elua and his band of [[fallen angel]]s. Elua was born when the blood of the crucified [[Jesus|Yeshua]] ben Yosef, the son of the One God, mixed with the tears of the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]] and then was quickened by Mother Earth. Scorned by his grandfather, the [[One God]], Elua wandered the Earth with eight companion angels. The eight were Naamah, Anael, Azza, Shemhazai, Camael, Cassiel, Eisheth, and Kushiel. After years of wandering, Elua and his companions settled in the land that would become Terre d'Ange. Elua espoused the precept \"Love as thou wilt\" and he and his companions inter-bred with the native populace, creating the D'Angeline people. [[Elua]] himself is a cross between [[Dionysus]] and a wandering fertility god associated with nature, love, and liberty.\n\nKushiel's Legacy is set about one thousand years after the time of Elua, and the D'Angeline people worship him and his eight companions as gods. They live by his precept, \"Love as thou wilt,\" and, since Naamah sold her body at times to support Elua during their wanderings, consider [[religious prostitution|prostitution]] to be a sacred service. This service is regulated by its own guild. Furthermore, to serve in the [[Court of Night-Blooming Flowers]], composed of several Houses, each with their own interpretation of Naamah's reasons for prostituting herself, is regarded as the highest pinnacle in Naamah's Service.\n\nTerre d'Ange is divided into seven provinces, each with a companion as its patron deity. Cassiel, who eschewed mortal love and never fully rejected the One God, is the only companion without a province. The [[Cassiline Brotherhood]], however, follows the ways and philosophy of Cassiel and have a prominent role in d'Angeline society. Naamah (patron Goddess of the Night Court) is the patron of [[Namarre]], Anael of [[L'Agnace]], Azza of [[Azzalle]], Shemhazai of [[Siovale]], Camael of [[Camlach]], Eisheth of [[Eisande]], and Kushiel of [[Kusheth]].\n\nThe royal [[House Courcel]] rules Terre D'Ange from the City of Elua in L'Agnace. At the beginning of the series relations are generally good with Terre d'Ange's neighboring countries of [[Places in Kushiel's Legacy|Aragonia]], [[Caerdicca Unitas]], and distant [[Places in Kushiel's Legacy|Khebbel-im-Akkad]]. [[Skaldia]], however, has long sought to conquer the D'Angelines. They also have good relations with [[Alba and Eire (Kushiel's Legacy)|Alba and Eire]] though scarce given the impact of the [[Master of the Straits]].\n\nThe heroine of the first three installments of the series is ''anguissette'' Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay, whose unique talents lead her to save her nation from several terrible fates. The second trilogy of the series follows [[Kushiel's Scion#Imriel de la Courcel|Imriel n\u00f3 Montr\u00e8ve de la Courcel]], Ph\u00e8dre's adopted son and Prince of Terre d'Ange in his quest to manhood. The third trilogy within the Kushiel Universe follows Moirin, a half-d'Angeline and half-[[Alba and Eire (Kushiel's Legacy)|Alban]] descendant of [[House Courcel]], approximately 100 years after Kushiel's Legacy.\n\n==Major characters in ''Kushiel's Dart''==\n;Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay:the heroine of the first trilogy, an ''anguissette''.\n;Anafiel Delaunay:Ph\u00e8dre's mentor and foster father.\n;Alcuin n\u00f3 Delaunay:Ph\u00e8dre's foster brother.\n;Joscelin Verreuil:Ph\u00e8dre's [[Cassiline Brotherhood|Cassiline]] bodyguard.\n;Hyacinthe:a [[Tsingani|Tsingano]], Ph\u00e8dre's longtime friend.\n;Melisande Shahrizai:a D'Angeline noblewoman.\n;[[House Courcel|Ysandre de la Courcel]]:queen of [[Terre d'Ange]].\n;Drustan mab Necthana: Curach ruler of [[Alba and Eire (Kushiel's Legacy)|Alba]].\n;Waldemar Selig:leader of [[Skaldia]].\n\n*'''Calantia''' is one of the children with whom Ph\u00e8dre was reared; she went to foster at [[Orchis House]].\n*'''Cecilie Laveau-Perrin''' is a former adept of the House.\n*'''Donatien''' is a boy whose marque was bought by Cereus House.

She is a clothier, and she designs Phedre's costume for her re-introduction into the Service of Naamah.  Phedre ends up paying Favrielle's marque, so that she can set up as a clothier in her own right, instead of being forced to work off her marque in servitude to Eglantine House.\n*'''Raphael Murain n\u00f3 Gentian''' is the adept who aided [[Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay]] in understanding the meaning of her dreams, which understanding prompted Ph\u00e8dre to seek [[Melisande Shahrizai]] in [[La Serenissima]], in ''[[Kushiel's Chosen]]''.

He married his first wife, Judith Atherton Malkiel, in 1954; they had one son, Jonathan. After Judith Malkiel's death in 1987, Burton Malkiel married his second wife, Nancy Weiss, in 1988.

He has no memory of who he is or how he got there. He gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader, and Newt, the second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing simple but effective rules. The elevator box surfaces from under the ground once every week supplying new food, tools, medicine, and sometimes weapons. Every month a new boy with no memory of anything but his first name finds himself in that elevator box. The Glade is surrounded by a square of 4&nbsp;mile-high walls made of concrete. These walls have openings in them, which slide shut like doors every night. Outside the walls is the Maze, a labyrinth of high concrete walls covered in ivy that changes every day. The Maze houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. Grievers are described as amorphous monsters of metal and flesh. The Gladers are trying to stay alive as well as \"solve\" the Maze by appointing 'runners' to run through it as fast as they can while tracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape.\n\nOne day after Thomas' arrival, a girl named Teresa is delivered through the elevator into the Glade with a note saying \"She's the last one. Ever.\" It implies that there will be no more children sent into the Glade. The girl subsequently lapses into a long \ncoma. When Thomas comes to visit her, he recognizes her, but cannot remember her name until he hears her voice telepathically in his mind telling him her name. Teresa wakes up and tells Thomas that they knew each other before they were sent into the Glade, and reveals that they could communicate telepathically.\n\nMinho, the keeper of the runners, and Alby go into the Maze to see what they think is their first dead Griever. Alby is stung by the creature and, while Minho is trying to help him out of the Maze, Thomas runs in to help. All three are then stranded in the Maze overnight. Minho, believing Alby is dead without the Serum, tells Thomas to leave him and just run, looking for shelter so the Grievers don't find them. Thomas, unable to leave Alby to die, uses the vines on the walls to pull him up and out of the view of the Grievers, then attracts their attention and evades them. Minho sees Thomas's evasion tactic and uses it to send the four Grievers chasing them over the Cliff. Thomas, Alby, and Minho are the first people in the Glade to survive a night in the maze. After getting back to The Glade the next morning, Newt calls a Gathering of The Keepers to discuss what to do with Thomas. Some of the Keepers vote to relieve him of punishment while others (especially Gally) vote to lock him up in the Slammer (the jail block) as a punishment. Minho, however, nominates Thomas to replace him as the Keeper of The Runners. Gally decides to kick Minho off The Council, causing Minho to attack him. Thomas is locked up in jail and the next day he starts his training with Minho. \n\nAfter their miraculous return, Teresa's arrival triggers a series of changes to life in the Glade: people start acting strangely, the sun disappears, the weekly deliveries of supplies stop coming, and the doors of the Maze stay open at night, which allows the Grievers to enter the Glade and hunt the children. \n\nThomas proposes that the walls of the Maze are not random, but that their movements are actually a code, leading to the discovery that the Maze is spelling out words. Thomas also discovers that what they previously thought was the Cliff is actually where the Grievers leave the Maze (\"The Griever Hole\"). This drives Thomas to think they need memories to get out, so he intentionally gets stung by a Griever so he can receive the antidote (\"Grief Serum\") and thereby go through ''the Changing''. It is known that the Changing can trigger memories and sometimes violence.\n\nThomas and the Gladers find out what the pattern is. The Gladers to decide to make a run for the exit, knowing that taking on the Grievers is a suicide mission, but deciding that nothing is worse than their current fate. They succeed, only to find out that they were test subjects in an experiment conducted by an organization called ''World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department'' (WICKED). The teenagers escape to a laboratory but encounter Gally, who had not escaped with them. Acting under mind control, he moves to throw a knife at Thomas, but a young Glader, Chuck, jumps to save him.\n\nAfter briefly mourning the death of Chuck, all 20 Gladers are rescued. They are brought to a safe haven and told about catastrophic [[solar flare]]s that caused an apocalyptic event, followed by a virus called ''the Flare'' that killed millions. The rescuers reveal that orphaned children are being tested to find a cure for the virus.\n\n;Epilogue\nThe epilogue is [[Omniscient narrator|written in the voice of]] Chancellor Ava Paige\u2014a feature of all the novels in the trilogy. She reveals that the group who rescued the Gladers may just be another variable in the experiment and that the Gladers weren't the only group being evaluated.\n\n==Characters==\n; '''Thomas''': The [[protagonist]]. Thomas is the last boy, but not the last person to enter the Glade. The only thing he remembered when he came into the glade was his name. Chuck described him as about 16 years old, of average height, and brown-haired. He was called \"Greenie\", a nickname given to new arrivals. He becomes a Runner with Minho after being the first person to spend a whole night in the Maze and saves Alby when he is about to die. He has a telepathic connection with Teresa and was able to talk to her while she was in a coma.\n; '''Teresa''': One of the main protagonists. The first girl and last person to enter the Glade. When she entered the Glade she was in a [[coma]] and Newt thought she was dead. She also calls Thomas \"Tom\". She has a telepathic connection with Thomas. She is also known to help Thomas out of the maze and fight the Grievers in the Griever Hole. She is thin, has black hair and blue eyes, and relatively pale skin.\n; '''Alby''': The eldest and the leader of the Gladers. He is described as 'The dark-skinned boy with short-cropped hair, his face clean-shaven'. He tries to keep order within the group by having all the boys follow the rules they've set down to survive. He has a very close relationship with Newt, his second-in-command. He was in the group of 30 people who first arrived in the Glade. Alby commits suicide by walking into a group of Grievers, thinking that it was better that he die there than outside the Maze.\n; '''Newt''': One of the main protagonists and is good friends with Thomas and Minho. He used to be a Runner but is no longer able-footed. He is very kind, friendly, and welcoming to Thomas. He is Alby's closest friend and second-in-command and takes over as leader when Alby no longer feels capable.\n;'''Minho''': One of the main protagonists and is the Keeper of the Runners. He is in charge of navigating and mapping out the Maze. As a Runner, he's in very good shape and is described as \"an Asian kid with strong, heavily-muscled arms and short black hair.\" He is sarcastic and a jokester. He tends to react without thinking, which leads himself into trouble. He and Thomas quickly become good friends. \n; '''Chuck''': A young and chubby boy with curly hair who was the newest Glader until Thomas arrived. He immediately becomes friends with Thomas and acts like a little brother towards him. Chuck was a \"Slopper\". He is around 12 or 13&nbsp; years old. He is killed by Gally after a knife is thrown at him while he is saving Thomas (shot in the movie).\n; '''Gally''': The main antagonist. A Glader who lives by the rules Alby put in place. He does not trust Thomas and shows an immense dislike for him. He is also the Keeper of the Builders. He runs away from the Glade in a fit of rage after exclaiming that he thought \"Thomas was not to be trusted\" in the Gathering. At the end of the book, he kills Chuck by throwing a knife into his chest. (shot with a gun in the movie)\n; '''Ben''': A Runner. After undergoing the Changing and attempting to kill Thomas. Ben is banished to the Maze while still induced with the serum and still psycho and dies overnight.\n; '''Ava Paige''': The Chancellor of WICKED and the person responsible for sending teenagers into the Maze. She appears in the Epilogue as an e-mail.\n; '''Grievers''': Mechanical creatures that haunt and kill the Gladers in the maze. In \"The Ending\" they are let free onto the Glade to kill one person every day.\n\n==Development==\nIn late 2005, Dashner had published four books to complete ''The Jimmy Fincher Saga'', which had been with a small regional publisher. His publisher wanted him to write another book, but he decided he would try for a national book market instead. In November of that year he had an idea when going to be \"about a bunch of teenagers living inside an unsolvable Maze full of hideous creatures, in the future, in a dark, dystopian world. It would be an experiment, to study their minds. Terrible things would be done to them &ndash; awful things; completely hopeless &ndash; until the victims turn everything on its head.\" The book was later published in 2009.<ref name=\"tale\">{{cite web |first=James |last=Dashner |url=http://jamesdashner.blogspot.com/2008/07/tale-of-maze-runner.html |title=The Tale of The Maze Runner |publisher=The Dashner Dude |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Dashner wrote the book from December 2005 to March&nbsp;2006.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote: \"Hard to put down, this is clearly just a first installment, and it will leave readers dying to find out what comes next.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-dashner/the-maze-runner/ |title=The Maze Runner |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nJessica Harrison of the ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' labelled ''The Maze Runner'' as \"a thrilling adventurous book for kids ages&nbsp;13+ that will get readers' hearts pumping and leave them asking for more.\" She noted that it \"starts out a bit slow\" but as it matched Thomas's confusion and picked up pace as he became more accustomed, she wrote that \"it's almost as if Dashner is easing the reader into what becomes a fast-paced, nonstop action.\" However, she thought the \"only drawback\" was the \"fictionalized slang\", saying, \"While it feels realistic and fits with his characters, it gets old pretty fast.

He is in charge of navigating and mapping out the Maze. As a Runner, he's in very good shape and is described as \"an Asian kid with strong, heavily-muscled arms and short black hair.\" He is sarcastic and a jokester. He tends to react without thinking, which leads himself into trouble. He and Thomas quickly become good friends. \n; '''Chuck''': A young and chubby boy with curly hair who was the newest Glader until Thomas arrived. He immediately becomes friends with Thomas and acts like a little brother towards him. Chuck was a \"Slopper\". He is around 12 or 13&nbsp; years old. He is killed by Gally after a knife is thrown at him while he is saving Thomas (shot in the movie).\n; '''Gally''': The main antagonist. A Glader who lives by the rules Alby put in place. He does not trust Thomas and shows an immense dislike for him. He is also the Keeper of the Builders. He runs away from the Glade in a fit of rage after exclaiming that he thought \"Thomas was not to be trusted\" in the Gathering. At the end of the book, he kills Chuck by throwing a knife into his chest. (shot with a gun in the movie)\n; '''Ben''': A Runner. After undergoing the Changing and attempting to kill Thomas. Ben is banished to the Maze while still induced with the serum and still psycho and dies overnight.\n; '''Ava Paige''': The Chancellor of WICKED and the person responsible for sending teenagers into the Maze. She appears in the Epilogue as an e-mail.\n; '''Grievers''': Mechanical creatures that haunt and kill the Gladers in the maze. In \"The Ending\" they are let free onto the Glade to kill one person every day.\n\n==Development==\nIn late 2005, Dashner had published four books to complete ''The Jimmy Fincher Saga'', which had been with a small regional publisher. His publisher wanted him to write another book, but he decided he would try for a national book market instead. In November of that year he had an idea when going to be \"about a bunch of teenagers living inside an unsolvable Maze full of hideous creatures, in the future, in a dark, dystopian world. It would be an experiment, to study their minds. Terrible things would be done to them &ndash; awful things; completely hopeless &ndash; until the victims turn everything on its head.\" The book was later published in 2009.<ref name=\"tale\">{{cite web |first=James |last=Dashner |url=http://jamesdashner.blogspot.com/2008/07/tale-of-maze-runner.html |title=The Tale of The Maze Runner |publisher=The Dashner Dude |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Dashner wrote the book from December 2005 to March&nbsp;2006.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote: \"Hard to put down, this is clearly just a first installment, and it will leave readers dying to find out what comes next.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-dashner/the-maze-runner/ |title=The Maze Runner |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nJessica Harrison of the ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' labelled ''The Maze Runner'' as \"a thrilling adventurous book for kids ages&nbsp;13+ that will get readers' hearts pumping and leave them asking for more.\" She noted that it \"starts out a bit slow\" but as it matched Thomas's confusion and picked up pace as he became more accustomed, she wrote that \"it's almost as if Dashner is easing the reader into what becomes a fast-paced, nonstop action.\" However, she thought the \"only drawback\" was the \"fictionalized slang\", saying, \"While it feels realistic and fits with his characters, it gets old pretty fast.

The harbour is generally shallow and due to the tidal harmonics in the [[English Channel]] has a double high water on each tide. On the north side of the harbour, east of the Avon are Priory Marsh, and to the east of this Stanpit Marsh, a [[Local Nature Reserve]]. To the west side of the harbour are [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick Fields]], the southern flank of the harbour being bounded by [[Hengistbury Head]], a prominent coastal headland.\nThe harbour flows into the Christchurch Bay and the English Channel through a narrow channel known locally as The Run which rests between [[Mudeford Quay]] and [[Mudeford Spit]]. Shallow-draught boats can enter from this channel and cruise up stream for {{convert|2|mi|0}} choosing either the Avon or the Stour, the Stour leading up as far as [[Iford, Dorset|Iford Bridge]] passing Christchurch Quay and [[Tuckton]].\n\nChristchurch Harbour [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) is a {{convert|352|ha|adj=on}} site designated both for its biological and geological interest. It comprises the estuary of the Stour and Avon and the Hengistbury Head peninsula. The varied habitats include saltmarsh, wet meadows, grassland, heath, sand dune, woodland and scrub. The site is of great ornithological interest.<ref name =citation>{{cite web|url= https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteDetail.aspx?SiteCode=S1002678&SiteName=christchurch&countyCode=&responsiblePerson=|title=Christchurch Harbour citation|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=  3 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=map>{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=sssiIndex&query=HYPERLINK%3D%271002678%27 |title=Map of Christchurch Harbour|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=   3 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[harbour]] was formed around 7000 years ago when the sea level rose at the end of the last [[Ice Age]]. Previously the area which was many miles from the open sea was inhabited by [[Stone Age]] hunters.

It is likely that slaves were also exported through the harbour. The boats used at this time were shallow draft, oak-planked with square leather sails for propulsion. It would have been a twelve-hour passage across the channel to [[Cherbourg]] and without any modern compasses or much weather forecasting. Despite this there was considerable two way trade with both British and Foreign Ports, it then declined as a result of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion of France in 56 BCE.<ref>[http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=389369 Dorset for you Christchurch Harbour]</ref> The remains of a Roman ship were discovered in the harbour in 1910.<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story, p31 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> Trade continued until the Roman Invasion of Britain in AD43.

Traffic used the river from 1684 to 1720 with a break whilst repairs were made from 1695 to 1700. The route was finally abandoned in 1730.<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story,p64 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> In 1695 [[Lord Clarendon]] made a new entrance in [[Mudeford]] Sandbank using the iron stone from Hengistbury to form a training bank, these rocks now called Clarendon Rocks are still in existence, but the new entrance silted up and the channel returned to its original course. During this period and up until the middle of the 19th century, [[smuggling]] was rife in the Harbour (see the [[Battle of Mudeford]]).\n\nThere were numerous Harbour Improvement schemes proposed in the next three centuries, particularly the Railway and Docks Scheme of 1885. This would have seen major dredging of the harbour, training banks within the harbour and a railway terminus on the south side.<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story,p66 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> In 1965 there were a plans to construct a marina at Wick Hams.<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story,p74 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> This and the other schemes were never proceeded with. In the 1930s there were three \"tea boats\" providing refreshments to holidaymakers and at least another five [[houseboats]] in the harbour these were all abandoned and then wrecked during [[World War II]].<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story,p51 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> The River was dredged in 1937 and again in the 1950s using a Suction [[Dredger]], in the late 1980s [[Wessex Water]] carried out substantial dredging in the River Stour from Iford bridge as far as Christchurch Quay, this was part of a Flood Alleviation Plan.<ref name=\"christchurchsailingclub.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.christchurchsailingclub.co.uk/?page_id=57 |title=Christchurch Harbour |publisher=Christchurchsailingclub.co.uk |date= |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> The channel has been marked since at least 1884 first by Christchurch Sailing Club and since 1963 by the Harbour Improvements Association now renamed Christchurch Harbour Association.<ref name=\"christchurchsailingclub.co.uk\" /> Since 1963 the [[Mudeford Lifeboat Station|Mudeford inshore lifeboat]] has been stationed on the quay at Mudeford.\n\n==Geology==\nThe Harbour is made up of Sandy Gravels, Sands, Muddy Sands, and towards the margins Silty Muds.<ref name=\"scopac.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scopac.org.uk/scopac_sedimentdb/chrst/chrst.htm |title=Christchurch Bay |publisher=Scopac.org.uk |date= |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>\nHigh and low [[Salt marsh]] both exist within the harbour, the latter colonised by [[Puccinellia]] and other grasses. [[Spartina anglica]] does not exist in significant volume, with no sign that it was previously extensive. The sedimentation of the Harbour has not therefore been substantially affected in the way most other south coast estuaries have by the spread and die back of this species.<ref name=\"scopac.org.uk\" /> Any loss of the salt marsh appears to have been offset by the re-colonization of abandoned artificial salt pans. Extensive [[Phragmites]] reed beds occupy tidal creek margins and areas of higher marsh, where they front wet grazing meadows. The inflow and outflow of sediment in the Harbour is positive,. Grimbury Marsh, is substantially composed of dredged spoil material. In total the estuarine system is a sediment sink.<ref name=\"scopac.org.uk\" />\n\n==Royalty Fishery==\nThe earliest reference to the Royal Fishery at Christchurch dates back to 939AD<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\">http://www.sembcorpbw.co.uk/fishing-and-moorings/moorings.aspx</ref> and there was a valuable fishery in medieval times when the fishery was the property of the Lord of the Manor. The Royalty Fishery Title was conferred by Royal Grant during [[Queen Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reign and was renewed by [[Elizabeth I]]. It had come into the possession of the crown by reason of treason.<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" /> The Queen sold the rights back to Lord Huntington and it was sold on to the Lord of the Manor of Christchurch in 1791. The fishery was then sold to a Mr Thyrwit Walker in 1865, and it was purchased by West Hampshire Water Company in 1929. The Crown had retained the title and fishing rights to the bottom third presumably as an anti-smuggling measure.<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" /> Today the fishery is claimed to be best [[Sea trout]] fishing in England,<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" /> with some [[Salmon]] as well as [[Mullet (fish)|Mullet]] and [[European seabass|Bass]]. Also [[Coarse fish]], [[Common roach|Roach]], [[Leuciscus|Dace]], [[Carp]] and [[Pike (fish)|Pike]], the harbour and rivers have now been made a sport fishery where all species are returned to ensure the long term sustainability of the fishery.<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" />\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe harbour is home to a great variety of wildlife. Over 320 bird species have been recorded by Christchurch Harbour Ornithological Group.<ref>[http://www.chog.org.uk/Pages/Harbour%20Year%20List.htm Harbour List<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The harbour and marshes are an important staging point for migratory birds. There is also an abundance of insect life, and many rare plant species. Stanpit and the other marshes are used for grazing horses and cattle. Both [[Otter]]s and [[Seal (mammal)|Seals]] have been seen in the Harbour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.littleowl.org.uk/dog/articles/sightings.html |title=Dorset Otter Group |publisher=Littleowl.org.uk |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310222114/http://www.littleowl.org.uk/dog/articles/sightings.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Leisure==\nThe harbour is home to three Sailing Clubs, Highcliffe Sailing Club situated on Mudeford Quay, Mudeford Sailing Club on the North Shore and Christchurch Sailing Club adjacent to Place Mill on Christchurch Quay. Christchurch Rowing Club is situated on the Quomps above Christchurch Quay. Hengistbury Head Activities Centre is situated on the South Shore of the Harbour. There are more than 1,400 small boat moorings in the harbour and rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/pdf/m/j/Draft_Christchurch_and_Waterways_Management_Plan.pdf |title=Christchurch Harbour & Waterways management plan final draft|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> [[Sailing]], [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[canoeing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[kite surfing]] are all practised in the harbour.

There is also a ferry at [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]].\n\n==Around the harbour==\nTo describe the various features of the harbour, it is convenient to divide the harbour, and list the features from inland (west) to outlet (east end). [[Tuckton|Tuckton Bridge]] over the River Stour, although inland from the harbour, is a convenient starting point. This is also the boundary between [[Bournemouth]] and Christchurch.\n\n===North side===\nFrom [[Tuckton|Tuckton Bridge]] along the River Stour there are river front properties up to the Captains Club hotel which is located on the west end of a quay and open space known locally as ''The Quomps'' this is overlooked by [[Christchurch Priory]] at the eastern end. The River Avon joins the Stour alongside the Priory. Across the Avon are ''Priory'' and ''Grimbury Marsh'' then the larger ''Stanpit Marsh (see below)'', ''Blackberry point'' which is an island at High Water is to the east of the marsh. Further east are the residential areas of [[Stanpit]] and [[Mudeford]]. At the eastern end of the harbour is Mudeford Quay, and the harbour entrance which is a relatively narrow channel, named ''The Run'',<ref>University of Southampton geological survey</ref> the coast eastward and open to the sea leads to [[Highcliffe]], the next coastal village.\n\n===South side===\nFrom [[Tuckton|Tuckton Bridge]], the two main sections of the harbour shore are [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]] and [[Hengistbury Head]], which are in [[Southbourne, Dorset|Southbourne]] a suburb of Bournemouth. The harbour proper begins around ''Wick Fields'', a reed marsh and part of the area of importance for nature conservation. The [[Hengistbury Head]] Activities Centre is situated on the shore just before ''Barn Bight''. [[Hengistbury Head]] on the south shore was threatened during the nineteenth century by the mining of ironstone ''doggers'' which dramatically increased erosion. The silt washed into that part of the harbour threatened the ecology and to prevent this, the ''Quarry Pool'' was created on the headland by building a dam in 1976. ''Holloway's Dock'' cuts into the land before the shore reaches [[Mudeford]] Sandbank which juts northwards towards ''The Run''. The sandbank is the home to many [[Beach hut]]s, a cafe and the terminus for the Hengistbury Head [[Land train|Land Train]].\n\n==Stanpit Marsh==\n{{Main|Stanpit Marsh}}\nAlong part of the south west side of the [[Stanpit]] road is Stanpit Marsh. It was formed as the result of action and deposition of material from the rivers [[River Stour, Dorset|Stour]] and [[River Avon (Hampshire)|Avon]] as they meet with the salt water within Christchurch Harbour. Together with Grimbury Marsh, it forms one of the largest areas of salt marsh in the county.<ref name=\"Chaffey 49\">{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Chaffey |titlelink1=|others= |title=The Dorset Landscape, Its Scenery and Geology|year=2004|publisher=Dorset Books|location=Halsgrove House, Tiverton.|language= |isbn=1-871164-43-5|page=49 |pages= |at=}}</ref> It is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)]] and an important nature reserve of about {{convert|65|ha}}, combining both freshwater and saltwater habitats.<ref>Dorset for You web page on [http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/hengist.htm Stanpit Marsh]</ref> It is an important staging point for migratory birds.

The harbour is generally shallow and due to the tidal harmonics in the [[English Channel]] has a double high water on each tide. On the north side of the harbour, east of the Avon are Priory Marsh, and to the east of this Stanpit Marsh, a [[Local Nature Reserve]]. To the west side of the harbour are [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick Fields]], the southern flank of the harbour being bounded by [[Hengistbury Head]], a prominent coastal headland.\nThe harbour flows into the Christchurch Bay and the English Channel through a narrow channel known locally as The Run which rests between [[Mudeford Quay]] and [[Mudeford Spit]]. Shallow-draught boats can enter from this channel and cruise up stream for {{convert|2|mi|0}} choosing either the Avon or the Stour, the Stour leading up as far as [[Iford, Dorset|Iford Bridge]] passing Christchurch Quay and [[Tuckton]].\n\nChristchurch Harbour [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) is a {{convert|352|ha|adj=on}} site designated both for its biological and geological interest.

It is likely that slaves were also exported through the harbour. The boats used at this time were shallow draft, oak-planked with square leather sails for propulsion. It would have been a twelve-hour passage across the channel to [[Cherbourg]] and without any modern compasses or much weather forecasting. Despite this there was considerable two way trade with both British and Foreign Ports, it then declined as a result of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion of France in 56 BCE.<ref>[http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=389369 Dorset for you Christchurch Harbour]</ref> The remains of a Roman ship were discovered in the harbour in 1910.<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story, p31 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> Trade continued until the Roman Invasion of Britain in AD43.

Traffic used the river from 1684 to 1720 with a break whilst repairs were made from 1695 to 1700. The route was finally abandoned in 1730.<ref>Hengistbury Head-The Whole Story,p64 WA Hoodless, {{ISBN|1-873535-60-0}}</ref> In 1695 [[Lord Clarendon]] made a new entrance in [[Mudeford]] Sandbank using the iron stone from Hengistbury to form a training bank, these rocks now called Clarendon Rocks are still in existence, but the new entrance silted up and the channel returned to its original course. During this period and up until the middle of the 19th century, [[smuggling]] was rife in the Harbour (see the [[Battle of Mudeford]]).\n\nThere were numerous Harbour Improvement schemes proposed in the next three centuries, particularly the Railway and Docks Scheme of 1885.

[[Spartina anglica]] does not exist in significant volume, with no sign that it was previously extensive. The sedimentation of the Harbour has not therefore been substantially affected in the way most other south coast estuaries have by the spread and die back of this species.<ref name=\"scopac.org.uk\" /> Any loss of the salt marsh appears to have been offset by the re-colonization of abandoned artificial salt pans. Extensive [[Phragmites]] reed beds occupy tidal creek margins and areas of higher marsh, where they front wet grazing meadows. The inflow and outflow of sediment in the Harbour is positive,. Grimbury Marsh, is substantially composed of dredged spoil material. In total the estuarine system is a sediment sink.<ref name=\"scopac.org.uk\" />\n\n==Royalty Fishery==\nThe earliest reference to the Royal Fishery at Christchurch dates back to 939AD<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\">http://www.sembcorpbw.co.uk/fishing-and-moorings/moorings.aspx</ref> and there was a valuable fishery in medieval times when the fishery was the property of the Lord of the Manor. The Royalty Fishery Title was conferred by Royal Grant during [[Queen Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reign and was renewed by [[Elizabeth I]]. It had come into the possession of the crown by reason of treason.<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" /> The Queen sold the rights back to Lord Huntington and it was sold on to the Lord of the Manor of Christchurch in 1791. The fishery was then sold to a Mr Thyrwit Walker in 1865, and it was purchased by West Hampshire Water Company in 1929. The Crown had retained the title and fishing rights to the bottom third presumably as an anti-smuggling measure.<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" /> Today the fishery is claimed to be best [[Sea trout]] fishing in England,<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" /> with some [[Salmon]] as well as [[Mullet (fish)|Mullet]] and [[European seabass|Bass]]. Also [[Coarse fish]], [[Common roach|Roach]], [[Leuciscus|Dace]], [[Carp]] and [[Pike (fish)|Pike]], the harbour and rivers have now been made a sport fishery where all species are returned to ensure the long term sustainability of the fishery.<ref name=\"bwhwater.co.uk\" />\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe harbour is home to a great variety of wildlife. Over 320 bird species have been recorded by Christchurch Harbour Ornithological Group.<ref>[http://www.chog.org.uk/Pages/Harbour%20Year%20List.htm Harbour List<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The harbour and marshes are an important staging point for migratory birds. There is also an abundance of insect life, and many rare plant species. Stanpit and the other marshes are used for grazing horses and cattle. Both [[Otter]]s and [[Seal (mammal)|Seals]] have been seen in the Harbour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.littleowl.org.uk/dog/articles/sightings.html |title=Dorset Otter Group |publisher=Littleowl.org.uk |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310222114/http://www.littleowl.org.uk/dog/articles/sightings.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Leisure==\nThe harbour is home to three Sailing Clubs, Highcliffe Sailing Club situated on Mudeford Quay, Mudeford Sailing Club on the North Shore and Christchurch Sailing Club adjacent to Place Mill on Christchurch Quay. Chistchurch Rowing Club is situated on the Quomps above Christchurch Quay. Hengistbury Head Activities Centre is situated on the South Shore of the Harbour.

There is also a ferry at [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]].\n\n==Around the harbour==\nTo describe the various features of the harbour, it is convenient to divide the harbour, and list the features from inland (west) to outlet (east end). [[Tuckton|Tuckton Bridge]] over the River Stour, although inland from the harbour, is a convenient starting point. This is also the boundary between [[Bournemouth]] and Christchurch.\n\n===North side===\nFrom [[Tuckton|Tuckton Bridge]] along the River Stour there are river front properties up to the Captains Club hotel which is located on the west end of a quay and open space known locally as ''The Quomps'' this is overlooked by [[Christchurch Priory]] at the eastern end. The River Avon joins the Stour alongside the Priory. Across the Avon are ''Priory'' and ''Grimbury Marsh'' then the larger ''Stanpit Marsh (see below)'', ''Blackberry point'' which is an island at High Water is to the east of the marsh. Further east are the residential areas of [[Stanpit]] and [[Mudeford]]. At the eastern end of the harbour is Mudeford Quay, and the harbour entrance which is a relatively narrow channel, named ''The Run'',<ref>University of Southampton geological survey</ref> the coast eastward and open to the sea leads to [[Highcliffe]], the next coastal village.\n\n===South side===\nFrom [[Tuckton|Tuckton Bridge]], the two main sections of the harbour shore are [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]] and [[Hengistbury Head]], which are in [[Southbourne, Dorset|Southbourne]] a suburb of Bournemouth. The harbour proper begins around ''Wick Fields'', a reed marsh and part of the area of importance for nature conservation. The [[Hengistbury Head]] Activities Centre is situated on the shore just before ''Barn Bight''. [[Hengistbury Head]] on the south shore was threatened during the nineteenth century by the mining of ironstone ''doggers'' which dramatically increased erosion. The silt washed into that part of the harbour threatened the ecology and to prevent this, the ''Quarry Pool'' was created on the headland by building a dam in 1976. ''Holloway's Dock'' cuts into the land before the shore reaches [[Mudeford]] Sandbank which juts northwards towards ''The Run''. The sandbank is the home to many [[Beach hut]]s, a cafe and the terminus for the Hengistbury Head [[Land train|Land Train]].\n\n==Stanpit Marsh==\n{{Main|Stanpit Marsh}}\nAlong part of the south west side of the [[Stanpit]] road is Stanpit Marsh. It was formed as the result of action and deposition of material from the rivers [[River Stour, Dorset|Stour]] and [[River Avon (Hampshire)|Avon]] as they meet with the salt water within Christchurch Harbour.

The company employs over 3,000 people and has operations nationwide, with its main offices based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The company is part of [[New Zealand Telecommunications Forum]].\n\nThe company has invested millions of dollars in its [[3G]] network, improving capacity in congested urban areas. It has New Zealand's first 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] network and continues to maintain its 2G network. In February 2013, Vodafone New Zealand launched their LTE network which is currently available in 54 centres in total.

In areas with high demand there are additional GSM services operating in the 1800&nbsp;MHz band, usually from existing 900&nbsp;MHz cell sites, to provide more capacity. Areas with both 900&nbsp;MHz and 1800&nbsp;MHz service cover most major business districts and large shopping malls. In recent years Vodafone has also established some cell sites that only provide 1800&nbsp;MHz service where it is difficult to release spectrum for more 900&nbsp;MHz cell sites. Most phones sold since the mid-1990s support both bands.\n\nIn March 2016 Vodafone New Zealand announced plans to shut down its 2G (GSM) network,  beginning with voice and messaging services. Vodafone's Spokesperson Elissa Downey commented that they would keep the GSM network running until 2025, although it would only support devices using GSM data such as electricity meters that send readings over the network, and that they would be announcing the end date for its 2G voice service soon.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/77907677/Vodafone-signals-the-end-is-nigh-for-its-2G-voice-service\n|title=Vodafone signals the end is high for its 2G voice service\n|last=Pullar-Strecker\n|first=Tom\n|date=16 March 2016\n|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand\n|website=Stuff\n|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> In early August 2016, however, it was reported that Vodafone was reconsidering its choice to shut down the network, with Spokesperson Andrea Brady stating that the 2G network \"will not be switched off anytime soon as it continues to serve customers across New Zealand\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/vodafone-nz-says-will-maintain-2g-as-long-as-demand--1156661\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806162207/http://www.telecompaper.com/news/vodafone-nz-says-will-maintain-2g-as-long-as-demand--1156661\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=6 August 2016\n|title=Vodafone NZ says will maintain 2G as long as demand\n|date=5 August 2016\n|publisher=Telecom.paper BV\n|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> This announcement came following the company's criticism of rival operator [[Spark New Zealand|Spark]]'s billboard campaign that claimed \"Vodafone's 2G network is shutting down\" and invited customers to \"switch before [they're] ditched\",<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.geekzone.co.NZ/sbiddle/8906 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730153000/http://www.geekzone.co.nz/sbiddle/8906 \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-date=30 July 2016 \n |title=Skinny takes FUD to new heights with Vodafone GSM network shutdown billboards. \n |date=29 July 2016 \n |last=Biddle \n |first=Steve \n |website=Geekzone \n |access-date=28 December 2016 \n}}</ref> despite neither Spark, nor its child division Skinny Mobile \u2013 whom the campaign was run under \u2013 operating a compatible 2G network. The campaign was denounced by Vodafone as \"pretty misleading\", shortly followed by the announcement that 2G voice services would not be ended any time soon.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stuff.co.NZ/business/industries/82856451/Vodafone-backs-away-from-naming-date-for-closure-of-2G-voice-network\n|title=Vodafone backs away from naming date for closure of 2G voice network\n|date=5 August 2016\n|last=Pullar-Strecker\n|first=Tom\n|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand\n|website=Stuff\n|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> As of December 2016 Vodafone has not confirmed a date for the termination of its 2G voice network.\n\n==== UMTS Coverage (3G) ====\nIn the main centres, Vodafone operates UMTS (3G) service using the 2100&nbsp;MHz band. UMTS service is often provided from the same cell site as 900&nbsp;MHz and/or 1800&nbsp;MHz GSM services. Most of the existing 900&nbsp;MHz sites were built in the 1990s when it was not expected that a 2100&nbsp;MHz network would be built, hence the existing 900&nbsp;MHz network was not at all optimised for 2100&nbsp;MHz service. Due to the fact that 900&nbsp;MHz and 1800&nbsp;MHz signals propagate further than 2100&nbsp;MHz signals, there were many areas beyond 2100&nbsp;MHz coverage where UMTS phones would have to hand down to 900&nbsp;MHz or 1800&nbsp;MHz GSM service. In recent years Vodafone has established many individual 2100&nbsp;MHz UMTS sites to enhance 3G coverage.\n\nIn rural areas, Vodafone has installed 900&nbsp;MHz UMTS (3G) service alongside their existing 900&nbsp;MHz GSM (2G) service. The 900&nbsp;MHz UMTS service has roughly the same coverage area as 900&nbsp;MHz GSM service, so instances of UMTS service being handed down to GSM should occur far less often in rural areas than in areas covered by the 2100&nbsp;MHz network. However many older UMTS phones only support 2100&nbsp;MHz service so these phones will hand down to 900&nbsp;MHz GSM even though there is UMTS service available at 900&nbsp;MHz.\n\nRural Broadband Initiative ([[Internet in New Zealand|RBI]]) coverage: Vodafone have a contract with the New Zealand government to provide fixed cellular access to the internet with antennas mounted on the outside of buildings, homes and businesses at speeds of at least 5Mbit/s. Much of the coverage as of 2015 is on 900Mhz 3G (hands down to 2G as a backup). By January 2016, Vodafone has actively extended its 4G network throughout key rural areas, and was on track to deliver speeds as high as 100Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vodafone RBI upgrades bring faster speeds|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=20741|publisher=Geekzone|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nRBI is sold by many ISPs and can include voice services and internet services designed to give similar plans and pricing as landline. Vodafone wholesales RBI services over cellular to many ISPs, any ISP may provide RBI services over cellular, ADSL and UFB fibre, what ever is the available at the customers rural property (urban areas are excluded from RBI offerings).\n\n==== 4G LTE Coverage (4G) ====\nVodafone offers 4G LTE coverage across New Zealand, claiming coverage to over 96% of the population. Vodafone uses frequencies at 700&nbsp;MHz (Band 28), 1800&nbsp;MHz (Band 3), and 2600&nbsp;MHz (Band 7) for 4G.\n\n4G was originally considered an \"add-on\" and was included in three higher level plans<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/mobile-plans/other-on-account-plans/|title=On Account mobile plans|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> and the Vodafone Red plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/red/|title=Red+ The ultimate mobile plan, now with Netflix|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> The 700&nbsp;MHz 4G LTE frequency used in New Zealand is APT band 28 and was first launched by Vodafone in Papakura on 21 July 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://techday.com/telco-review/news/vodafone-first-to-begin-4g-rollout-with-700mhz/188379/ |title=Vodafone first to begin 4G rollout with 700MHz |publisher=Techday |date=2014-07-22 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/550695/vodafone_100_population_coverage_nz_current_terrestrial_technology_unlikely_/|title = Vodafone 100 percent coverage nz unlikely|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Computerworld NZ|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==== 5G NR Coverage (5G) ====\nVodafone launched its 5G service in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], Christchurch and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] on December 10, 2019, with plans to roll out the service to other cities in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20191211/5g/vodafone-launches-commercial-5g-new-zealand|title=Vodafone launches commercial 5G in New Zealand |publisher=RCR Wireless |date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile virtual network service ===\nVodafone NZ also provides services for [[mobile virtual network operator]]s. This means other companies can resell Vodafone's network services (data, telephone and SMS) under their own brand name. Their customers connect to Vodafone's network as any other Vodafone customer would, but instead of seeing \"Vodafone NZ\" as the network operator, they will see the name of the company they pay for these services.\n\nMVNO networks do not have their own cellular equipment, so customers connect to Vodafone's network constantly, instead of jumping between networks. Current MVNOs running on Vodafone's network include: [[Black + White Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Compass Mobile | url = https://business.compass.net.nz/mobile.html | work = Compass Communications | accessdate = November 16, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171117130459/https://business.compass.net.nz/mobile.html | archive-date = 17 November 2017 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis is different from 2degrees, who offloads customers onto the Vodafone network when they are not in a 2degrees mobile coverage zone. 2degrees has a roaming agreement with Vodafone NZ, and as such, their customers roam only on the network when they have no coverage, otherwise they connect to 2degrees' own equipment.\n\n=== Phone numbers ===\nIn New Zealand all mobile phone numbers start with 02. Vodafone is allocated the 021 prefix with other networks being allocated other prefixes \u2013 such as 022 to 2degrees, and 027 to Spark. However [[Local number portability|Number portability]] was introduced to the New Zealand market on 2 April 2007 which means that customers can bring, for example, their 021 prefixed number to Spark or 2degrees. Within New Zealand, the network is sometimes referred to in speech by its prefix\u2014i.e. 'Are you 021?' instead of 'Are you with Vodafone?'.\n\n==== 029 Prefix ====\nVodafone used to operate the 029 prefix on behalf of [[TelstraClear]], in addition to its own 021 prefix. TelstraClear customers, mostly corporates, used to be able to get mobile numbers under this prefix; these customers were billed by TelstraClear instead of being billed directly by Vodafone. In 2007 this agreement lapsed, and in 2008 some of these customers were transitioned to Telecom who serviced them initially with [[CDMA2000]] technology.  Those [[TelstraClear]] 029 customers not transitioned to Telecom New Zealand remained with Vodafone. Subsequently, TelstraClear joined Telecom as a MVNO operator, but that relationship soured and TelstraClear re-signed with Vodafone in 2009<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10582756 |title=Telstra signs 3G deal with Vodafone |work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref> and remains on the Vodafone network.\n\n==== Comparison with 027 Prefix ====\nSpark NZ (formerly Telecom New Zealand), Vodafone's rival, has fixed 10-digit numbers under its 0272-0279 prefix, which allows approximately 7 million possible numbers. Telecom originally had mixed 9-digits and 10-digits number using the older 025 prefix. The 027 prefix with only 10-digit numbers simplified its numbering system at the time of launching its CDMA network. The older 025 prefix was phased out with its now redundant [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] and [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]] networks.\n\n=== 3G services ===\nOn Wednesday 10 August 2005 Vodafone introduced a new [[3G]] network employing the [[UMTS]] technology widely used in Europe and elsewhere. Using this standard, Vodafone now offers [[video telephony|Video Calling]], music downloads, SKY mobile TV and other services from its [[Vodafone live!]] portal.\n\nVodafone began rolling out [[HSPA+]] data services on its UMTS network in 2011; at the time of writing (May 2012), Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch have coverage. HSPA+ is capable of a theoretical maximum 168 Mbit/s download speed and 22 Mbit/s upload speed, although higher speeds are only supported in areas with an excellent radio signal.\n\nVodafone launched [[HD Voice]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/vodafone-launches-hd-voice-early-users-knocked-out-quality|title=Vodafone launches HD Voice}}</ref> on 7 November 2013 - a high definition voice call technology. This technology works over 3G with HD Voice compatible phones on Vodafone to Vodafone voice calls.\n\n=== iPhone ===\n[[File:Entsperrtes iPhone.jpg|thumb|The first model of the iPhone (on the Vodafone network)]]\nThe first iPhone 3G released on 11 July 2008 was sold by Vodafone in [[Auckland]], New Zealand to 22-year-old student Jonny Gladwell at 12:01&nbsp;am [[NZST]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/1901369 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802025754/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/1901369 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2008 |title=Auckland man snaps up first new generation iPhone |publisher=[[TVNZ]] |date=2008-07-11 }}</ref><br /> The iPhone 3G was only available to customers on the Vodafone network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/iphone/|title=The new iPhone.

(The 850&nbsp;MHz 3G band is used by Spark NZ). 900&nbsp;MHz capability was added from the iPhone 3GS and subsequent models of iPhone.\n\nSubsequent launches of iPhone models in New Zealand have typically been a few weeks after the worldwide release. The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5s]] and [[iPhone 5c]] are CAT3 4G devices and can be used on Vodafone's 4G LTE network on the 1800&nbsp;MHz frequency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/iphone5s/|title=iPhone 5s|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models are CAT4 4G devices and also support the APT 700&nbsp;MHz frequency (Band 28) in addition to Vodafone's 1800&nbsp;MHz frequency.\n\n==Fixed-line broadband==\n\n=== ADSL and VDSL2 ===\nVodafone offers copper-based ADSL and VDSL services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/broadband/|title=Internet options with ADSL, VDSL, Fibre and digital TV|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> (Vodafone has previously purchased two other ISPs, Paradise.net and Clearnet.)\n\nVDSL is a faster xDSL technology available to consumers and businesses based on location. This technology will only function within a certain proximity to the local copper exchange. This technology is used to deliver the BizBroadband and BizNet packages, as well as the IP Voice products (IP FeatureLine, IP Connect, IP Gateway, IP Clarity).\n\n=== DOCSIS (cable) ===\nVodafone also offers [[DOCSIS]] cable modem broadband within the former TelstraClear's network.<ref>[http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=29521 TelstraClear to deploy DOCSIS 3.0].

It is delivered over cable and fibre broadband, available in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, Whangarei, Palmerston North and Dunedin.\n\nCustomers receive Freeview channels via a Digital TV recorder and can subscribe to Sky TV channels. No content is sourced by Vodafone itself except 36 Vodafone pay-per-view channels. Selected content is available in High Definition.\n\nIn September 2010 TelstraClear released their own PVR called the T-BOX. The launch followed the release by parent company Telstra (AU) of a similar product.\n\nAs of June 2011, TelstraClear ceased all analogue transmission on its cable network.\n\n===Coverage===\nVodafone's cable network is available in the following areas:\n* most of Wellington City, excluding [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], [[Churton Park]], [[Glenside, New Zealand|Glenside]], Broadmeadows, [[Ngauranga]], [[Kaiwharawhara]], and central Wellington (bound by State Highway 1 and Kent Terrace)\n* [[Lower Hutt]], including [[Wainuiomata]] and [[Stokes Valley]], but excluding [[Haywards]], [[Manor Park, New Zealand|Manor Park]], the western hill suburbs (west of State Highway 2) and eastern bay suburbs (Point Howard to Muritai, including [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]])\n* [[Upper Hutt]], excluding [[T\u014dtara Park]]\n* Kapiti urban area ([[Waikanae]] to [[Paekakariki]])\n* southern and eastern [[Christchurch]], including the suburbs of [[Mairehau]], [[Shirley, New Zealand|Shirley]], [[Richmond, Canterbury|Richmond]], Avonside, [[Dallington, New Zealand|Dallington]], [[Wainoni, Canterbury|Wainoni]], [[Avondale, Canterbury|Avondale]], [[Aranui]], [[Bexley, New Zealand|Bexley]], parts of [[New Brighton, New Zealand|New Brighton]] and North New Brighton, Bromley, [[Linwood, New Zealand|Linwood]], [[Ferrymead]], [[Woolston, New Zealand|Woolston]], [[Opawa]], [[Waltham, New Zealand|Waltham]], [[Sydenham, New Zealand|Sydenham]], Saint Martins, [[Beckenham, New Zealand|Beckenham]], [[Somerfield, New Zealand|Somerfield]], [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]], [[Spreydon]], [[Hoon Hay]], [[Hillmorton]], Middleton, parts of [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]] and Upper Riccarton (south of and including Riccarton Road), [[Sockburn]], Broomfield, Hei Hei, and parts of Islington and [[Hornby, New Zealand|Hornby]].\n\n===Interactive services===\n* Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) - Television listing information.\n* Pay Per View (PPV) Guide - Vodafone Movies listing information.\n\n=== Defunct channels ===\n* [[TechTV]] was available up until May 2004, when current owner [[Comcast]] halted international broadcasts.

It installed switches in Auckland and Wellington to manage incoming and outgoing international traffic and maintained interconnect agreements with Telecom New Zealand, Clear Communications and some smaller service providers.\n\nIn 1999 [[Saturn Communications]] was sold by its parent company, [[Austar]] United Communications, to a new joint venture with Telstra that became known as [[TelstraSaturn]].\n\nTelstraClear was then created by the merger of [[Telstra]]'s TelstraSaturn and Clear Communications in December 2001. Austar United Communications held an initial investment of 42% in TelstraClear before selling it back to Telstra.\n\nIn 2004 TelstraClear made its first acquisition in the IT market with the purchase of Sytec,<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ECZ/is_2004_Dec_8/ai_n8554172/\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100628165427/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ECZ/is_2004_Dec_8/ai_n8554172/\n|url-status = dead\n|archive-date = 2010-06-28\n|title = TelstraClear acquires Sytec | work=Telecomworldwire | year=2004}}</ref> mainly for its IP telephony and security skills, in particular the specialist managed security subsidiary [[DMZGlobal]].

On July 31, 2019 the sale of Vodafone New Zealand Limited to a consortium comprising Infratil Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. was settled.<ref>https://www.bellgully.com/about-us/firm-news/vodafone-group-plc-settles-vodafone-new-zealand-sale-to-consortium</ref> Vodafone is New Zealand's largest [[mobile phone]] operator, based in Auckland, and was formed in 1998, after Vodafone purchased [[BellSouth]]'s New Zealand operations. The company employs over 3,000 people and has operations nationwide, with its main offices based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The company is part of [[New Zealand Telecommunications Forum]].\n\nThe company has invested millions of dollars in its [[3G]] network, improving capacity in congested urban areas. It has New Zealand's first 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] network and continues to maintain its 2G network. In February 2013, Vodafone New Zealand launched their LTE network which is currently available in 54 centres in total.

The remainder of the market is made up of MVNO operators, Skinny with 5% and the rest with 1%. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/regulated-industries/telecommunications/monitoring-reports-and-studies/monitoring-reports/|title=Monitoring reports|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Acquisitions===\nBellSouth had 138,000 customers when it was purchased by Vodafone in  November 1998. The company's main rival was [[Telecom New Zealand]] (now Spark), New Zealand's second largest [[telecommunications]] company behind Vodafone. Telecom had the advantage that it had a 6-year head-start on BellSouth, however this advantage slipped away in recent years.\n\nAfter Vodafone took over Bellsouth, it expanded network coverage to compete more effectively with Telecom. Vodafone has constantly increased its market share and surpassed Telecom in mobile customers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nOn 31 October 2012, Vodafone acquired 100% of [[TelstraClear]] from Australian company [[Telstra]].\n\n==Mobile services==\n\n=== Coverage ===\nVodafone operates a [[GSM]] (2G) mobile phone network at 900&nbsp;MHz and 1800&nbsp;MHz,  a [[UMTS]] (3G) network at 900&nbsp;MHz and 2100&nbsp;MHz, and a 4G [[LTE network]] at 700 MHz, 1800&nbsp;MHz, 2100&nbsp;MHz and 2600&nbsp;MHz. It states that the network provides service in \"Our mobile network covers over 98.5% of the population, with 4G extended coverage to over 93%\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/network/coverage/ |title=Reliable Coverage |publisher=Vodafone New Zealand |accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== GSM Coverage (2G) ====\nVodafone operates a nationwide GSM service in the 900&nbsp;MHz band. In areas with high demand there are additional GSM services operating in the 1800&nbsp;MHz band, usually from existing 900&nbsp;MHz cell sites, to provide more capacity. Areas with both 900&nbsp;MHz and 1800&nbsp;MHz service cover most major business districts and large shopping malls. In recent years Vodafone has also established some cell sites that only provide 1800&nbsp;MHz service where it is difficult to release spectrum for more 900&nbsp;MHz cell sites. Most phones sold since the mid-1990s support both bands.\n\nIn March 2016 Vodafone New Zealand announced plans to shut down its 2G (GSM) network,  beginning with voice and messaging services. Vodafone's Spokesperson Elissa Downey commented that they would keep the GSM network running until 2025, although it would only support devices using GSM data such as electricity meters that send readings over the network, and that they would be announcing the end date for its 2G voice service soon.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/77907677/Vodafone-signals-the-end-is-nigh-for-its-2G-voice-service\n|title=Vodafone signals the end is high for its 2G voice service\n|last=Pullar-Strecker\n|first=Tom\n|date=16 March 2016\n|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand\n|website=Stuff\n|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> In early August 2016, however, it was reported that Vodafone was reconsidering its choice to shut down the network, with Spokesperson Andrea Brady stating that the 2G network \"will not be switched off anytime soon as it continues to serve customers across New Zealand\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/vodafone-nz-says-will-maintain-2g-as-long-as-demand--1156661\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806162207/http://www.telecompaper.com/news/vodafone-nz-says-will-maintain-2g-as-long-as-demand--1156661\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=6 August 2016\n|title=Vodafone NZ says will maintain 2G as long as demand\n|date=5 August 2016\n|publisher=Telecom.paper BV\n|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> This announcement came following the company's criticism of rival operator [[Spark New Zealand|Spark]]'s billboard campaign that claimed \"Vodafone's 2G network is shutting down\" and invited customers to \"switch before [they're] ditched\",<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.geekzone.co.NZ/sbiddle/8906 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730153000/http://www.geekzone.co.nz/sbiddle/8906 \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-date=30 July 2016 \n |title=Skinny takes FUD to new heights with Vodafone GSM network shutdown billboards. \n |date=29 July 2016 \n |last=Biddle \n |first=Steve \n |website=Geekzone \n |access-date=28 December 2016 \n}}</ref> despite neither Spark, nor its child division Skinny Mobile \u2013 whom the campaign was run under \u2013 operating a compatible 2G network. The campaign was denounced by Vodafone as \"pretty misleading\", shortly followed by the announcement that 2G voice services would not be ended any time soon.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stuff.co.NZ/business/industries/82856451/Vodafone-backs-away-from-naming-date-for-closure-of-2G-voice-network\n|title=Vodafone backs away from naming date for closure of 2G voice network\n|date=5 August 2016\n|last=Pullar-Strecker\n|first=Tom\n|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand\n|website=Stuff\n|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> As of December 2016 Vodafone has not confirmed a date for the termination of its 2G voice network.\n\n==== UMTS Coverage (3G) ====\nIn the main centres, Vodafone operates UMTS (3G) service using the 2100&nbsp;MHz band. UMTS service is often provided from the same cell site as 900&nbsp;MHz and/or 1800&nbsp;MHz GSM services. Most of the existing 900&nbsp;MHz sites were built in the 1990s when it was not expected that a 2100&nbsp;MHz network would be built, hence the existing 900&nbsp;MHz network was not at all optimised for 2100&nbsp;MHz service. Due to the fact that 900&nbsp;MHz and 1800&nbsp;MHz signals propagate further than 2100&nbsp;MHz signals, there were many areas beyond 2100&nbsp;MHz coverage where UMTS phones would have to hand down to 900&nbsp;MHz or 1800&nbsp;MHz GSM service. In recent years Vodafone has established many individual 2100&nbsp;MHz UMTS sites to enhance 3G coverage.\n\nIn rural areas, Vodafone has installed 900&nbsp;MHz UMTS (3G) service alongside their existing 900&nbsp;MHz GSM (2G) service. The 900&nbsp;MHz UMTS service has roughly the same coverage area as 900&nbsp;MHz GSM service, so instances of UMTS service being handed down to GSM should occur far less often in rural areas than in areas covered by the 2100&nbsp;MHz network. However many older UMTS phones only support 2100&nbsp;MHz service so these phones will hand down to 900&nbsp;MHz GSM even though there is UMTS service available at 900&nbsp;MHz.\n\nRural Broadband Initiative ([[Internet in New Zealand|RBI]]) coverage: Vodafone have a contract with the New Zealand government to provide fixed cellular access to the internet with antennas mounted on the outside of buildings, homes and businesses at speeds of at least 5Mbit/s. Much of the coverage as of 2015 is on 900Mhz 3G (hands down to 2G as a backup). By January 2016, Vodafone has actively extended its 4G network throughout key rural areas, and was on track to deliver speeds as high as 100Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vodafone RBI upgrades bring faster speeds|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=20741|publisher=Geekzone|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nRBI is sold by many ISPs and can include voice services and internet services designed to give similar plans and pricing as landline. Vodafone wholesales RBI services over cellular to many ISPs, any ISP may provide RBI services over cellular, ADSL and UFB fibre, what ever is the available at the customers rural property (urban areas are excluded from RBI offerings).\n\n==== 4G LTE Coverage (4G) ====\nVodafone offers 4G LTE coverage across New Zealand, claiming coverage to over 96% of the population. Vodafone uses frequencies at 700&nbsp;MHz (Band 28), 1800&nbsp;MHz (Band 3), and 2600&nbsp;MHz (Band 7) for 4G.\n\n4G was originally considered an \"add-on\" and was included in three higher level plans<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/mobile-plans/other-on-account-plans/|title=On Account mobile plans|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> and the Vodafone Red plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/red/|title=Red+ The ultimate mobile plan, now with Netflix|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> The 700&nbsp;MHz 4G LTE frequency used in New Zealand is APT band 28 and was first launched by Vodafone in Papakura on 21 July 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://techday.com/telco-review/news/vodafone-first-to-begin-4g-rollout-with-700mhz/188379/ |title=Vodafone first to begin 4G rollout with 700MHz |publisher=Techday |date=2014-07-22 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/550695/vodafone_100_population_coverage_nz_current_terrestrial_technology_unlikely_/|title = Vodafone 100 percent coverage nz unlikely|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Computerworld NZ|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==== 5G NR Coverage (5G) ====\nVodafone launched its 5G service in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], Chistchurch and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] on December 10, 2019, with plans to roll out the service to other cities in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20191211/5g/vodafone-launches-commercial-5g-new-zealand|title=Vodafone launches commercial 5G in New Zealand |publisher=RCR Wireless |date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile virtual network service ===\nVodafone NZ also provides services for [[mobile virtual network operator]]s. This means other companies can resell Vodafone's network services (data, telephone and SMS) under their own brand name. Their customers connect to Vodafone's network as any other Vodafone customer would, but instead of seeing \"Vodafone NZ\" as the network operator, they will see the name of the company they pay for these services.\n\nMVNO networks do not have their own cellular equipment, so customers connect to Vodafone's network constantly, instead of jumping between networks. Current MVNOs running on Vodafone's network include: [[Black + White Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Compass Mobile | url = https://business.compass.net.nz/mobile.html | work = Compass Communications | accessdate = November 16, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171117130459/https://business.compass.net.nz/mobile.html | archive-date = 17 November 2017 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis is different from 2degrees, who offloads customers onto the Vodafone network when they are not in a 2degrees mobile coverage zone. 2degrees has a roaming agreement with Vodafone NZ, and as such, their customers roam only on the network when they have no coverage, otherwise they connect to 2degrees' own equipment.\n\n=== Phone numbers ===\nIn New Zealand all mobile phone numbers start with 02. Vodafone is allocated the 021 prefix with other networks being allocated other prefixes \u2013 such as 022 to 2degrees, and 027 to Spark. However [[Local number portability|Number portability]] was introduced to the New Zealand market on 2 April 2007 which means that customers can bring, for example, their 021 prefixed number to Spark or 2degrees. Within New Zealand, the network is sometimes referred to in speech by its prefix\u2014i.e. 'Are you 021?' instead of 'Are you with Vodafone?'.\n\n==== 029 Prefix ====\nVodafone used to operate the 029 prefix on behalf of [[TelstraClear]], in addition to its own 021 prefix. TelstraClear customers, mostly corporates, used to be able to get mobile numbers under this prefix; these customers were billed by TelstraClear instead of being billed directly by Vodafone. In 2007 this agreement lapsed, and in 2008 some of these customers were transitioned to Telecom who serviced them initially with [[CDMA2000]] technology.  Those [[TelstraClear]] 029 customers not transitioned to Telecom New Zealand remained with Vodafone. Subsequently, TelstraClear joined Telecom as a MVNO operator, but that relationship soured and TelstraClear re-signed with Vodafone in 2009<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10582756 |title=Telstra signs 3G deal with Vodafone |work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref> and remains on the Vodafone network.\n\n==== Comparison with 027 Prefix ====\nSpark NZ (formerly Telecom New Zealand), Vodafone's rival, has fixed 10-digit numbers under its 0272-0279 prefix, which allows approximately 7 million possible numbers. Telecom originally had mixed 9-digits and 10-digits number using the older 025 prefix. The 027 prefix with only 10-digit numbers simplified its numbering system at the time of launching its CDMA network. The older 025 prefix was phased out with its now redundant [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] and [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]] networks.\n\n=== 3G services ===\nOn Wednesday 10 August 2005 Vodafone introduced a new [[3G]] network employing the [[UMTS]] technology widely used in Europe and elsewhere. Using this standard, Vodafone now offers [[video telephony|Video Calling]], music downloads, SKY mobile TV and other services from its [[Vodafone live!]] portal.\n\nVodafone began rolling out [[HSPA+]] data services on its UMTS network in 2011; at the time of writing (May 2012), Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch have coverage. HSPA+ is capable of a theoretical maximum 168 Mbit/s download speed and 22 Mbit/s upload speed, although higher speeds are only supported in areas with an excellent radio signal.\n\nVodafone launched [[HD Voice]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/vodafone-launches-hd-voice-early-users-knocked-out-quality|title=Vodafone launches HD Voice}}</ref> on 7 November 2013 - a high definition voice call technology. This technology works over 3G with HD Voice compatible phones on Vodafone to Vodafone voice calls.\n\n=== iPhone ===\n[[File:Entsperrtes iPhone.jpg|thumb|The first model of the iPhone (on the Vodafone network)]]\nThe first iPhone 3G released on 11 July 2008 was sold by Vodafone in [[Auckland]], New Zealand to 22-year-old student Jonny Gladwell at 12:01&nbsp;am [[NZST]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/1901369 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802025754/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/1901369 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2008 |title=Auckland man snaps up first new generation iPhone |publisher=[[TVNZ]] |date=2008-07-11 }}</ref><br /> The iPhone 3G was only available to customers on the Vodafone network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/iphone/|title=The new iPhone.

(The 850&nbsp;MHz 3G band is used by Spark NZ). 900&nbsp;MHz capability was added from the iPhone 3GS and subsequent models of iPhone.\n\nSubsequent launches of iPhone models in New Zealand have typically been a few weeks after the worldwide release. The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5s]] and [[iPhone 5c]] are CAT3 4G devices and can be used on Vodafone's 4G LTE network on the 1800&nbsp;MHz frequency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/iphone5s/|title=iPhone 5s|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models are CAT4 4G devices and also support the APT 700&nbsp;MHz frequency (Band 28) in addition to Vodafone's 1800&nbsp;MHz frequency.\n\n==Fixed-line broadband==\n\n=== ADSL and VDSL2 ===\nVodafone offers copper-based ADSL and VDSL services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/broadband/|title=Internet options with ADSL, VDSL, Fibre and digital TV|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> (Vodafone has previously purchased two other ISPs, Paradise.net and Clearnet.)\n\nVDSL is a faster xDSL technology available to consumers and businesses based on location. This technology will only function within a certain proximity to the local copper exchange. This technology is used to deliver the BizBroadband and BizNet packages, as well as the IP Voice products (IP FeatureLine, IP Connect, IP Gateway, IP Clarity).\n\n=== DOCSIS (cable) ===\nVodafone also offers [[DOCSIS]] cable modem broadband within the former TelstraClear's network.<ref>[http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=29521 TelstraClear to deploy DOCSIS 3.0].

It is delivered over cable and fibre broadband, available in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, Whangarei, Palmerston North and Dunedin.\n\nCustomers receive Freeview channels via a Digital TV recorder and can subscribe to Sky TV channels. No content is sourced by Vodafone itself except 36 Vodafone pay-per-view channels. Selected content is available in High Definition.\n\nIn September 2010 TelstraClear released their own PVR called the T-BOX. The launch followed the release by parent company Telstra (AU) of a similar product.\n\nAs of June 2011, TelstraClear ceased all analogue transmission on its cable network.\n\n===Coverage===\nVodafone's cable network is available in the following areas:\n* most of Wellington City, excluding [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], [[Churton Park]], [[Glenside, New Zealand|Glenside]], Broadmeadows, [[Ngauranga]], [[Kaiwharawhara]], and central Wellington (bound by State Highway 1 and Kent Terrace)\n* [[Lower Hutt]], including [[Wainuiomata]] and [[Stokes Valley]], but excluding [[Haywards]], [[Manor Park, New Zealand|Manor Park]], the western hill suburbs (west of State Highway 2) and eastern bay suburbs (Point Howard to Muritai, including [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]])\n* [[Upper Hutt]], excluding [[T\u014dtara Park]]\n* Kapiti urban area ([[Waikanae]] to [[Paekakariki]])\n* southern and eastern [[Christchurch]], including the suburbs of [[Mairehau]], [[Shirley, New Zealand|Shirley]], [[Richmond, Canterbury|Richmond]], Avonside, [[Dallington, New Zealand|Dallington]], [[Wainoni, Canterbury|Wainoni]], [[Avondale, Canterbury|Avondale]], [[Aranui]], [[Bexley, New Zealand|Bexley]], parts of [[New Brighton, New Zealand|New Brighton]] and North New Brighton, Bromley, [[Linwood, New Zealand|Linwood]], [[Ferrymead]], [[Woolston, New Zealand|Woolston]], [[Opawa]], [[Waltham, New Zealand|Waltham]], [[Sydenham, New Zealand|Sydenham]], Saint Martins, [[Beckenham, New Zealand|Beckenham]], [[Somerfield, New Zealand|Somerfield]], [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]], [[Spreydon]], [[Hoon Hay]], [[Hillmorton]], Middleton, parts of [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]] and Upper Riccarton (south of and including Riccarton Road), [[Sockburn]], Broomfield, Hei Hei, and parts of Islington and [[Hornby, New Zealand|Hornby]].\n\n===Interactive services===\n* Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) - Television listing information.\n* Pay Per View (PPV) Guide - Vodafone Movies listing information.\n\n=== Defunct channels ===\n* [[TechTV]] was available up until May 2004, when current owner [[Comcast]] halted international broadcasts.

It installed switches in Auckland and Wellington to manage incoming and outgoing international traffic and maintained interconnect agreements with Telecom New Zealand, Clear Communications and some smaller service providers.\n\nIn 1999 [[Saturn Communications]] was sold by its parent company, [[Austar]] United Communications, to a new joint venture with Telstra that became known as [[TelstraSaturn]].\n\nTelstraClear was then created by the merger of [[Telstra]]'s TelstraSaturn and Clear Communications in December 2001. Austar United Communications held an initial investment of 42% in TelstraClear before selling it back to Telstra.\n\nIn 2004 TelstraClear made its first acquisition in the IT market with the purchase of Sytec,<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ECZ/is_2004_Dec_8/ai_n8554172/\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100628165427/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ECZ/is_2004_Dec_8/ai_n8554172/\n|url-status = dead\n|archive-date = 2010-06-28\n|title = TelstraClear acquires Sytec | work=Telecomworldwire | year=2004}}</ref> mainly for its IP telephony and security skills, in particular the specialist managed security subsidiary [[DMZGlobal]].

Gen Anwar Khan]]\n[[Major General]] '''Raja Muhammad Anwar Khan''' (PA-48) was the first [[Pakistan Army]] [[Engineer Officer]] and the first Muslim [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer In Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. He was the first Muslim to be a Sapper officer in the [[British Indian Army]] and its pre-partition [[Indian Corps of Engineers]]. His Pakistan Army number was 48 (PA-48).\n\n== Ethnicity ==\n\nMaj. General M. Anwar Khan belonged to a Mair [[Minhas]] [[Rajput]] family from Chakwal. The Mair Minhas tribe has a long martial tradition of serving in the British India and Pakistan military.\n\n== Military Background ==\n\nMaj. General M. Anwar Khan belonged to a family of 9 brothers and 4 sisters, of which 6 brothers were selected as officers in the British Army (Akbar, Iftikhar, Zafar, Yousaf, Afzal and Anwar). Three brothers rose to the rank of Major General and three to the rank of Brigadiar General. Three brothers chose civilian careers (Baqir, Tahir and Masud).\n\nAnwar Khan was selected for the 4th batch at Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun in February 1934, and passed out on 3 June 1936. However, his seniority in the army was considered from 1 November 1935. in 1957 he promoted to Maj Gen as Engineer-in-Chief which he served as for eight years. Upon retirement from the Army on 1 May 1965, he served as Chairman OGDC till 1969. Maj Gen Anwar Khan spent the remainder of his retirement years in Rawalpindi, where he passed away on 5 February 2005.\n\nHis eldest brother, [[Muhammed Akbar Khan|Major General Muhammed Akbar Khan]] (PA-1) held the honor to be the first Muslim to become a Major General in the British Indian Army. Akbar Khan enlisted in the army in May 1914 and served with his father's regiment 12th Cavalry. He was a veteran of both World Wars I and II and the first Muslim officer to join the British Indian Cavalry and served in the 5th King Edward's Own (KEO) Probyn's Horse. He was the senior most officer of the Pakistan Army and retired honorably in 1949. [[Iftikhar Khan|Major General Muhammad Iftikhar Khan]], who was educated at RIMC and Sandhurst, was commissioned in August 1929 and joined 7th Light Cavalry. He was transferred to 3rd Cavalry when it was Indianized.\u00a0During Second World War, he served with the newly raised 45th Cavalry. He was the first British Indian officer to be appointed Instructor at the Command and Staff College Quetta, and was tipped as the first Pakistani Commander-in-Chief after General [[Douglas David Gracey]]'s retirement, but died in an air crash with his wife, son and some other senior officers in 1949 at Jang Shahi. Iftikhar was a multi-handicap polo player also. Brigadier [[Muhammed Zafar Khan]] was commissioned in 1934 and was the first non-British Indian Commander of British Indian Cavalry.\u00a0He retired as Director Remount, Veterinary & Farm Corps (RV&FC). Brigadier Muhammad Yousef Khan was commissioned in 1935 and retired as Director RV&FC.\u00a0Brigadier Muhammad Afzal Khan was commissioned in 1935 and joined 16th Light Cavalry.\u00a0He later transferred to Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC).\n\nGeneral Anwar's father Khan Bahadur Raja Fazal Dad Khan was a Zamindar (landowner) and served as a Viceroy's Commissioned Officer with the 12th Cavalry unit of the British Indian Army. He was also granted the title of [[Khan Bahadur]].\n\n== Family Background ==\n\nMajor General M. Anwar Khan (PA-48) belonged to the martial family of Maayr-Minhas Rajputs from Chakwal \u2013 the town that was not only founded many centuries ago by his ancestors, but which also bears the name of his forefather. Around 1860 the family's lands and properties in the Chakwal area were confiscated by the British, under the orders of Brigadier General John Nicholson, for rising against them. Later, General Anwar's elder uncle Raja Aurangzeb Khan made peace with the British, by seeking employment under Col. Warburton for the settlement and development of the newly irrigated agricultural lands, and the establishment of the newly planned town of Lyallpur. Subsequently, General Anwar's father, Khan Bahadur Raja Muhammad Fazaldad Khan, served in the 12th Cavalry of the British Indian Army for 35 years, and rose to be the Indian commander. (On his retirement Raja Fazaldad Khan became the leading horse and cattle breeder and agricultural land developer in the Lyallpur (Faisalabad)/Jaranwala and Sahiwal/Okara areas of undivided Punjab). General Anwar's cousin Raja Muhammad Sarfraz Khan, who was the eldest son of Raja Aurangzeb Khan, helped redeem the position of the family at Chakwal, and became a prominent politician of the Muslim League and a close friend and associate of the Quaid-e-Azam and Allama Muhammad Iqbal. Raja Sarfraz Khan was also an agriculturist par-excellence and well known for his foresight, philanthropy and socio-development work.\n\nOut of General Anwar's nine brothers, three brothers chose civilian careers (Baqir, Tahir and Masud). Raja Muhammad Baqir Khan, died very young as a law student at Cambridge University UK, when he met with a motorcycle accident. Raja Tahir Raza Khan became an international lawyer, and [[Masud Khan|Raja Masud Raza Khan]] was a psycho-analyst of international repute, and many of his books are still being used as text-books at leading universities in the UK, US and France. Tahir and Masud were settled in London. His maternal first cousins include [[Zulfiqar Ali Khan|Air Chief Marshal Agha Zulfiqar Ali Khan]], Lt Gen Agha Saadat Ali Khan, Lt Gen Agha Nek Muhammad and Senator Dr Nighat Agha. General Anwar's only son, Engr Raja Idrees M. Anwar was Chief Research Officer and Director General of the National Institute of Electronics. His eldest sister's granddaughter is Dr Maleeha Lodhi.\n\n== Education ==\n\nAfter early schooling at Lahore, young Anwar Khan was selected as a cadet at the age of 12 years, in the [[Rashtriya Indian Military College|Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College]] (RIMC) in Dehra Dun (India). He was in the Kitchener Section, as were some of his elder brothers. He became the \u201cCadet Captain\u201d (Senior Prefect) and was awarded \u2018colours\u2019 in cricket and hockey, and won the \u2018Best Athlete\u2019 cup. It was reported a few years ago, that some of his athletic records at RIMC remain unbroken. He was also awarded the \u2018Silver Medallion\u2019 for efficiency in swimming by the Royal Life Saving Society London. He obtained the Chiefs College Diploma and stood first in all the \u2018cadet colleges\u2019 in India, for which he was awarded the \u201cSir Pratap Singh Memorial Prize\u201d.\n\nA very keen photographer, he took photographs whilst at RIMC with his own camera at the opening ceremony of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun. These became the official photographs of IMA, because the ones taken by the professional photographer came out bad owing to some problem with the pro-camera.\n\nHe obtained the \u2018Civil Engineering\u2019 degree with \u2018Honours\u2019 from the Thomason College of Civil Engineering, Roorkee (India), and was awarded the \u201cOlympic Cup\u201d for representing the college at all games, namely; Cricket, Hockey, Football, Tennis and Squash. The principal described him as \u201ca rare combination of brain and brawn\u201d.\n\nIn February 1934 he was selected for the 4th batch at Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun. He passed the 1st Class P.T. and was awarded the \u201csilver spurs\u201d in horse-riding, and represented the IMA in cricket and athletics. He was awarded the \u201cNorman Gold Medal\u201d for standing first in the final examination and was runner-up for the Sword of Honour award, when he passed out on 3 June 1936. However, his seniority in the army was considered from 1 November 1935, as British cadets at Sandhurst did 18 months course, as compared to 30 months at IMA Dehra Dun.\n\n== Army Service ==\n\nHe was the first Muslim to be selected for Engineers, and posted to 31 Field Troop in the King George's Own, Bengal Sappers and Miners Roorkee in July 1936, where he did a \u201cBasic (Combat) Engineering Course\u201d. He volunteered for the South Waziristan operations where he served at Wana from Jun-Sep 37 in the 4th Field Company, and learned practical road and bridge making during operations. The local pathans admired him and were very pleased to see a Muslim working as an Engineer officer. Subsequently, he served in various Engineer units of the 7th Division, with postings and operational duties in Rawalpindi, Batrasi, Shinkiari and Nowshera. He was in 5 Field Company at Rawalpindi from Aug 39 to Jul 40, 7 Field Company from Sep 40 to Mar 41. Adjutant 7th Division Engineers from Mar 41 to Feb 43. Lt Col H. Barker was the Commander Royal Engineers for both Troops and MES Rawalpindi and 7 Division camp at Batrasi Camp, Hazara. The roads and water supply were built by him in two months for Div HQ Batrasi, one brigade at Bakrial, one brigade at Hamsherian and British gunners at Shinkiari. In Dec 42, the 7th Division crossed on a country boat bridge built by Engineers at the site of now Tarbela Dam and camped at Nowshera. In Jan 43 the 7th Division moved to Chindwara in Central India for training in jungle warfare, as Rommel had been defeated in North Africa, and no more desert warfare was anticipated. From Feb-Jul 43 he attended the Command and Staff College Quetta and was awarded PSC on graduation.\n\nDuring World War II, he spent 3 years in the Burma operations in 23rd Engineer Battalion and was \u201cmentioned in despatches\u201d for his service and was promoted to Lt.Col. During this period he was involved in various military combat engineering operations, such as building roads, wooden (tank crossing) bridges, forward airfields, river jetties etc. in Arakan-Akyab area in 1944 and from Assam right through Burma to Rangoon. In Arakan-Akyab area, along the sea, they were a SEAC unit, where tank wooden crossings were often damaged by \u201clifting\u201d at high tide. He was 2nd in-command to Lt Col Sandeman and built roads, bridges and jetties for inland transport. During a voyage from Chittagong towards Akyab a tornado hit their small ship, with waves going over the ship, it developed a list of 15 degrees for about 20 minutes, but luckily the eye of the storm abated, and they sailed safely to the shore. After a year, 23 Engr Bn was shifted to Assam and came under 15 Corps, and made bridges roads and forward airfields, enabling the troops to advance to Rangoon. He was promoted to Lt.Col on 23 Aug 45 at Toungoo, on the way to Rangoon, where he rebuilt the bombed out Mingladon (Rangoon) airfield in 21 nights, whilst keeping it operational during daytime.\n\nOn return from Burma in Nov 46 he did a special Commander Royal Engineers\u2019 (CRE's) course at Roorkee and was posted as Garrison Engineer Meerut in Jan 47 for four months training. After this he was appointed Asst Comdt of the Bengal Sappers and Miners (S&M) Roorkee to prepare for Partition. On 12 August 47, he went to Rawalpindi and Sialkot with his Commandant Col Conner for reconnaissance, and celebrated Pakistan's Independence on 14 August 47 at Sialkot. On 16 Aug 47 he started his journey back to Roorkee (now in hostile India) by train from Rawalpindi, which was diverted from Lahore to Ludhiana via Ferozpur. All stations en-route were full of armed belligerent killers, but luckily the train was not attacked along the way.\n\nFrom Roorkee he went to New Delhi on 3 Sep 47, for the sharing of Engineer property. E-in-C India agreed that Pakistan's share of one-third of the total should only be from Roorkee, which included the mess silver. (Later India-Pakistan Joint Defence Council changed the rules, but by then we had taken most of our share). On 7 Sep 47 when he and his family went to Willingdon airport (Delhi) for flying to Lahore, timely information allowed them to leave the airport just before the biggest killing of Muslims at the airport. He returned to the airport an hour later, but another miracle saved him during a renewed killing attack. This process was repeated on subsequent days, but on 10 Sep 47 he and his family (wife and young son) were safely evacuated to Karachi from Palam airport (Delhi), and then to Rawalpindi by PAF aircraft.\n\nHe moved to Sialkot and established the new Engineer Centre. Meanwhile, back at Roorkee, Maj J. A. Faruqi (later Major General) arranged to send Pakistan's share of equipment etc. to Sialkot. Later in Oct 47 an MT convoy headed by Capt Tufail Ahmed (later colonel) brought most of Pakistan's share from Roorkee to Sialkot. The Indians stopped the convoy and ordered it to be unloaded near Amritsar (as according to the new rule, MT was not to be moved across borders). After a vehement and heated argument with the Indians, the convoy was eventually allowed to go through to Lahore.\n\nPakistan's Corps of Engineers was now fully established and the new motto was \u201cRooheh-Rawan\u201d. The Engineers Centre and School of Military Engineering (SME) were set up at former British barracks in the north of Sialkot. Both became fully functional in a very short time. The big task was to integrate the Bengal S&M with the Bombay S&M personnel, but the \u201cPakistan feeling\u201d was so strong and overwhelming, that unity was soon achieved. Their first task was in dealing with Indian excursions on the border. During this period Lt Col Anwar was the Asst. Commandant of the Engineer Centre and SME. After a year the Comdt Col Conner went on long leave and he acted as Comdt from 7 Jul 48 to 22 Nov 48 as a full Colonel. (Later as Dy E-in-C he moved both the Centre and School to Risalpur, to ensure training on bridging rivers etc.).\n\nOn Connor's return, being the senior most Pakistani engineer officer he was posted to GHQ for training ---- Five months as AAG(org) in AG's branch (22 Nov 48 \u2013 6 May 49)  and then GSO I (SD) for four months in GS branch, directly under Maj Gen Hutton. The property division with India was again argued, because of the new Joint Partition Council rules and E-in-C (Gen Sir Millis Jefferies), Col Connor and Col Anwar flew to New Delhi in Apr 49, but the final decision was to observe a \u201cstatus quo\u201d. For further training he was posted on 1st Sep 49 as CMES Rawalpindi - in those days covering: Pindi, Abbottabad, Murree, Jehlum, Sargodha, Mianwali and Attock.\n\nIn early 1950 he was posted as Dy E-in-C in the rank of Col. The then E-in-C, Maj Gen Veitch, made him fully responsible for all future planning of officers and men. For training purposes he was sent in March 51 to School of Military Engineering (SME) Chatham (UK), Military College of Science, Loughborough College (UK), Survey training centre (UK), Transport training centre (UK) and BAOR (West Germany).\n\nHe was promoted to Brigadier in 1951. In 1955 he went to Jordan, as head of a mission from Pakistan, at the marriage of King Hussein. Subsequently, he visited Damascus and Beirut. In 1956 he visited USA Corps of Engineers Centre at Fort Belvoir and the Waterways Research Centre at Vicksburg.\n\nDuring the period as Dy E-in-C he fixed the ratio of 75% Engr officers and 25% civilian officers in the Military Engineering Service (MES). Later his perseverance to get the degree at Military College of Engineering (MCE) Risalpur, proved successful at a conference of all the Vice Chancellors of the then universities in Pakistan. He strived very hard to establish a world class university of engineering and technology near Rawalpindi ---- A dream that has eventually been realised as the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST).  He also made and arranged to implement the difficult decision, to remove or transfer to other arms, any engineer officer found unfit for the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAll Azad Kashmir roads and bridges were planned by him and work executed by the Corps of Engineers. A road had been planned to be built along the Indus River through Chilas and Gilgit, but for many months no progress was made on the project because Pak PWD, NF PWD and AK PWD said that it was not possible to build it. Gen Veitch asked him (Brig Anwar) to consider if the project could be implemented by the Corps of Engineers. He accepted the challenge, and sent Maj Safdar and a captain as a reconnaissance party, and they walked through dangerous territory until they reached Chilas. From there they took a jeep to Gilgit and reported that it was indeed a difficult but a feasible project. The Secretary Communications Mr Khursheed said that he could only allow them to spend Rs 75 lakhs on the project. The Corps of Engrs started work on building the road. This was one of his most significant achievements, as he was personally involved in planning, designing and supervising the building of a \u201cjeep road on a 3 tonner alignment\u201d, along the Indus River through Chilas and Gilgit, within the meagre budget of only Rs 75 lakhs. This road was eventually widened and extended to China as the Karakoram Highway - a superb feat of engineering by any international standards. (This task was accomplished by FWO, a special force later raised for such projects by the Corps of Engineers). He also contributed towards the building of all military cantonments, especially at Wah, Kharian and Multan. Similarly he provided technical advice for Satellite Town Rawalpindi and the new capital city of Islamabad.\n\nHe was promoted to Maj Gen in 1957 as E-in-C -- a post he held for 8 years. Under his command the Corps of Engineers became one of the finest bodies of professional combat engineers anywhere in the world. This was proved initially, when Pakistani Engineer officers who participated in military engineering courses in the US, were in the top 10 percent of the class. They were competing with officers from other countries as well as US army engineer officers. The fact was further vindicated when retired and serving officers of the Corps of Engineers excelled in whichever assignment they were given, and in any military or civilian organisations they subsequently joined.\n\nOn 1 May 1965 he retired from the Army, and Maj Gen J.A. Faruqi took over. \n\n== Other distinctions ==\n\nAfter retiring from the Pakistan Army, Maj General Anwar Khan was subsequently appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Oil and Gas Corporation for four years, during which oil was struck at Tut near Taunsa, DG Khan, and gas near Karachi and in the then East Pakistan. Despite strong resistance from some quarters, he bought a large industrial plot in 1968 in I-9 Islamabad at a rate of Rs 10/- per sq yd, and a commercial plot in the Blue area for HQ office at an equally low rate. The value of this urban property is extremely high today.\n\nHis strategy and mission at OGDC was to make Pakistani engineers, technologists and scientists learn and apply the skills and technologies required for attaining the highest level of competence and expertise, in all disciplines and specializations including the petroleum industry. This strategy continues to be driven by the current day OGDCL.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the Institute of Engineers Pakistan (IEP), and later elected as its President three times. He used to get the maximum number of votes from East-Pakistanis, and was one of those West-Pakistanis who were very highly admired and respected by them. He was made a Life Fellow of IEP and later given the Lifetime Achievement Award for his many contributions to the engineering profession.\n\nFor many years he was the President of the Rawalpindi Division Cricket Board and the Rawalpindi Division Hockey Board, and responsible for nurturing world class players and sportsmen. He captained the Pakistan Army Cricket Team (as a brigadier in the 1950s), and continued to bowl at an extremely fast pace, more accurately than most others who were many years younger to him, during the time when the test cricketer Imtiaz Ahmed was captain of the Pakistan Airforce Cricket Team.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Pakistan's Drift into Extremism, Hassan Abbas, 2005\n* Pakistani Generals, A.

Gen Anwar Khan]]\n[[Major General]] '''Raja Muhammad Anwar Khan''' (PA-48) was the first [[Pakistan Army]] [[Engineer Officer]] and the first Muslim [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer In Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. He was the first Muslim to be a Sapper officer in the [[British Indian Army]] and its pre-partition [[Indian Corps of Engineers]]. His Pakistan Army number was 48 (PA-48).\n\n== Ethnicity ==\n\nMaj. General M. Anwar Khan belonged to a Mair [[Minhas]] [[Rajput]] family from Chakwal. The Mair Minhas tribe has a long martial tradition of serving in the British India and Pakistan military.\n\n== Military Background ==\n\nMaj. General M. Anwar Khan belonged to a family of 9 brothers and 4 sisters, of which 6 brothers were selected as officers in the British Army (Akbar, Iftikhar, Zafar, Yousaf, Afzal and Anwar). Three brothers rose to the rank of Major General and three to the rank of Brigadiar General. Three brothers chose civilian careers (Baqir, Tahir and Masud).\n\nAnwar Khan was selected for the 4th batch at Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun in February 1934, and passed out on 3 June 1936. However, his seniority in the army was considered from 1 November 1935. in 1957 he promoted to Maj Gen as Engineer-in-Chief which he served as for eight years. Upon retirement from the Army on 1 May 1965, he served as Chairman OGDC till 1969. Maj Gen Anwar Khan spent the remainder of his retirement years in Rawalpindi, where he passed away on 5 February 2005.\n\nHis eldest brother, [[Muhammed Akbar Khan|Major General Muhammed Akbar Khan]] (PA-1) held the honor to be the first Muslim to become a Major General in the British Indian Army. Akbar Khan enlisted in the army in May 1914 and served with his father's regiment 12th Cavalry. He was a veteran of both World Wars I and II and the first Muslim officer to join the British Indian Cavalry and served in the 5th King Edward's Own (KEO) Probyn's Horse. He was the senior most officer of the Pakistan Army and retired honorably in 1949. [[Iftikhar Khan|Major General Muhammad Iftikhar Khan]], who was educated at RIMC and Sandhurst, was commissioned in August 1929 and joined 7th Light Cavalry. He was transferred to 3rd Cavalry when it was Indianized.\u00a0During Second World War, he served with the newly raised 45th Cavalry. He was the first British Indian officer to be appointed Instructor at the Command and Staff College Quetta, and was tipped as the first Pakistani Commander-in-Chief after General [[Douglas David Gracey]]'s retirement, but died in an air crash with his wife, son and some other senior officers in 1949 at Jang Shahi. Iftikhar was a multi-handicap polo player also. Brigadier [[Muhammed Zafar Khan]] was commissioned in 1934 and was the first non-British Indian Commander of British Indian Cavalry.\u00a0He retired as Director Remount, Veterinary & Farm Corps (RV&FC). Brigadier Muhammad Yousef Khan was commissioned in 1935 and retired as Director RV&FC.\u00a0Brigadier Muhammad Afzal Khan was commissioned in 1935 and joined 16th Light Cavalry.\u00a0He later transferred to Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC).\n\nGeneral Anwar's father Khan Bahadur Raja Fazal Dad Khan was a Zamindar (landowner) and served as a Viceroy's Commissioned Officer with the 12th Cavalry unit of the British Indian Army. He was also granted the title of [[Khan Bahadur]].\n\n== Family Background ==\n\nMajor General M. Anwar Khan (PA-48) belonged to the martial family of Maayr-Minhas Rajputs from Chakwal \u2013 the town that was not only founded many centuries ago by his ancestors, but which also bears the name of his forefather. Around 1860 the family's lands and properties in the Chakwal area were confiscated by the British, under the orders of Brigadier General John Nicholson, for rising against them. Later, General Anwar's elder uncle Raja Aurangzeb Khan made peace with the British, by seeking employment under Col. Warburton for the settlement and development of the newly irrigated agricultural lands, and the establishment of the newly planned town of Lyallpur. Subsequently, General Anwar's father, Khan Bahadur Raja Muhammad Fazaldad Khan, served in the 12th Cavalry of the British Indian Army for 35 years, and rose to be the Indian commander. (On his retirement Raja Fazaldad Khan became the leading horse and cattle breeder and agricultural land developer in the Lyallpur (Faisalabad)/Jaranwala and Sahiwal/Okara areas of undivided Punjab). General Anwar's cousin Raja Muhammad Sarfraz Khan, who was the eldest son of Raja Aurangzeb Khan, helped redeem the position of the family at Chakwal, and became a prominent politician of the Muslim League and a close friend and associate of the Quaid-e-Azam and Allama Muhammad Iqbal. Raja Sarfraz Khan was also an agriculturist par-excellence and well known for his foresight, philanthropy and socio-development work.\n\nOut of General Anwar's nine brothers, three brothers chose civilian careers (Baqir, Tahir and Masud). Raja Muhammad Baqir Khan, died very young as a law student at Cambridge University UK, when he met with a motorcycle accident. Raja Tahir Raza Khan became an international lawyer, and [[Masud Khan|Raja Masud Raza Khan]] was a psycho-analyst of international repute, and many of his books are still being used as text-books at leading universities in the UK, US and France. Tahir and Masud were settled in London. His maternal first cousins include [[Zulfiqar Ali Khan|Air Chief Marshal Agha Zulfiqar Ali Khan]], Lt Gen Agha Saadat Ali Khan, Lt Gen Agha Nek Muhammad and Senator Dr Nighat Agha. General Anwar's only son, Engr Raja Idrees M. Anwar was Chief Research Officer and Director General of the National Institute of Electronics. His eldest sister's granddaughter is Dr Maleeha Lodhi.\n\n== Education ==\n\nAfter early schooling at Lahore, young Anwar Khan was selected as a cadet at the age of 12 years, in the [[Rashtriya Indian Military College|Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College]] (RIMC) in Dehra Dun (India). He was in the Kitchener Section, as were some of his elder brothers. He became the \u201cCadet Captain\u201d (Senior Prefect) and was awarded \u2018colours\u2019 in cricket and hockey, and won the \u2018Best Athlete\u2019 cup. It was reported a few years ago, that some of his athletic records at RIMC remain unbroken. He was also awarded the \u2018Silver Medallion\u2019 for efficiency in swimming by the Royal Life Saving Society London. He obtained the Chiefs College Diploma and stood first in all the \u2018cadet colleges\u2019 in India, for which he was awarded the \u201cSir Pratap Singh Memorial Prize\u201d.\n\nA very keen photographer, he took photographs whilst at RIMC with his own camera at the opening ceremony of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun. These became the official photographs of IMA, because the ones taken by the professional photographer came out bad owing to some problem with the pro-camera.\n\nHe obtained the \u2018Civil Engineering\u2019 degree with \u2018Honours\u2019 from the Thomason College of Civil Engineering, Roorkee (India), and was awarded the \u201cOlympic Cup\u201d for representing the college at all games, namely; Cricket, Hockey, Football, Tennis and Squash. The principal described him as \u201ca rare combination of brain and brawn\u201d.\n\nIn February 1934 he was selected for the 4th batch at Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun. He passed the 1st Class P.T. and was awarded the \u201csilver spurs\u201d in horse-riding, and represented the IMA in cricket and athletics. He was awarded the \u201cNorman Gold Medal\u201d for standing first in the final examination and was runner-up for the Sword of Honour award, when he passed out on 3 June 1936. However, his seniority in the army was considered from 1 November 1935, as British cadets at Sandhurst did 18 months course, as compared to 30 months at IMA Dehra Dun.\n\n== Army Service ==\n\nHe was the first Muslim to be selected for Engineers, and posted to 31 Field Troop in the King George's Own, Bengal Sappers and Miners Roorkee in July 1936, where he did a \u201cBasic (Combat) Engineering Course\u201d. He volunteered for the South Waziristan operations where he served at Wana from Jun-Sep 37 in the 4th Field Company, and learned practical road and bridge making during operations. The local pathans admired him and were very pleased to see a Muslim working as an Engineer officer. Subsequently, he served in various Engineer units of the 7th Division, with postings and operational duties in Rawalpindi, Batrasi, Shinkiari and Nowshera. He was in 5 Field Company at Rawalpindi from Aug 39 to Jul 40, 7 Field Company from Sep 40 to Mar 41. Adjutant 7th Division Engineers from Mar 41 to Feb 43. Lt Col H. Barker was the Commander Royal Engineers for both Troops and MES Rawalpindi and 7 Division camp at Batrasi Camp, Hazara. The roads and water supply were built by him in two months for Div HQ Batrasi, one brigade at Bakrial, one brigade at Hamsherian and British gunners at Shinkiari. In Dec 42, the 7th Division crossed on a country boat bridge built by Engineers at the site of now Tarbela Dam and camped at Nowshera. In Jan 43 the 7th Division moved to Chindwara in Central India for training in jungle warfare, as Rommel had been defeated in North Africa, and no more desert warfare was anticipated. From Feb-Jul 43 he attended the Command and Staff College Quetta and was awarded PSC on graduation.\n\nDuring World War II, he spent 3 years in the Burma operations in 23rd Engineer Battalion and was \u201cmentioned in despatches\u201d for his service and was promoted to Lt.Col. During this period he was involved in various military combat engineering operations, such as building roads, wooden (tank crossing) bridges, forward airfields, river jetties etc. in Arakan-Akyab area in 1944 and from Assam right through Burma to Rangoon. In Arakan-Akyab area, along the sea, they were a SEAC unit, where tank wooden crossings were often damaged by \u201clifting\u201d at high tide. He was 2nd in-command to Lt Col Sandeman and built roads, bridges and jetties for inland transport. During a voyage from Chitttagong towards Akyab a tornado hit their small ship, with waves going over the ship, it developed a list of 15 degrees for about 20 minutes, but luckily the eye of the storm abated, and they sailed safely to the shore. After a year, 23 Engr Bn was shifted to Assam and came under 15 Corps, and made bridges roads and forward airfields, enabling the troops to advance to Rangoon. He was promoted to Lt.Col on 23 Aug 45 at Toungoo, on the way to Rangoon, where he rebuilt the bombed out Mingladon (Rangoon) airfield in 21 nights, whilst keeping it operational during daytime.\n\nOn return from Burma in Nov 46 he did a special Commander Royal Engineers\u2019 (CRE's) course at Roorkee and was posted as Garrison Engineer Meerut in Jan 47 for four months training. After this he was appointed Asst Comdt of the Bengal Sappers and Miners (S&M) Roorkee to prepare for Partition. On 12 August 47, he went to Rawalpindi and Sialkot with his Commandant Col Conner for reconnaissance, and celebrated Pakistan's Independence on 14 August 47 at Sialkot. On 16 Aug 47 he started his journey back to Roorkee (now in hostile India) by train from Rawalpindi, which was diverted from Lahore to Ludhiana via Ferozpur. All stations en-route were full of armed belligerent killers, but luckily the train was not attacked along the way.\n\nFrom Roorkee he went to New Delhi on 3 Sep 47, for the sharing of Engineer property. E-in-C India agreed that Pakistan's share of one-third of the total should only be from Roorkee, which included the mess silver. (Later India-Pakistan Joint Defence Council changed the rules, but by then we had taken most of our share). On 7 Sep 47 when he and his family went to Willingdon airport (Delhi) for flying to Lahore, timely information allowed them to leave the airport just before the biggest killing of Muslims at the airport. He returned to the airport an hour later, but another miracle saved him during a renewed killing attack. This process was repeated on subsequent days, but on 10 Sep 47 he and his family (wife and young son) were safely evacuated to Karachi from Palam airport (Delhi), and then to Rawalpindi by PAF aircraft.\n\nHe moved to Sialkot and established the new Engineer Centre. Meanwhile, back at Roorkee, Maj J. A. Faruqi (later Major General) arranged to send Pakistan's share of equipment etc. to Sialkot. Later in Oct 47 an MT convoy headed by Capt Tufail Ahmed (later colonel) brought most of Pakistan's share from Roorkee to Sialkot. The Indians stopped the convoy and ordered it to be unloaded near Amritsar (as according to the new rule, MT was not to be moved across borders). After a vehement and heated argument with the Indians, the convoy was eventually allowed to go through to Lahore.\n\nPakistan's Corps of Engineers was now fully established and the new motto was \u201cRooheh-Rawan\u201d. The Engineers Centre and School of Military Engineering (SME) were set up at former British barracks in the north of Sialkot. Both became fully functional in a very short time. The big task was to integrate the Bengal S&M with the Bombay S&M personnel, but the \u201cPakistan feeling\u201d was so strong and overwhelming, that unity was soon achieved. Their first task was in dealing with Indian excursions on the border. During this period Lt Col Anwar was the Asst. Commandant of the Engineer Centre and SME. After a year the Comdt Col Conner went on long leave and he acted as Comdt from 7 Jul 48 to 22 Nov 48 as a full Colonel. (Later as Dy E-in-C he moved both the Centre and School to Risalpur, to ensure training on bridging rivers etc.).\n\nOn Connor's return, being the senior most Pakistani engineer officer he was posted to GHQ for training ---- Five months as AAG(org) in AG's branch (22 Nov 48 \u2013 6 May 49)  and then GSO I (SD) for four months in GS branch, directly under Maj Gen Hutton. The property division with India was again argued, because of the new Joint Partition Council rules and E-in-C (Gen Sir Millis Jefferies), Col Connor and Col Anwar flew to New Delhi in Apr 49, but the final decision was to observe a \u201cstatus quo\u201d. For further training he was posted on 1st Sep 49 as CMES Rawalpindi - in those days covering: Pindi, Abbottabad, Murree, Jehlum, Sargodha, Mianwali and Attock.\n\nIn early 1950 he was posted as Dy E-in-C in the rank of Col. The then E-in-C, Maj Gen Veitch, made him fully responsible for all future planning of officers and men. For training purposes he was sent in March 51 to School of Military Engineering (SME) Chatham (UK), Military College of Science, Loughborough College (UK), Survey training centre (UK), Transport training centre (UK) and BAOR (West Germany).\n\nHe was promoted to Brigadier in 1951. In 1955 he went to Jordan, as head of a mission from Pakistan, at the marriage of King Hussein. Subsequently, he visited Damascus and Beirut. In 1956 he visited USA Corps of Engineers Centre at Fort Belvoir and the Waterways Research Centre at Vicksburg.\n\nDuring the period as Dy E-in-C he fixed the ratio of 75% Engr officers and 25% civilian officers in the Military Engineering Service (MES). Later his perseverance to get the degree at Military College of Engineering (MCE) Risalpur, proved successful at a conference of all the Vice Chancellors of the then universities in Pakistan. He strived very hard to establish a world class university of engineering and technology near Rawalpindi ---- A dream that has eventually been realised as the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST).  He also made and arranged to implement the difficult decision, to remove or transfer to other arms, any engineer officer found unfit for the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAll Azad Kashmir roads and bridges were planned by him and work executed by the Corps of Engineers. A road had been planned to be built along the Indus River through Chilas and Gilgit, but for many months no progress was made on the project because Pak PWD, NF PWD and AK PWD said that it was not possible to build it. Gen Veitch asked him (Brig Anwar) to consider if the project could be implemented by the Corps of Engineers. He accepted the challenge, and sent Maj Safdar and a captain as a reconnaissance party, and they walked through dangerous territory until they reached Chilas. From there they took a jeep to Gilgit and reported that it was indeed a difficult but a feasible project. The Secretary Communications Mr Khursheed said that he could only allow them to spend Rs 75 lakhs on the project. The Corps of Engrs started work on building the road. This was one of his most significant achievements, as he was personally involved in planning, designing and supervising the building of a \u201cjeep road on a 3 tonner alignment\u201d, along the Indus River through Chilas and Gilgit, within the meagre budget of only Rs 75 lakhs. This road was eventually widened and extended to China as the Karakoram Highway - a superb feat of engineering by any international standards. (This task was accomplished by FWO, a special force later raised for such projects by the Corps of Engineers). He also contributed towards the building of all military cantonments, especially at Wah, Kharian and Multan. Similarly he provided technical advice for Satellite Town Rawalpindi and the new capital city of Islamabad.\n\nHe was promoted to Maj Gen in 1957 as E-in-C -- a post he held for 8 years. Under his command the Corps of Engineers became one of the finest bodies of professional combat engineers anywhere in the world. This was proved initially, when Pakistani Engineer officers who participated in military engineering courses in the US, were in the top 10 percent of the class. They were competing with officers from other countries as well as US army engineer officers. The fact was further vindicated when retired and serving officers of the Corps of Engineers excelled in whichever assignment they were given, and in any military or civilian organisations they subsequently joined.\n\nOn 1 May 1965 he retired from the Army, and Maj Gen J.A. Faruqi took over. \n\n== Other distinctions ==\n\nAfter retiring from the Pakistan Army, Maj General Anwar Khan was subsequently appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Oil and Gas Corporation for four years, during which oil was struck at Tut near Taunsa, DG Khan, and gas near Karachi and in the then East Pakistan. Despite strong resistance from some quarters, he bought a large industrial plot in 1968 in I-9 Islamabad at a rate of Rs 10/- per sq yd, and a commercial plot in the Blue area for HQ office at an equally low rate. The value of this urban property is extremely high today.\n\nHis strategy and mission at OGDC was to make Pakistani engineers, technologists and scientists learn and apply the skills and technologies required for attaining the highest level of competence and expertise, in all disciplines and specializations including the petroleum industry. This strategy continues to be driven by the current day OGDCL.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the Institute of Engineers Pakistan (IEP), and later elected as its President three times. He used to get the maximum number of votes from East-Pakistanis, and was one of those West-Pakistanis who were very highly admired and respected by them. He was made a Life Fellow of IEP and later given the Lifetime Achievement Award for his many contributions to the engineering profession.\n\nFor many years he was the President of the Rawalpindi Division Cricket Board and the Rawalpindi Division Hockey Board, and responsible for nurturing world class players and sportsmen. He captained the Pakistan Army Cricket Team (as a brigadier in the 1950s), and continued to bowl at an extremely fast pace, more accurately than most others who were many years younger to him, during the time when the test cricketer Imtiaz Ahmed was captain of the Pakistan Airforce Cricket Team.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Pakistan's Drift into Extremism, Hassan Abbas, 2005\n* Pakistani Generals, A.
