party, received 8,911 votes or 0.4% of the vote share, but had the votes reassigned to the General Electoral League as a result of them forfeiting their votes out of tactical purposes and were listed as Electoral League or \"Rightist\" votes in the official final results.<ref name=SCB/> No Clerical People's Party member got elected to the Riksdag, which meant the Electoral League covered the entire rightist delegation.<ref name=SCB/> Therefore, the General Electoral League may correctly be attributed to both 23.1% and 23.5% of the overall vote share.\n\n==Constituency

party, received 8,911 votes or 0.4 % of the vote share, but had the votes re-assigned to the General Electoral League as a result of them forfeiting their votes out of tactical purposes and were listed as Electoral League or \"Rightist\" votes in the official final results.<ref name=SCB/> No Clerical People's Party member got elected to the Riksdag, which meant the Electoral League covered the entire rightist delegation.<ref name=SCB/> Therefore the General Electoral League may correctly be attributed to both 23.1 % and 23.5 % of the overall vote share.\n\n==Constituency

Mathes, was a Confederate soldier in the [[American Civil War]], and was born in [[Warren County, Virginia]] in 1836. Robert Israel Mathews was a farmer until the American Civil War began in 1861. He enlisted along with his brother James Mortimer Mathews in the [[49th Virginia Infantry|49th Virginia Infantry regiment]] in the Confederate Army. The two brothers were in the same company together, Company D. The regiment was commanded by [[William Smith (Virginia governor)|William Smith]]. The regiment was nicknamed, \"Extra Billy Smith's Boys\" and was formed in July of 1861. The regiment, as well as Smith, was known in the Army of Northern Virginia as a brave regiment.<ref>http://www.49thvirginiainfantry.com/49th%20Va%20History.htm</ref> Robert notably fought in the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of First Manassas]] on the left flank of the Confederate line on Henry Hill where the Manassas National Battlefield Park Visitor Center is today, [[Battle of Antietam]] at the High Water Mark, [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] where he was wounded in action (WIA) at Prospect Hill, [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Second Bull Run]] at Stony Ridge, [[Battle of Gettysburg]] at Culp's Hill on July 3rd and Seminary Ridge on July 4th, [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] Marye's Heights, and the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] where he would be shot through the jaw. <ref>http://www.49thvirginiainfantry.com/49th%20Va%20History.htm</ref> After the war, Robert told stories to his children and his grandchildren, one of the stories was thought to be of the [[Historic Fairfax County Courthouse|Fairfax Court House]] in 1861 before the [[First Battle of  Bull Run|First Battle of Manassas]] and of [[John Quincy Marr]]. After his death in 1888, his grandchildren found a pair of boots he wore and his grandchildren donated them to the Front Royal Civil War Museum in [[Front Royal, Virginia]].

The family rose to prominence in the second generation, with several members playing a role in the [[American Revolution]]. Overall, seven members were elected to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] over three successive generations from 1774-1865, while additionally members have been involved in the politics of [[West Virginia]], [[Georgia]], and other U.S. states in roles including state governor and state legislator, among others.

In 1787, Clapp married Eliza Wendell Quincy (died 1853, age 90) of Boston. She was the daughter of prominent physician Jacob Quincy and granddaughter of Boston merchant [[Edmund Quincy (1703\u20131788)|Edmund Quincy]]. Clapp was one of Portland's largest merchants at the time of his death. Several of his sons were also major merchants and were elected to political offices; [[Charles Q. Clapp]], for whom the still-standing [[Charles Q. Clapp House]] and [[Charles Q. Clapp Block]] are named, one of them.  Another son, Asa W. H. Clapp, represented [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] in the [[30th United States Congress]] (1847-1849).<ref name=\"Hunt1858\"/>\n\n==Career==\nClapp was appointed a non-commissioned officer for the colonists during the [[American Revolution]]. After the war, Clapp worked as a sailor. He was present in [[Port au Prince]] at the beginning of the Haitian Revolution; he and [[Joseph Peabody assisted the white population against the formerly enslaved rebels. In 1793, Clapp was captured by British officials as part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and detained in England for six months. He was eventually released and compensated for lost cargo. In 1796, he established himself as a merchant in [[Portland, Maine]], which was then part of the state of Massachusetts. In December 1807, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which forbid merchants like Clapp from trading abroad. Though disastrous to his financial interests and the New England shipping economy in general, Clapp supported the measure. In 1811, he served on the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]] under Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]]. Clapp also supported the United States during the [[War of 1812]] despite it severely hurting his business interests.\n\nWhen the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was chartered during the presidency of [[James Madison]], Clapp was the largest subscriber in the District of Maine and was appointed Commissioner, though he did not maintain interest in the Bank for very long.\n\nA supporter of statehood, Clapp was a delegate to the October 1819 Maine statehood convention. After statehood was won, he served in the [[Maine House of Representatives]] from 1820\u20131823.\n\nClapp was a staunch Democrat and, at the age of 85 in 1847, briefly hosted President [[James K.

In 1787, Clapp married Eliza Wendell Quincy (died 1853, age 90) of Boston. She was the daughter of prominent physician Jacob Quincy and grand-daughter of Boston merchant [[Edmund Quincy (1703\u20131788)|Edmund Quincy]]. Clapp was one of Portland's largest merchants at the time of his death. Several of his sons were also major merchants and were elected to political offices; [[Charles Q. Clapp]], for whom the still-standing [[Charles Q. Clapp House]] and [[Charles Q. Clapp Block]] are named, one of them.  Another son, Asa W. H. Clapp, represented [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] in the [[30th United States Congress]] (1847-1849).<ref name=\"Hunt1858\"/>\n\n==Career==\nClapp was appointed a non-commissioned officer for the colonists during the [[American Revolution]]. After the war, Clapp worked as a sailor. He was present in [[Port au Prince]] at the beginning of the Haitian Revolution; he and [[Joseph Peabody assisted the white population against the formerly enslaved rebels. In 1793, Clapp was captured by British officials as part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and detained in England for six months. He was eventually released and compensated for lost cargo. In 1796, he established himself as a merchant in [[Portland, Maine]], which was then part of the state of Massachusetts. In December 1807, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which forbid merchants like Clapp from trading abroad. Though disastrous to his financial interests and the New England shipping economy in general, Clapp supported the measure. In 1811, he served on the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]] under Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]]. Clapp also supported the United States during the [[War of 1812]] despite it severely hurting his business interests.\n\nWhen the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was chartered during the presidency of [[James Madison]], Clapp was the largest subscriber in the District of Maine and was appointed Commissioner, though he did not maintain interest in the Bank for very long. \n\nA supporter of statehood, Clapp was a delegate to the October 1819 Maine statehood convention.
