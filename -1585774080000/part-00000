The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012.

There was a slight decline in economic activity shortly after World War I with [[J.R. Booth]]'s construction of a rival town, [[Depot Harbour, Ontario|Depot Harbour]] on nearby [[Parry Island, Ontario|Parry Island]], but this setback was overcome through later developments in tourism and commerce, and the accidental destruction by fire of the entire town of Depot Harbour on August 14, 1945.\n\nThe body of water that gives the town its name was surveyed and named by Captain [[Henry Bayfield]] in the 19th century, in honour of the Arctic explorer Sir [[William Edward Parry]]. In 1857, the modern townsite was established near the [[Ojibwa]] village of [[Wasauksing First Nation|Wasauksing]] (\"shining shore\") at the mouth of the [[Seguin River]]. Parry Sound was incorporated as a town in 1887.  In the late 19th century, [[railway|rail]] service was established, making the town an important depot along the rail lines to [[Western Canada]].\n\nIn 1916, a [[cordite]] factory was established in the nearby town of [[Nobel, Ontario|Nobel]] for the [[Imperial Munitions Board]]. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an [[explosives]] and [[munitions]] factory was also built at Nobel, making Parry Sound an important part of both the First World War and the Second World War effort.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:downtownParrySound.jpg|thumb|left|View of downtown Parry Sound near the intersection of Seguin and James Streets. A portion of the Sound and the CP railway trestle can be seen in the distance.]]\nParry Sound is the birthplace of hockey legend [[Bobby Orr]], the namesake of the local community centre and the town's own [[Bobby Orr Hall of Fame]]. In Orr's best-selling autobiography, ''[[Orr: My Story (book)|Orr: My Story]]'', he speaks highly of Parry Sound, the friends and family who resided there and the happy childhood he had living in that part of Canada.<ref>Orr, Bobby (2013) ''Bobby Orr: My Story''.

Former Ontario premier [[Ernie Eves]] also called the town home for many years; he was the [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] for the [[Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka (provincial electoral district)|Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka]] riding from 1981 through 2001.\n\nThe town is home to several cultural festivals, including the [[Festival of the Sound]] classical music festival, an annual [[dragonboat]] race and a [[buskers]]' festival which takes place as part of the town's [[Canada Day]] festivities. The [[Charles W. Stockey Centre for the Performing Arts]] serves as the principal performance venue during the Festival of the Sound, and also hosts concerts, live theatre and other cultural events throughout the year.\n\n==Recreation and sports==\nThere are several [[provincial park]]s in the Parry Sound area, including [[Oastler Lake Provincial Park|Oastler Lake]], [[The Massasauga Provincial Park|The Massasauga]] and [[Killbear Provincial Park|Killbear]], as well as numerous provincial [[Nature Reserve Park (Ontario)|conservation reserve]]s, including the Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve, one of only 13 UNESCO sites in Canada. The eastern coast of Georgian Bay where Parry Sound is located is known as the \"30,000 Islands\" and is considered the world's largest freshwater archipelago.  It covers 347,000 hectares of shoreline ecosystem, and over 100 species of animals and plants that are at risk in Canada and Ontario, including unique reptiles and amphibians.  Parry Sound's Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary<ref>[http://www.aspenvalleywildlifesanctuary.com Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary]</ref> cares for injured and orphaned animals, and offers an informational and interpretive centre for wildlife education.  A 230-kilometre recreational trail, the Park-to-Park Trail, connects Killbear with [[Algonquin Provincial Park]] in two locations, to the south at [[Dwight, Ontario|Dwight]], and farther north, east of [[Kearney, Ontario|Kearney]].<ref>[http://www.parktoparktrail.com/ The Park-to-Park Trail]</ref>\n\n[[File:ON ParrySound tango7174.jpg|thumb|230px|Departure point at the harbour, for the sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands]]\n\nParry Sound, and much of Northern Ontario, are well known for their tourism businesses.  Accommodation businesses range from hotels and full service resorts to lodges and camping grounds.  Sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands are offered by Georgian Bay Airways,<ref>[http://www.georgianbayairways.com Georgian Bay Airways]</ref> and the Island Queen and MV Chippawa<ref>[http://www.spiritofthesound.ca M.V.

The town is home to an annual ATV Jamboree<ref>[http://www.springjam.ca Spring Jam]</ref> and guided ATV tours of the region's wilderness are available throughout the year.<ref>[http://bearclawtours.com Bear Claw Tours]</ref>  There are several [[golf courses]] located in and near Parry Sound; [[ice hockey]], [[fishing]] and [[softball]] are also popular recreational sports in the area.  Famous NHLer [[Bobby Orr]] played minor hockey for the Parry Sound Shamrocks. Aidan Dudas also played for the Shamrocks, and currently plays for the [[Owen Sound Attack]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]], and was selected in the fourth round (113th overall) of the [[2019 NHL Draft]] by the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. The town had a junior team also called the Shamrocks for a short period of time who reached the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] championship finals in 1998 and 1999 before the team folded in 2003.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Parry Sound ON.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Harbour of Parry Sound]]\nParry Sound is located along a highway which currently bears the dual designation of [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]]/[[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]].

In addition, [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' (Toronto \u2013 [[Vancouver]]) [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental]] passenger train serve [[Parry Sound railway station]]s three times a week both east- and westbound. Westbound passenger as well as [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] freight trains are carried over the Seguin River by the [[Parry Sound CPR Trestle]], a visible presence in the centre of town.\n\nThe town is served by the [[Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport]] and the [[List of heliports in Canada#188|Parry Sound Medical Heliport]], as well as numerous small water [[aerodromes]]:\n* [[Parry Sound Harbour Water Aerodrome]] (CPS1)\n* [[Parry Sound/Deep Bay Water Aerodrome]] (CPT6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Derbyshire Island Water Aerodrome]] (CDS6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Frying Pan Island-Sans Souci Water Aerodrome]] (CPS9)\n* [[Parry Sound/Huron Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPS8)\n* [[Parry Sound/St. Waleran Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPD6)\n\nThe Big Sound Marina<ref>[http://www.bigsoundmarina.com Big Sound Marina]</ref> is a 120-serviced slip marina on Georgian Bay for transient vessels up to {{convert|60|ft|m|0}}.\n\n==Climate==\n\nParry Sound has a humid continental climate, with some quite-unusual local variations in cloudiness and precipitation for this climate, resulting from its location on the eastern shore of the large body of water comprising Parry Sound and Lake Huron to its west. Parry Sound's annual temperature regime reflects a cool-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Koppen]] Dfb), with January average temperatures of {{convert|-9.0|C}} and July average temperatures near {{convert|20.2|C}}, and the usual minimal seasonal lag typical of continental climates, i.e. January as the coldest month, July as the warmest.\n\nMuch more unusual (for Dfb climates) is Parry Sound's average annual cycle of precipitation, and cloudiness vs. sunshine. With its location on the eastern side of large bodies of water, where prevailing winds and weather come from the west (typical in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere), Parry Sound experiences an exceptionally strong [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]]. From spring to mid-summer, this means lake waters are cooler than nearby land areas, resulting in diminished intensity of low pressure systems and less precipitation, but alternation of low clouds and fog (resulting from warmer air passing over snow-covered ground, frequent into May most years) with occasional sunshine, especially once the long winter's snow cover has melted (mostly May through July). Parry Sound's average driest month is July; here, thunderstorms are rare, due to cool lake waters inhibiting the combination of heat and humidity that fuels thunderstorm activity over areas like the central, southern and eastern United States.\n\nFrom September to January in Parry Sound the lake effect reverses its stabilizing effect from spring into mid-summer, becoming destabilizing. During these months, nearby waters release their stored warmth from the summer season, and increasingly strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pass over these still-relatively-warm waters before hitting Parry Sound. This results in heavy [[cumulus cloud]] formation, instability rain showers (in September and October), transitioning toward heavy snow showers and squalls as temperatures continue to drop from November to January. Parry Sound's average monthly precipitation exceeds {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} inches every month from September to January - but this pattern peaks in December, the year's average wettest month, which averages over {{convert|137|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation, mostly carried by that month's average of {{convert|101.6|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, followed by January's snowfall average of {{convert|91.2|cm|abbr=on}}. Such heavy winter-month precipitation and snowfall figures are virtually nonexistent in humid continental climates, which tend to exist away from large bodies of water. As winter transitions toward spring, snowfall drops sharply by March, when lake and land temperatures nearly equalize. In winter, the heavy lake-effect snowfall is augmented by snowfall from sometimes-strong low-pressure systems (mid-latitude [[cyclone]]s) that often converge on the [[Great Lakes]] and areas further east.\n\nOverall, Parry Sound experiences a typical humid continental, cool-summer climate type in terms of temperatures - but a highly unusual climate regime in precipitation and cloudiness; the year's driest months are generally from March through July, while its wettest months are from September to January, with autumnal lake effect producing cloudy skies and heavy rainfall from September into November, followed by extremely heavy snowfall in December and January.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Parry Sound was {{convert|37.8|C}} on July 6, 1921.

Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early detection from [[fire tower]]s. The headquarters for the district were housed in town. It was the central location for 18 [[fire tower]] lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. In the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial fire fighting techniques were employed. Fire suppression is of enhanced concern in and near Parry Sound due to this area's strong tendency toward drier weather coinciding with the period of highest sun, in June and July. In drier-summer years, drought can be a significant concern here, and with it, heightened wildfire risk.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Radio===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!Call sign\n!Branding\n!Format\n!Owner\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 88.9\n|[[CBPO-FM]]\n|[[Weatheradio Canada]] \n|[[Weather radio]]\n|[[Meteorological Service of Canada]]\n|\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 89.9\n|[[CBLA-FM|CBLR-FM]]\n|[[CBC Radio One]]\n|[[Talk radio]], [[Public broadcasting|public radio]]\n|[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CBLA-FM]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.3\n|[[CHRZ-FM]]\n|Rez 91\n|[[First Nations]] [[community radio]]\n|Wasauksing Communications Group\n|Broadcasts in English and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 103.3\n|[[CKLP-FM]]\n|Moose FM\n|[[Adult hits]]\n|[[Vista Broadcast Group]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Television===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n![[Terrestrial television|OTA]] channel\n!Call sign\n!Network\n!Notes\n|-\n|7 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CIII-DT|CIII-DT-7]]\n|[[Global Television Network|Global]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CIII-DT]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|12 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CKVR-DT|CKVR-TV-1]]\n|[[CTV Two]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CKVR-DT]] ([[Barrie]])\n|-\n|23 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n|[[CHCH-DT|CHCH-DT-3]]\n|''Independent''\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CHCH-DT]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]])\n|}\n\n===Newspapers===\n* North Star - [http://www.parrysound.com The Parry Sound North Star]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1871|1052\n|1901|2884\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3429\n|1921|3546\n|1931|3512\n|1941|5765\n|1951|5183\n|1961|6004\n|1971|5842\n|1981|6124\n|1991|6125\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|6326\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|6124\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5818\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|6191\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|6408\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Canada 2006 Census!!

Parry Sound is located {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and {{convert|225|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Toronto]]. It is a single tier government located in the territorial District of Parry Sound which has no second tier County, Regional or District level of government. Parry Sound is a popular [[cottage|cottage country]] region for [[Southern Ontario]] residents. It also has the world's deepest natural freshwater port.<ref name=\"Society2007\">{{cite book|title=Canadian Geographic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knUZAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2012|volume=127|year=2007|publisher=Royal Canadian Geographical Society|page=82|quote= Parry Sound, the world's deepest freshwater port, lends some measure to what I mean by Ontario Lake Country}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, the area was a popular subject for the many scenic art works of [[Tom Thomson]] and members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. There was a slight decline in economic activity shortly after World War I with [[J.R. Booth]]'s construction of a rival town, [[Depot Harbour, Ontario|Depot Harbour]] on nearby [[Parry Island, Ontario|Parry Island]], but this setback was overcome through later developments in tourism and commerce, and the accidental destruction by fire of the entire town of Depot Harbour on August 14, 1945.\n\nThe body of water that gives the town its name was surveyed and named by Captain [[Henry Bayfield]] in the 19th century, in honour of the Arctic explorer Sir [[William Edward Parry]]. In 1857, the modern townsite was established near the [[Ojibwa]] village of [[Wasauksing First Nation|Wasauksing]] (\"shining shore\") at the mouth of the [[Seguin River]]. Parry Sound was incorporated as a town in 1887.  In the late 19th century, [[railway|rail]] service was established, making the town an important depot along the rail lines to [[Western Canada]].\n\nIn 1916, a [[cordite]] factory was established in the nearby town of [[Nobel, Ontario|Nobel]] for the [[Imperial Munitions Board]]. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an [[explosives]] and [[munitions]] factory was also built at Nobel, making Parry Sound an important part of both the First World War and the Second World War effort.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:downtownParrySound.jpg|thumb|left|View of downtown Parry Sound near the intersection of Seguin and James Streets. A portion of the Sound and the CP railway trestle can be seen in the distance.]]\nParry Sound is the birthplace of hockey legend [[Bobby Orr]], the namesake of the local community centre and the town's own [[Bobby Orr Hall of Fame]]. In Orr's best-selling autobiography, ''[[Orr: My Story (book)|Orr: My Story]]'', he speaks highly of Parry Sound, the friends and family who resided there and the happy childhood he had living in that part of Canada.<ref>Orr, Bobby (2013) ''Bobby Orr: My Story''.

Former Ontario premier [[Ernie Eves]] also called the town home for many years; he was the [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] for the [[Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka (provincial electoral district)|Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka]] riding from 1981 through 2001.\n\nThe town is home to several cultural festivals, including the [[Festival of the Sound]] classical music festival, an annual [[dragonboat]] race and a [[buskers]]' festival which takes place as part of the town's [[Canada Day]] festivities. The [[Charles W. Stockey Centre for the Performing Arts]] serves as the principal performance venue during the Festival of the Sound, and also hosts concerts, live theatre and other cultural events throughout the year.\n\n==Recreation and sports==\nThere are several [[provincial park]]s in the Parry Sound area, including [[Oastler Lake Provincial Park|Oastler Lake]], [[The Massasauga Provincial Park|The Massasauga]] and [[Killbear Provincial Park|Killbear]], as well as numerous provincial [[Nature Reserve Park (Ontario)|conservation reserve]]s, including the Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve, one of only 13 UNESCO sites in Canada. The eastern coast of Georgian Bay where Parry Sound is located is known as the \"30,000 Islands\" and is considered the world's largest freshwater archipelago.  It covers 347,000 hectares of shoreline ecosystem, and over 100 species of animals and plants that are at risk in Canada and Ontario, including unique reptiles and amphibians.  Parry Sound's Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary<ref>[http://www.aspenvalleywildlifesanctuary.com Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary]</ref> cares for injured and orphaned animals, and offers an informational and interpretive centre for wildlife education.  A 230-kilometre recreational trail, the Park-to-Park Trail, connects Killbear with [[Algonquin Provincial Park]] in two locations, to the south at [[Dwight, Ontario|Dwight]], and farther north, east of [[Kearney, Ontario|Kearney]].<ref>[http://www.parktoparktrail.com/ The Park-to-Park Trail]</ref>\n\n[[File:ON ParrySound tango7174.jpg|thumb|230px|Departure point at the harbour, for the sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands]]\n\nParry Sound, and much of Northern Ontario, are well known for their tourism businesses.  Accommodation businesses range from hotels and full service resorts to lodges and camping grounds.  Sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands are offered by Georgian Bay Airways,<ref>[http://www.georgianbayairways.com Georgian Bay Airways]</ref> and the Island Queen and MV Chippawa<ref>[http://www.spiritofthesound.ca M.V.

The town is home to an annual ATV Jamboree<ref>[http://www.springjam.ca Spring Jam]</ref> and guided ATV tours of the region's wilderness are available throughout the year.<ref>[http://bearclawtours.com Bear Claw Tours]</ref>  There are several [[golf courses]] located in and near Parry Sound; [[ice hockey]], [[fishing]] and [[softball]] are also popular recreational sports in the area.  Famous NHLer [[Bobby Orr]] played minor hockey for the Parry Sound Shamrocks. Aidan Dudas also played for the Shamrocks, and currently plays for the [[Owen Sound Attack]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]], and was selected in the fourth round (113th overall) of the [[2019 NHL Draft]] by the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. The town had a junior team also called the Shamrocks for a short period of time who reached the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] championship finals in 1998 and 1999 before the team folded in 2003.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Parry Sound ON.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Harbour of Parry Sound]]\nParry Sound is located along a highway which currently bears the dual designation of [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]]/[[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]].

In addition, [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' (Toronto \u2013 [[Vancouver]]) [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental]] passenger train serve [[Parry Sound railway station]]s three times a week both east- and westbound. Westbound passenger as well as [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] freight trains are carried over the Seguin River by the [[Parry Sound CPR Trestle]], a visible presence in the centre of town.\n\nThe town is served by the [[Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport]] and the [[List of heliports in Canada#188|Parry Sound Medical Heliport]], as well as numerous small water [[aerodromes]]:\n* [[Parry Sound Harbour Water Aerodrome]] (CPS1)\n* [[Parry Sound/Deep Bay Water Aerodrome]] (CPT6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Derbyshire Island Water Aerodrome]] (CDS6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Frying Pan Island-Sans Souci Water Aerodrome]] (CPS9)\n* [[Parry Sound/Huron Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPS8)\n* [[Parry Sound/St. Waleran Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPD6)\n\nThe Big Sound Marina<ref>[http://www.bigsoundmarina.com Big Sound Marina]</ref> is a 120-serviced slip marina on Georgian Bay for transient vessels up to {{convert|60|ft|m|0}}.\n\n==Climate==\n\nParry Sound has a humid continental climate, with some quite-unusual local variations in cloudiness and precipitation for this climate, resulting from its location on the eastern shore of the large body of water comprising Parry Sound and Lake Huron to its west. Parry Sound's annual temperature regime reflects a cool-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Koppen]] Dfb), with January average temperatures of {{convert|-9.0|C}} and July average temperatures near {{convert|20.2|C}}, and the usual minimal seasonal lag typical of continental climates, i.e. January as the coldest month, July as the warmest.\n\nMuch more unusual (for Dfb climates) is Parry Sound's average annual cycle of precipitation, and cloudiness vs. sunshine. With its location on the eastern side of large bodies of water, where prevailing winds and weather come from the west (typical in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere), Parry Sound experiences an exceptionally strong [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]]. From spring to mid-summer, this means lake waters are cooler than nearby land areas, resulting in diminished intensity of low pressure systems and less precipitation, but alternation of low clouds and fog (resulting from warmer air passing over snow-covered ground, frequent into May most years) with occasional sunshine, especially once the long winter's snow cover has melted (mostly May through July). Parry Sound's average driest month is July; here, thunderstorms are rare, due to cool lake waters inhibiting the combination of heat and humidity that fuels thunderstorm activity over areas like the central, southern and eastern United States.\n\nFrom September to January in Parry Sound the lake effect reverses its stabilizing effect from spring into mid-summer, becoming destabilizing. During these months, nearby waters release their stored warmth from the summer season, and increasingly strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pass over these still-relatively-warm waters before hitting Parry Sound. This results in heavy [[cumulus cloud]] formation, instability rain showers (in September and October), transitioning toward heavy snow showers and squalls as temperatures continue to drop from November to January. Parry Sound's average monthly precipitation exceeds {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} inches every month from September to January - but this pattern peaks in December, the year's average wettest month, which averages over {{convert|137|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation, mostly carried by that month's average of {{convert|101.6|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, followed by January's snowfall average of {{convert|91.2|cm|abbr=on}}. Such heavy winter-month precipitation and snowfall figures are virtually nonexistent in humid continental climates, which tend to exist away from large bodies of water. As winter transitions toward spring, snowfall drops sharply by March, when lake and land temperatures nearly equalize. In winter, the heavy lake-effect snowfall is augmented by snowfall from sometimes-strong low-pressure systems (mid-latitude [[cyclone]]s) that often converge on the [[Great Lakes]] and areas further east.\n\nOverall, Parry Sound experiences a typical humid continental, cool-summer climate type in terms of temperatures - but a highly unusual climate regime in precipitation and cloudiness; the year's driest months are generally from March through July, while its wettest months are from September to January, with autumnal lake effect producing cloudy skies and heavy rainfall from September into November, followed by extremely heavy snowfall in December and January.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Parry Sound was {{convert|37.8|C}} on July 6, 1921.

Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early detection from [[fire tower]]s. The headquarters for the district were housed in town. It was the central location for 18 [[fire tower]] lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. In the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial fire fighting techniques were employed. Fire suppression is of enhanced concern in and near Parry Sound due to this area's strong tendency toward drier weather coinciding with the period of highest sun, in June and July. In drier-summer years, drought can be a significant concern here, and with it, heightened wildfire risk.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Radio===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!Call sign\n!Branding\n!Format\n!Owner\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 88.9\n|[[CBPO-FM]]\n|[[Weatheradio Canada]] \n|[[Weather radio]]\n|[[Meteorological Service of Canada]]\n|\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 89.9\n|[[CBLA-FM|CBLR-FM]]\n|[[CBC Radio One]]\n|[[Talk radio]], [[Public broadcasting|public radio]]\n|[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CBLA-FM]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.3\n|[[CHRZ-FM]]\n|Rez 91\n|[[First Nations]] [[community radio]]\n|Wasauksing Communications Group\n|Broadcasts in English and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 103.3\n|[[CKLP-FM]]\n|Moose FM\n|[[Adult hits]]\n|[[Vista Broadcast Group]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Television===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n![[Terrestrial television|OTA]] channel\n!Call sign\n!Network\n!Notes\n|-\n|7 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CIII-DT|CIII-DT-7]]\n|[[Global Television Network|Global]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CIII-DT]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|12 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CKVR-DT|CKVR-TV-1]]\n|[[CTV Two]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CKVR-DT]] ([[Barrie]])\n|-\n|23 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n|[[CHCH-DT|CHCH-DT-3]]\n|''Independent''\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CHCH-DT]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]])\n|}\n\n===Newspapers===\n* North Star - [http://www.parrysound.com The Parry Sound North Star]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1871|1052\n|1901|2884\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3429\n|1921|3546\n|1931|3512\n|1941|5765\n|1951|5183\n|1961|6004\n|1971|5842\n|1981|6124\n|1991|6125\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|6326\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|6124\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5818\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|6191\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|6408\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Canada 2006 Census!!

Other names for the breed include '''Ainu-ken''', '''Seta''', '''Ainu dog'''. In Japan, its name is sometimes shortened to '''''D\u014d-ken''''' (\u9053\u72ac). The Hokkaido is native to the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of the [[Hokkaid\u014d|same name]] in [[Japan]].\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Hokkaido 01.jpg|thumb|233px|left|A pair of Hokkaido dogs]]\nThe breed is medium in size, with small, triangular, upright ears. The small eyes have a rising triangular outline. The Hokkaido has a [[coat (dog)|coat]] of long, stiff fur, and a second, shorter coat of soft fur. Colors include red, white, black, brindle, sesame, black and tan, and wolf-gray. Males are typically 50 cm (20 in) tall at the [[withers]], females slightly shorter, with body masses in the 20 kg (44 lb) range. Dogs bred on continents outside of their native Japan may be smaller. The Hokkaido dog breed doesn't shed much year-round. In the shedding season (spring and fall), they change their whole undercoat and the shedding is somewhat more substantial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worlddogfinder.com/blog/news/the-hokkaido|title=The Hokkaido|website=www.worlddogfinder.com}}</ref>\n\n==Temperament==\nThe breed is known for [[fidelity]] to its owner, bravery, and the ability to withstand the cold, among other traits. It has an innate sense of direction and smell, and can therefore return to its master no matter how great the distance. Temperament will vary depending on the lineage and region of upbringing. \n\nTraditionally in Japan, the dog has been used as a working breed that plays both the role of family pet and hunter. In Japan, they are strongly tied to hunting kennels and work alongside their handlers to manage populations of wild boar and bear. Their vocal nature manifests in varying types of characteristic howls, long and short barks, used as sighting signals on hunts. They have an unusual fighting style against the [[Ussuri brown bear|Hokkaido brown bear]], or ''higuma'', and will take risks to protect its master, despite size differences. The way in which the Ainu dog accomplishes this is to attack the bear's back, then bite and hold the dorsal flesh of the bear's neck until the bear retreats. For this purpose, the Hokkaido in Japan are encouraged to have a fierce and unrelenting character that benefits in the field.\n\nBrought up as a family pet, Hokkaido may deviate from the more primal temperament exhibited with dogs in hunting kennels. The Hokkaido is highly intelligent and food motivated, a combination that results in positive responses to training. Hunting dogs are encouraged to be vocal, but a Hokkaido as a family pet may not necessarily exhibit such habits with training. As the Hokkaido has very little distribution throughout countries outside Japan, the Hokkaido's temperament solely as a family pet is still forming. Although the Hokkaido carries an innate prey drive, early socialization shows good behaviors with cats and other small animals considered to be part of its 'pack'.\n\nThe Hokkaido's play is different from other breeds, with a more crouch and prowl style of play that is often misunderstood as aggression. For this reason, Hokkaido are often considered to be leash only animals. However, with its roots to hunting, they have excellent owner stickiness and work well with recall techniques.\n\nThey are good with children and other animals if they are raised with them from puppyhood and/or properly socialized. The Hokkaido needs moderate but regular exercise to stay in shape.

Other names for the breed include '''Ainu-ken''', '''Seta''', '''Ainu dog'''. In Japan, its name is sometimes shortened to '''''D\u014d-ken''''' (\u9053\u72ac). The Hokkaido is native to the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of the [[Hokkaid\u014d|same name]] in [[Japan]].\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Hokkaido 01.jpg|thumb|233px|left|A pair of Hokkaido dogs]]\nThe breed is medium in size, with small, triangular, upright ears. The small eyes have a rising triangular outline. The Hokkaido has a [[coat (dog)|coat]] of long, stiff fur, and a second, shorter coat of soft fur. Colors include red, white, black, brindle, sesame, black and tan, and wolf-gray. Males are typically 50 cm (20 in) tall at the [[withers]], females slightly shorter, with body masses in the 20 kg (44 lb) range. Dogs bred on continents outside of their native Japan may be smaller.\n\n==Temperament==\nThe breed is known for [[fidelity]] to its owner, bravery, and the ability to withstand the cold, among other traits. It has an innate sense of direction and smell, and can therefore return to its master no matter how great the distance. Temperament will vary depending on the lineage and region of upbringing. \n\nTraditionally in Japan, the dog has been used as a working breed that plays both the role of family pet and hunter. In Japan, they are strongly tied to hunting kennels and work alongside their handlers to manage populations of wild boar and bear. Their vocal nature manifests in varying types of characteristic howls, long and short barks, used as sighting signals on hunts. They have an unusual fighting style against the [[Ussuri brown bear|Hokkaido brown bear]], or ''higuma'', and will take risks to protect its master, despite size differences. The way in which the Ainu dog accomplishes this is to attack the bear's back, then bite and hold the dorsal flesh of the bear's neck until the bear retreats. For this purpose, the Hokkaido in Japan are encouraged to have a fierce and unrelenting character that benefits in the field.\n\nBrought up as a family pet, Hokkaido may deviate from the more primal temperament exhibited with dogs in hunting kennels. The Hokkaido is highly intelligent and food motivated, a combination that results in positive responses to training. Hunting dogs are encouraged to be vocal, but a Hokkaido as a family pet may not necessarily exhibit such habits with training. As the Hokkaido has very little distribution throughout countries outside Japan, the Hokkaido's temperament solely as a family pet is still forming. Although the Hokkaido carries an innate prey drive, early socialization shows good behaviors with cats and other small animals considered to be part of its 'pack'.\n\nThe Hokkaido's play is different from other breeds, with a more crouch and prowl style of play that is often misunderstood as aggression. For this reason, Hokkaido are often considered to be leash only animals. However, with its roots to hunting, they have excellent owner stickiness and work well with recall techniques.\n\nThey are good with children and other animals if they are raised with them from puppyhood and/or properly socialized. The Hokkaido needs moderate but regular exercise to stay in shape. It should be taken for long daily walks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/ainudog.htm|title=Ainu Dog Breed Information and Pictures|website=www.dogbreedinfo.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Hokkaido dog is thought to have originated from the medium-sized dogs brought by immigrants from the main island of [[Honshu]] in the 1140s.<ref>[http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/261g05-en.pdf FCI Breed Standard ]</ref> In 1869, the English zoologist Thomas W.
