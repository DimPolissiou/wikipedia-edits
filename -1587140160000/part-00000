It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end. The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors. The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\" /> The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list.<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ | accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nIn the [[New York County Courthouse]], a [[judge]] instructs a [[jury]] about to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old youth from a [[slum]] on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]].<ref>http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF</ref> The jury is further instructed that the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe evidence seems convincing, with testimony from the neighbor across the street who said she witnessed the defendant stab his father from her window. Further, the elderly neighbor in the apartment below testified that he heard the defendant shout at his father that he would kill him, and then, through his door's peephole, saw him run past his door.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who reasons that there should be some discussion about the case before quickly reaching a \"guilty\" verdict and also brings up the defendant's rough upbringing. He questions the reliability of the two witnesses and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a switchblade, was \"rare\" and produces an identical knife. Juror 8 argues that he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists.\n\nHaving [[Hung jury|hung the jury]], Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot among the other eleven; if all the remaining jurors still vote \"guilty\", he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy, but Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be some more discussion.\n\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat that one witness claimed to have heard the defendant tell his father: \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, having returned to the apartment and been met by the police, was not trying to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it.\n\nJurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's ability to have made it to his door in time to see the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor. Juror 3 is infuriated, and Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] public avenger. Juror 3 tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\", and Juror 8 calmly replies, \"You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?\" proving his previous point. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the verdict 6\u20136 as a [[thunderstorm]] begins.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details, and Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous seven days though with some difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the defendant, being seven inches shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound. Jurors 3 and 8 act this out which confirms the possibility. However, Juror 5 demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, proving that someone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would have been, would always stab underhand at an upwards angle against a taller opponent.\n\nImpatient to leave due to having tickets to that night's baseball game, Juror 7 changes his vote and earns the ire of other jurors, and is confronted by juror 11; he insists that he thinks the defendant is not guilty but doesn't explain why. Jurors 1 and 12 then change their votes, leaving only Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 erupts in vitriol against slum people. One by one, the rest of the jurors, except 7 and 4, turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to \"sit down and don't open your mouth again\". Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts his vote, making the vote 8\u20134.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, suggesting that she wears glasses but did not wear them in court. Other jurors confirm the same, and Juror 8 adds that she would not have worn them to bed, and the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3.\n\nJuror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son, the reason he wants the accused to be guilty. He tears up a photograph of him and his son and almost immediately breaks down sobbing and mutters \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. As the rest leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The defendant is found \"not guilty\" off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue on the courthouse steps, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names (Davis and McCardle respectively) before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|isbn=978-0-7679-1634-9}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]].

She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.<ref>{{Citation| last = Semple | first = Kirk| title = The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice| newspaper = The New York Times| date = October 18, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html| accessdate =October 18, 2010}}</ref> Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nThere have been a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last = Lyons | first = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last = Homes | first = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> BBC Radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|Twelve Angry Men]]''. ''[[The Flintstones]]'' story \"Disorder in the Court\" and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' story \"[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (The Simpsons)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]\" similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. ''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]\", and ''[[King of The Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3. Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title=\"Happy Days\" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}</ref> ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater. The American TV situation comedy, [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|''The Odd Couple'']], starring Jack Klugman (Juror 5 in the movie), satirizes the film in \"The Jury Story\".

It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end. The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors. The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\" /> The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list.<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ | accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nIn the [[New York County Courthouse]], a [[judge]] instructs a [[jury]] about to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old youth from a [[slum]] on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]].<ref>http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF</ref> The jury is further instructed that the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe evidence seems convincing, with testimony from the neighbor across the street who said she witnessed the defendant stab his father from her window. Further, the elderly neighbor in the apartment below testified that he heard the defendant shout at his father that he would kill him, and then, through his door's peephole, saw him run past his door.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who reasons that there should be some discussion about the case before quickly reaching a \"guilty\" verdict and also brings up the defendant's rough upbringing. He questions the reliability of the two witnesses and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a switchblade, was \"rare\" and produces an identical knife. Juror 8 argues that he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists.\n\nHaving [[Hung jury|hung the jury]], Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot among the other eleven; if all the remaining jurors still vote \"guilty\", he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy, but Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be some more discussion.\n\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat that one witness claimed to have heard the defendant tell his father: \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, having returned to the apartment and been met by the police, was not trying to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it.\n\nJurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's ability to have made it to his door in time to see the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor. Juror 3 is infuriated, and Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] public avenger. Juror 3 tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\", and Juror 8 calmly replies, \"You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?\" proving his previous point. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the verdict 6\u20136 as a [[thunderstorm]] begins.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details, and Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous seven days though with some difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the defendant, being seven inches shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound. Jurors 3 and 8 act this out which confirms the possibility. However, Juror 5 demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, proving that someone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would have been, would always stab underhand at an upwards angle against a taller opponent.\n\nImpatient to leave due to having tickets to that night's baseball game, Juror 7 changes his vote and earns the ire of other jurors, and is confronted by juror 11; he insists that he thinks the defendant is not guilty but doesn't explain why. Jurors 1 and 12 then change their votes, leaving only Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 erupts in vitriol against slum people. One by one, the rest of the jurors, except 7 and 4, turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to \"sit down and don't open your mouth again\". Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts his vote, making the vote 8\u20134.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, suggesting that she wears glasses but did not wear them in court. Other jurors confirm the same, and Juror 8 adds that she would not have worn them to bed, and the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3.\n\nJuror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son, the reason he wants the accused to be guilty. He tears up a photograph of him and his son and almost immediately breaks down sobbing and mutters \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. As the rest leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The defendant is found \"not guilty\" off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue on the courthouse steps, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names (Davis and McCardle respectively) before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|isbn=978-0-7679-1634-9}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of Twelve Angry Men|website=Playhouse Square |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Initial response ===\nOn its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim.

She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.<ref>{{Citation| last = Semple | first = Kirk| title = The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice| newspaper = The New York Times| date = October 18, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html| accessdate =October 18, 2010}}</ref> Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nThere have been a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last = Lyons | first = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last = Homes | first = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> BBC Radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|Twelve Angry Men]]''. ''[[The Flintstones]]'' story \"Disorder in the Court\" and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' story \"[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (The Simpsons)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]\" similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. ''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]\", and ''[[King of The Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3. Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title=\"Happy Days\" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}</ref> ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater. The American TV situation comedy, [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|''The Odd Couple'']], starring Jack Klugman (Juror 5 in the movie), satirizes the film in \"The Jury Story\".
