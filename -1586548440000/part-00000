The couple lived in Lithgow until 1956, when they moved first to Fennells Bay and then to [[Teralba, New South Wales|Teralba]], on the shore of Lake Macquarie, where Fred had work. In 1966, Fred's work there was complete and the couple returned to Lithgow, where they remained until Fred's death. Subsequently, Sally moved to [[Albury]] to stay with a niece, Jean, but unfortunately died following a tragic caravan fire on the property in which she was badly burned,<ref name = \"Low\" /> at the age of 87.\n\n==Musical activities, repertoire and style==\nSally's mother Sarah was musical, playing concertina, button accordion, jew's harp and piano, and sang many songs from the repertoire of her own mother. Sally inherited her mother's love of music, playing the instruments favoured by her mother as well as becoming an accomplished player on the fiddle, mouth organ and tin whistle. While still a youngster she was already playing for bush dances and sang at local gatherings. Sally also mentioned (in an interview with Warren Fahey) appearing on stage at the [[New Tivoli Theatre, Sydney|Tivoli Theatre]] in Sydney on at least one occasion during the [[second world war]], playing for soldiers.<ref>National Library of Australia: [https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34540525?q&versionId=42748085 Sally Sloane interviewed by Warren Fahey in the Warren Fahey collection], 1976.</ref>\n\nIn early 1955, John Meredith was performing in Lithgow with his pioneering \"bush band\" [[The Bushwhackers (band)|The Bushwhackers]] and as was his usual practice on the hunt for \"bush singers\", enquired whether there were any local singers he could visit. Fred Sloane was one of the organisers for the concert and told Meredith that his wife had a huge store of songs and tunes and could sing them \"until the cows come home\"; Meredith at first was inclined to disbelieve this but another of the group, Alan Scott was billeted with the Sloanes that weekend and confirmed the truth of Fred's assertion. Meredith lost no time in paying the Sloanes a visit on the next available occasion and returned numerous times, eventually recording over 150 items from her repertoire.<ref name=\"McKenry\">McKenry, Keith: ''More Than a Life: John Meredith and the Fight for Australian Tradition.'' Rosenberg Publishing, 2014. {{ISBN|9781925078145}}</ref> A number of these were later released on the 1983 Larrikin Records LP, \"A Garland For Sally\". Meredith and the Sloanes enjoyed a close friendship, with Sally frequently contacting Meredith to tell him that she had remembered another song, or fragment thereof, with the result that Meredith visited the Sloanes on no less than 60 occasions; at one stage he was making the journey up to Lithgow (and later Teralba) every second month.<ref>McKenry, Keith: \"Obituary: John Meredith, AM\". Available at http://folkstream.com/reviews/revival/merobit.html</ref>\n\nMeredith included Sally (as \"Mrs. F. Sloane\") as one of the \"true Australian tradition-bearers\" at the inaugural Australian Folklore Festival, staged in Sydney in September 1955. She was also (re-) recorded performing 8 items (songs and tunes) for a 1957 Wattle Records release ''Australian Traditional Singers and Musicians'', along with other musicians originally recorded by Meredith including Duke Tritton, Herbert Gimbert and Edwin Goodwin - only the last using Meredith's original recording, since the singer had subsequently died. Reviewing this release in ''Midwest Folklore'' in 1959, the eminent U.S. folklorist [[Kenneth S. Goldstein]] wrote: \"Mrs. Sloan[e] is one of the great traditional singers of the world, certainly comparing favorably with the best to be offered in the English-speaking nations. And Mrs. Sloane's renditions on the button accordion and mouth organ are as delightful as her singing.\"<ref>Goldstein, Kenneth S. (1959): \"Folklore on Records\". ''Midwest Folklore'', Vol. 9, No. 1 (Spring, 1959), pp. 55-60.</ref>\n\nSally was visited over the years by several other collectors including Warren Fahey and Graham Seal, Emily Lyle and Chris Sullivan, from the 1950s until the late 1970s. Former Bushwhacker and mouth organ player Harry Kay noted two Schottisches from her on a visit to him in Sydney in around 1968<ref>Mulga Wire no.82, Dec 1990, pp.S1-S4; reproduced at https://blog.bushmusic.org.au/2020/04/from-archives-fine-pair-of-schottisches.html</ref>, while recordings made by Warren Fahey in 1976 are held in the National Library of Australia's Oral History and Folklore Collection.<ref name = \"Fahey\">[http://www.warrenfahey.com.au/sally-sloane/ Warren Fahey's Australian Folklore Unit: \"Sally Sloane\".]</ref><ref name = \"trove_1\">[https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/158894835?q&c=article&versionId=173203121 Sally Sloane: 'queen of singing folk' (Warren Fahey's 1976 field recordings held in the National Library of Australia's Oral History and Folklore Collection.)]</ref>\n\nSally's performance style and repertoire, strongly influenced by the songs she learned orally, passed down by her Irish grandmother and mother, included original Irish ballads, English and Scottish traditional songs, bush ballads, and popular songs from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that she learned from other musicians.<ref name = \"Gall\" /> Her Australian repertoire included such songs as \"The Springtime it Brings on the Shearing\", \"The Wallaby Track\", Henry Lawson's \"Ballad of the Drover\", \"Click Go the Shears\", and bushranger songs such as \"The Death of Ben Hall\" and \"John Doolin\", her version of \"The Wild Colonial Boy\";<ref name = \"Smith\">Smith, Graeme (2015). \"Australian Folk Song: Sources, Singers and Styles.\" ''Musicology Australia'', 37(2): 218\u2013233</ref> it was songs like these (and bush instrumentals) that first attracted Meredith to Sally as an informant, however the survival of unique versions of Irish and British songs from the mid nineteenth century repertoire of her Irish grandmother can be viewed as equally if not more important from a folkloristic perspective.\n\nGraeme Smith described her singing style in the following manner:\n\n<blockquote>\"Distinctive and elegant as her melodies are, Sloane's singing style is the basis of her artistry. Her vocal production occasionally showed some use of a theatrical projection and vibrato, but in the main she used a steady pitch and a relatively direct narrative approach typical of vernacular traditional style. Within this vocal production she deployed a range of subtle vocal ornaments to emphasize both individual words and melodic points. Her most used ornament is an emphatic upper grace note, executed with a vocal break, often on an accented beat, but also deployed to hold the drama of other individual pitches, particularly in songs delivered at a slower tact, for example in 'The Springtime it Brings on the Shearing'. She uses portamento sparingly but nonetheless effectively.\"<ref name=\"Smith\" /></blockquote>\n\nJohn Meredith, in his introduction to \"The Sally Sloane Songbook\" (see below), wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Rather amazingly Sally Sloane had two singing voices, which might conveniently be termed 'folk' and 'stage'. The first was used for all those lovely old Irish ballads Sal had inherited from her grandmother, through the medium of her mother, and this was a hard, clear, unemotional voice and style, very much in the Irish tradition. The other voice was reserved for those stage and art songs of probable music hall origins. It was a rich mezzo-soprano with a little vibrato and she used it for such songs as The Deep Shades of Blue, to give one example.\"</blockquote>\n\nA selection from Sally's repertoire was published posthumously as \"The Sally Sloane Songbook\" (Scott, 2004; for details see Bibliography). A listing of c. 144 items (songs and tunes) collected by John Meredith from Sally is given as an \"extra\" to the account of her life prepared by Valda Low,<ref name = \"Low\" /> a more detailed list (with links) of tunes only was prepared by Ian Hayden in 2016,<ref>Hayden, Ian: [https://sallysloane.wordpress.com/ The music of Sally Sloane]</ref> while Warren Fahey has put online a separate list of items of Sally's that he recorded.<ref name = \"Fahey\" />\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Meredith, John & Anderson, Hugh (1967).

Subsequently, Sally moved to [[Albury]] to stay with a niece, Jean, but unfortunately died following a tragic fire on the property, having been badly burned,<ref name = \"Low\" /> at the age of 87.\n\n==Musical activities, repertoire and style==\nSally's mother Sarah was musical, playing concertina, button accordion, jew's harp and piano, and sang many songs from the repertoire of her own mother. Sally inherited her mother's love of music, playing the instruments favoured by her mother as well as becoming an accomplished player on the fiddle, mouth organ and tin whistle. While still a youngster she was already playing for bush dances and sang at local gatherings. Sally also mentioned (in an interview with Warren Fahey) appearing on stage at the [[New Tivoli Theatre, Sydney|Tivoli Theatre]] in Sydney on at least one occasion during the [[second world war]], playing for soldiers.<ref>National Library of Australia: [https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34540525?q&versionId=42748085 Sally Sloane interviewed by Warren Fahey in the Warren Fahey collection], 1976.</ref>\n\nIn early 1955, John Meredith was performing in Lithgow with his pioneering \"bush band\" [[The Bushwhackers (band)|The Bushwhackers]] and as was his usual practice on the hunt for \"bush singers\", enquired whether there were any local singers he could visit. Fred Sloane was one of the organisers for the concert and told Meredith that his wife had a huge store of songs and tunes and could sing them \"until the cows come home\"; Meredith at first was inclined to disbelieve this but another of the group, Alan Scott was billeted with the Sloanes that weekend and confirmed the truth of Fred's assertion. Meredith lost no time in paying the Sloanes a visit on the next available occasion and returned numerous times, eventually recording over 150 items from her repertoire.<ref name=\"McKenry\">McKenry, Keith: ''More Than a Life: John Meredith and the Fight for Australian Tradition.'' Rosenberg Publishing, 2014. {{ISBN|9781925078145}}</ref> A number of these were later released on the 1983 Larrikin Records LP, \"A Garland For Sally\". Meredith and the Sloanes enjoyed a close friendship, with Sally frequently contacting Meredith to tell him that she had remembered another song, or fragment thereof, with the result that Meredith visited the Sloanes on no less than 60 occasions; at one stage he was making the journey up to Lithgow (and later Teralba) every second month.<ref>McKenry, Keith: \"Obituary: John Meredith, AM\". Available at http://folkstream.com/reviews/revival/merobit.html</ref>\n\nMeredith included Sally (as \"Mrs. F. Sloane\") as one of the \"true Australian tradition-bearers\" at the inaugural Australian Folklore Festival, staged in Sydney in September 1955. She was also (re-) recorded performing 8 items (songs and tunes) for a 1957 Wattle Records release ''Australian Traditional Singers and Musicians'', along with other musicians originally recorded by Meredith including Duke Tritton, Herbert Gimbert and Edwin Goodwin - only the last using Meredith's original recording, since the singer had subsequently died. Reviewing this release in ''Midwest Folklore'' in 1959, the eminent U.S. folklorist [[Kenneth S. Goldstein]] wrote: \"Mrs. Sloan[e] is one of the great traditional singers of the world, certainly comparing favorably with the best to be offered in the English-speaking nations. And Mrs. Sloane's renditions on the button accordion and mouth organ are as delightful as her singing.\"<ref>Goldstein, Kenneth S. (1959): \"Folklore on Records\". ''Midwest Folklore'', Vol. 9, No. 1 (Spring, 1959), pp. 55-60.</ref>\n\nSally was visited over the years by several other collectors including Warren Fahey and Graham Seal, Emily Lyle and Chris Sullivan, from the 1950s until the late 1970s. Former Bushwhacker and mouth organ player Harry Kay noted two Schottisches from her on a visit to him in Sydney in around 1968<ref>Mulga Wire no.82, Dec 1990, pp.S1-S4; reproduced at https://blog.bushmusic.org.au/2020/04/from-archives-fine-pair-of-schottisches.html</ref>, while recordings made by Warren Fahey in 1976 are held in the National Library of Australia's Oral History and Folklore Collection.<ref name = \"Fahey\">[http://www.warrenfahey.com.au/sally-sloane/ Warren Fahey's Australian Folklore Unit: \"Sally Sloane\".]</ref><ref name = \"trove_1\">[https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/158894835?q&c=article&versionId=173203121 Sally Sloane: 'queen of singing folk' (Warren Fahey's 1976 field recordings held in the National Library of Australia's Oral History and Folklore Collection.)]</ref>\n\nSally's performance style and repertoire, strongly influenced by the songs she learned orally, passed down by her Irish grandmother and mother, included original Irish ballads, English and Scottish traditional songs, bush ballads, and popular songs from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that she learned from other musicians.<ref name = \"Gall\" /> Her Australian repertoire included such songs as \"The Springtime it Brings on the Shearing\", \"The Wallaby Track\", Henry Lawson's \"Ballad of the Drover\", \"Click Go the Shears\", and bushranger songs such as \"The Death of Ben Hall\" and \"John Doolin\", her version of \"The Wild Colonial Boy\";<ref name = \"Smith\">Smith, Graeme (2015). \"Australian Folk Song: Sources, Singers and Styles.\" ''Musicology Australia'', 37(2): 218\u2013233</ref> it was songs like these (and bush instrumentals) that first attracted Meredith to Sally as an informant, however the survival of unique versions of Irish and British songs from the mid nineteenth century repertoire of her Irish grandmother can be viewed as equally if not more important from a folkloristic perspective.\n\nGraeme Smith described her singing style in the following manner:\n\n<blockquote>\"Distinctive and elegant as her melodies are, Sloane's singing style is the basis of her artistry. Her vocal production occasionally showed some use of a theatrical projection and vibrato, but in the main she used a steady pitch and a relatively direct narrative approach typical of vernacular traditional style. Within this vocal production she deployed a range of subtle vocal ornaments to emphasize both individual words and melodic points. Her most used ornament is an emphatic upper grace note, executed with a vocal break, often on an accented beat, but also deployed to hold the drama of other individual pitches, particularly in songs delivered at a slower tact, for example in 'The Springtime it Brings on the Shearing'. She uses portamento sparingly but nonetheless effectively.\"<ref name=\"Smith\" /></blockquote>\n\nJohn Meredith, in his introduction to \"The Sally Sloane Songbook\" (see below), wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Rather amazingly Sally Sloane had two singing voices, which might conveniently be termed 'folk' and 'stage'. The first was used for all those lovely old Irish ballads Sal had inherited from her grandmother, through the medium of her mother, and this was a hard, clear, unemotional voice and style, very much in the Irish tradition. The other voice was reserved for those stage and art songs of probable music hall origins. It was a rich mezzo-soprano with a little vibrato and she used it for such songs as The Deep Shades of Blue, to give one example.\"</blockquote>\n\nA selection from Sally's repertoire was published posthumously as \"The Sally Sloane Songbook\" (Scott, 2004; for details see Bibliography).

Directional Boring/HDD offers significant environmental advantages over traditional cut and cover pipeline/utility installations. The technique is routinely used when conventional trenching or [[Digging|excavating]] is not practical or when minimal surface disturbance is required.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably, the terms directional boring and horizontal directional drilling are distinct in that they convey a different sense of scale. The term \"Directional Boring\" or \"Bore\" is generally reserved for mini/small sized drilling rigs, small diameter bores, and crossing lengths in terms of hundreds of feet. Generally, the term Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) is intended to describe large/maxi sized drilling rigs, large diameter bores, and crossing lengths in terms of thousands of feet. Directional boring and HDD are similar in some respects to directional drilling associated with the oil industry, however, an equal comparison cannot be drawn as the procedures serve markedly different functions. Directional Boring/HDD can be utilized with various pipe materials such as [[PVC]], [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[ductile iron]], and [[steel]] provided that the pipe's properties (wall thickness and material strength) enable it to be both installed and operated (if applicable) under acceptable stress limits.\n\nDirectional Boring/HDD is generally accomplished in three principal phases. First, a small diameter pilot hole is drilled along a directional path from one surface point to another. Next, the bore created during pilot hole drilling is enlarged to a diameter that will facilitate installation of the desired pipeline. Lastly, the pipeline is pulled into the enlarged hole, thus creating a continuous segment of pipe underground exposed only at the two initial endpoints. Directional Boring/HDD can be utilized to cross any number of surface obstacles including roadways, railroads, wetlands, and water bodies of varying sizes/depths.\n\nThe process is suitable for a variety of soil conditions including clay, silt, sand, and rock. Problematic soil conditions include large grain content in the form of coarse gravel, cobbles, and boulders.<ref>Installation of Pipelines by Horizontal Directional Drilling, An Engineering Design Guide (Arlington, VA: Pipeline Research Council\nInternational, Inc., 2008)</ref> Other subsurface conditions which can impact the feasibility of Directional Boring/HDD include excessive rock strength and abrasivity, poor rock quality, and rock exhibiting [[karst]] features.\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:Small HDD Rig.jpg|thumb|Small HDD Rig]]\n[[File:Drilling Rig 1.jpg|thumb|Maxi Sized Drilling Rig]]\n[[File:Typical Max-Sized HDD Rig Spread.jpg|thumb|Typical Max-Sized HDD Rig Spread (approximately 50,000 sq ft.)]]\nThe equipment used in Directional Boring/HDD depends on the length of the (proposed) crossing, the pipe properties (of the to-be-installed pipeline), and the (anticipated) subsurface conditions.\n\nFor longer more challenging crossings, tractor trailer mounted drills capable of 1,320,000 lbs (thrust/pullback force) and 150,000 ft-lbs (rotary force) may be used [600 [[tonnes]]- 204,000 N-M ]. These units are used in conjunction with a drilling fluid reclaimer, high volume pump or pumps, an excavator (or comparable equipment for managing drill pipe), along with an assortment of other ancillary equipment (e.g. water tanks, spoil containers, and etc.) to facilitate typical operations.\n\nFor smaller bores, proportionally smaller and more portable equipment is available. These units may be capable of anywhere from 5,000 lbs to 100,000 lbs of thrust/push force and may be used for spanning between a house basement to a nearby shared water pipe. Fluid exhaustion associated with smaller bores is proportionally less as well. In many instances, smaller bores do not require the use of drilling fluid, only water, and in even less significant bores no fluids at all. <ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tu.no/artikler/kandidat-4-hawle-techni-og-basum-gravefri-tilkobling-av-hus-til-hovedvannledning/409344 |title=Fant ny l\u00f8sning som gir gravefri tilkobling av hus til hovedvannledning |publisher=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=18 October 2017 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTooling, as in the mechanical apparatus that are installed to the drill string to conduct operations, are available in a wide number of different shapes and sizes. Directional Boring/HDD tooling includes the suite of drill bits or drill heads used during pilot hole operations, reamers and hole-openers used for hole enlargement, and swab tools which are used for hole conditioning and pullback. Tooling intended to navigate rock, or tougher formations, may use tungsten carbide alloys or Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD). In contrast, tooling intended to navigate soft soils may be limited to high carbon steel (milled to a desired shape and size). The methodology of advancement also varies somewhat between soil and rock crossings. Advancement of tooling within loose uncemented soils is largely accomplished by hydraulic excavation. That is, the soil is being cut and or removed under the influence of high pressure fluid. Within rock formations, hydraulic excavation is still taking place to some degree (evacuating spoil) but the lion's share of cutting and breaking up material is due to mechanical work being done by the tool itself.\n\n==Technique==\n\nDirectional boring is used for installing [[infrastructure]] such as [[telecommunications|telecom]] and power cable conduits, water lines, sewer lines, gas lines, oil lines, product pipelines, and [[environmental remediation]] casings. It is used for crossing waterways, roadways, shore approaches, congested areas, environmentally sensitive areas, and areas where other methods are costlier or not possible. It is used instead of other techniques to provide less traffic disruption, lower cost, deeper and/or longer installation, no access pit, shorter completion times, directional capabilities, and environmental safety.\n\nThe technique has extensive use in urban areas for developing subsurface utilities as it helps in avoiding extensive open cut trenches. The use requires that the operator have complete information about existing utilities so that they can plan the alignment to avoid damaging those utilities. Since uncontrolled drilling can lead to damage, different agencies/government authorities owning the urban [[Right of way (public throughway)|''right-of-way'']] or the utilities have rules for safe work execution. For standardization of the techniques, different [[trenchless]] technology promoting organizations have developed guidelines for this technique.\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Horizontal Drilling 2.JPG|thumb|Starting pit with pilot hole and some drilling fluid in the pit]]\n\nThe process starts with the receiving hole and entrance pits. These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to reduce costs and prevent waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path, and the second stage (reaming) enlarges the hole by passing a larger cutting tool known as the [[back reamer]]. The reamer's diameter depends on the size of the pipe to be pulled back through the bore hole. The driller increases the diameter according to the outer diameter of the conduit and to achieve optimal production. The third stage places the product or casing pipe in the enlarged hole by way of the drill stem; it is pulled behind the reamer to allow centering of the pipe in the newly reamed path.\n\nHorizontal directional drilling is done with the help of a [[viscous]] fluid known as [[drilling fluid]]. It is a mixture of water and, usually, [[bentonite]] or [[polymer]] continuously pumped to the cutting head or drill bit to facilitate the removal of cuttings, stabilize the bore hole, cool the cutting head, and lubricate the passage of the product pipe. The drilling fluid is sent into a machine called a reclaimer which removes the drill cuttings and maintains the proper viscosity of the fluid. Drilling fluid holds the cuttings in suspension to prevent them from clogging the bore. A clogged bore creates back pressure on the cutting head, slowing production.\n\n==Locating and guidance==\n\n[[Image:Horizontal Drilling 5.JPG|thumb|Empty conduits laid by directional boring]]\n\nLocation and guidance of the drilling head is an important part of the drilling operation, as the drilling head is under the ground while drilling and, in most cases, not visible from the ground surface. Uncontrolled or unguided drilling can lead to substantial destruction, which can be eliminated by properly locating and guiding the drill head.\n\nThere are three types of locating equipment for locating the bore head: the ''walk-over'' locating system, the ''wire-line'' locating system and the gyro guided drilling, where a full [[inertial navigation system]] is located close to the drill head.\n\n* Walk-over locating system \u2014 A sonde, or transmitter, behind the bore head registers angle, rotation, direction, and temperature data. This information is encoded into an electromagnetic signal and transmitted through the ground to the surface in a walk-over system. At the surface a receiver (usually a hand-held ''locator'') is manually positioned over the sonde, the signal is decoded and steering directions are relayed to the bore machine operator.\n* Wire-line locating system \u2014 The wire-line system is a magnetic guidance system. With a magnetic guidance system (MGS), the tool reads inclination and azimuth. The MGS, also has a secondary means of location verification utilizing wire grids laid on the ground surface. It is the only system that has the capability of verifying the location. This information is transmitted through the wire-line fitted within the drill string. At the surface, the navigator in the drill cab performs the necessary calculations to confirm the parameters have been met. The MGS, even without the use of the wire grid, has been accurate to over 2&nbsp;km with an accuracy of 2% at depth. The operator of the MGS communicates with the driller and guides him towards a predetermined engineered drill path.\n* Gyro-based locating system \u2014 The gyro based system is fully autonomous and therefore one of the most accurate systems where sufficient diameter {{nowrap|(200 mm)}} is available and where long distances {{nowrap|(up to 2 km)}} have to be traversed with minimal deviation (less than {{nowrap|1 m}} position error). Currently the actual depth is not verifiable without the use of surface coils, a near surface transponder or sonde used in walkover systems. \n\nAll three systems have their own merits, and a particular system is chosen depending upon the site requirements.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trenchless technology]]\n* [[Underground pneumatic boring]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*Willoughby, David (2005).

Uncontrolled or unguided drilling can lead to substantial destruction, which can be eliminated by properly locating and guiding the drill head.\n\nThere are three types of locating equipment for locating the bore head: the ''walk-over'' locating system, the ''wire-line'' locating system and the gyro guided drilling, where a full [[inertial navigation system]] is located close to the drill head.\n\n* Walk-over locating system \u2014 A sonde, or transmitter, behind the bore head registers angle, rotation, direction, and temperature data. This information is encoded into an electromagnetic signal and transmitted through the ground to the surface in a walk-over system. At the surface a receiver (usually a hand-held ''locator'') is manually positioned over the sonde, the signal is decoded and steering directions are relayed to the bore machine operator.\n* Wire-line locating system \u2014 The wire-line system is a magnetic guidance system. With a magnetic guidance system (MGS), the tool reads inclination and azimuth. The MGS, also has a secondary means of location verification utilizing wire grids laid on the ground surface. It is the only system that has the capability of verifying the location. This information is transmitted through the wire-line fitted within the drill string. At the surface, the navigator in the drill cab performs the necessary calculations to confirm the parameters have been met. The MGS, even without the use of the wire grid, has been accurate to over 2&nbsp;km with an accuracy of 2% at depth. The operator of the MGS communicates with the driller and guides him towards a predetermined engineered drill path.\n* Gyro-based locating system \u2014 The gyro based system is fully autonomous and therefore one of the most accurate systems where sufficient diameter {{nowrap|(200 mm)}} is available and where long distances {{nowrap|(up to 2 km)}} have to be traversed with minimal deviation (less than {{nowrap|1 m}} position error). Currently the actual depth is not verifiable without the use of surface coils, a near surface transponder or sonde used in walkover systems. \n\nAll three systems have their own merits, and a particular system is chosen depending upon the site requirements.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trenchless technology]]\n* [[Underground pneumatic boring]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*Willoughby, David (2005).

Other solutions, such as [[benzalkonium chloride]] and [[chlorhexidine|chrohexidine gluconate]], are less effective. The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like

[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Underneath the mask Atom-Smasher is revealed to look exactly like Rothstein. Barry is convinced by Joe and the others that he needs help in taking down certain metahumans and Rothstein is defeated by over absorbing [[radiation]]. As he dies, Rothstein tells Barry that he was sent to kill him by someone called \"[[Hunter Zolomon (Arrowverse)|Zoom]]\".

Zoom brings another metahuman from Earth-2 called Sand Demon, later identified as Eddie Slick, to kill the Flash. Cisco analyzes the \"sand\" left behind and has a vision of the previous fight, frightening him. After Slick kidnaps Officer [[Patty Spivot (Arrowverse)|Patty Spivot]], Jay teaches Barry how to hurl lightning. Cisco uses his power to find Patty's location.

Barry tracks down Snart, who is revealed not to be kidnapped but is working with his father, [[Lewis Snart|Lewis]]. Lisa states that Snart would never work with Lewis willingly, because the latter was abusive toward her when she was a child. Eventually, the team determines that Lewis placed a bomb inside of Lisa and threatened to kill her if Snart did not help him with his theft. Barry infiltrates Lewis' crew with assistance from Snart. Cisco successfully removes the bomb from Lisa, so Snart uses his cold gun to [[Parricide|kill his father]] in retaliation. Snart is incarcerated in Iron Heights and Lisa leaves.

Hewitt is excited to merge with Stein, but the attempt fails and Hewitt leaves angrily, not knowing that his own metahuman powers have been activated. Jefferson initially refuses, but agrees when Hewitt goes on rampage. After the successful merger, the new Firestorm joins Barry in helping to take down Hewitt, who is incarcerated. Before departing with Jefferson, Stein encourages Cisco to tell the others about his powers. Meanwhile, Francine reveals that she is suffering from a [[terminal illness]] and only has months to live.

Cisco has a vibe of Barry and realizes that he is still alive and in the speed force. Barry meets physical manifestations of the speed force in the form of faces familiar to him. The speed force informs Barry that he cannot leave unless he catches a mysterious moving figure, thus gaining his speed back. Cisco and Wells create a path into the speed force so Barry can escape, but the latter chooses to remain so he can earn his powers back. The speed force tells Barry that he cannot become the Flash again until he finally accepts Nora's death. Barry shares a moment with the physical manifestation of Nora, which allows him to finally catch the moving figure himself. With his powers restored and help from Cisco and Iris, Barry returns to S.T.A.R. Labs in time to save the team from the reanimated corpse of [[Tony Woodward (Arrowverse)|Tony Woodward]].

After Henry's funeral, Hunter challenges Barry to a race to determine who is faster, threatening to kill everyone Barry loves if he refuses. Harrison discovers Hunter is in possession of a magnetar, a device that will destroy every planet in the Multiverse except Earth-1 which requires both their speeds to power. When an enraged and vengeful Barry refuses to back out, the team locks him in the Pipeline and force Zolomon back to Earth-2 themselves; but Hunter abducts Joe in the process. Wally discovers this and frees Barry, who agrees to Zolomon's race. As Barry races Zolomon around the magnetar, he creates a time remnant of himself who frees Joe and destroys the machine, but at the cost of his life. The \"prime\" Barry defeats Zolomon, who is then taken away by Time Wraiths for his crimes against the timeline. Barry rescues the man in the iron mask, who is revealed to be the real Jay Garrick, Henry's Earth-3 doppelg\u00e4nger.

The follow-up invasion of Scotland under the command of Edward's brother, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] failed to install Albany on the throne, but Berwick has remained English ever since the castle surrendered on 24 August 1482.

Edward IV seized this new opportunity to invade Scotland, hired Master Douglas and his ship on 9 May, and summoned fighting-men for the cause of the \"king of Scotland\" on 10 May. Edward IV, Albany and [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] made a formal treaty at [[Fotheringhay Castle]] near [[Peterborough, England|Peterborough]], where [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was imprisoned and executed a century later. According to the treaty, Alexander, if he became King of Scotland, would reserve to Edward IV the town of [[Berwick upon Tweed]], [[Lochmaben Castle]] with land in southern Scotland in [[Annandale]], [[Liddesdale]], [[Eskdale, Scotland|Eskdale]] and [[Ewesdale]]. He would do homage to Edward IV and break the [[Auld Alliance]] with France. If he could extract himself from other engagements in the sight of the Church, he would marry Cecily of York. He had already married Anne de la Tour, the daughter of the [[House of La Tour d'Auvergne|Count of Auvergne and Bouillon]] in January.

He also paid bills from July for minting an unpopular base-metal copper \"black money\" coinage and \u00a3214 for iron used for making serpentines and other guns, and arranged for the repayment of money seized from George Robison, the customs officer of Edinburgh, at Lauder.<ref>''Exchequer Rolls of Scotland'', vol.9, Edinburgh (1886), 218\u2013220: the bond is printed in ''Foedera.''</ref>\n\nAlbany went to [[Dunbar Castle]] and renewed his treaty with Edward IV in February 1483. The new treaty was made at Westminster by Henry Earl of Northumberland, John Lord Scrope and William Parr with the Earl of Angus, Andrew Lord Grey and James Liddale of Halkerston. This had the unintended effect of strengthening home support for his elder brother.<ref>''Foedera'', vol.5 part 2, Hague (1741), p.127-128: Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (1982), 180, 184</ref> Albany was forfeited as a traitor by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in June 1483, for making this new treaty, not for the events of the previous summer.<ref>''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol.2 (1814), p.147</ref> After a period of exile, joined with the Earl of Douglas, his next attempt in Scotland was defeated at the [[Battle of Lochmaben Fair]].\n\nIn England the boast \"I was a captain when Barwycke was wonne\" became a commonplace saying and was included in the [[Eton College|Eton]] headmaster [[William Horman]]'s 1519 Latin phrasebook ''Vulgaria'' as \"Duxi ordin\u0113 q\u0148 Berwik\u0169 venit in potest\u0113.\"<ref>Horman, William, ''Vulgaria'', Richard Pynson (1519), f. 261v.</ref>\n\n==The Scottish chronicles and Berwick Castle==\n[[File:Trinity Altarpiece.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Trinity Altarpiece]] shows from right, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]] facing [[James III of Scotland|James III]] with their son [[James IV of Scotland|James, Duke of Rothesay]],<br>[[Royal Collection]] / [[National Gallery of Scotland]]]]\nThe sixteenth century Scottish chronicles present a differing story. All accounts emphasise the coinage of the \"black metal\" currency and its devaluation as major factor in the King's unpopularity at Lauder,<ref>Holmes, Nicholas''Scottish Coins'' (NMS, 1998), pp. 22\u201327, for the \"black money.\"</ref> along with his favouritism of non-noble upstarts. [[Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie]], probably writing in the 1570s, misunderstands the Treaty of Fotheringhay and presents Albany as his brother's rescuer after the coup at Lauder Bridge, seeking English support at the King's request. After Gloucester comes to Edinburgh and James III is released, the royal brothers ride together from the Castle to [[Holyroodhouse]]. Then Pitscottie has the brothers and the Duke of Gloucester travel to [[Stirling Castle|Stirling]] and tour Scotland.<ref>Dalyell, ed., ''Robert Lindsay's: Chronicles of Scotland'', vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1814), pp. 184\u2013201, see external links.</ref> This may represent Albany's labours to build his faction while James III remained in Edinburgh Castle after Gloucester's departure.\n\nThe idea that Albany brought an army to rescue his brother appears in the brief chronicle written by the [[Jedburgh]] monk [[Adam Abell]] in the 1530s. The historian [[Norman Macdougall]] supposed the sixteenth century writers were influenced by later stories which praised the Albany Stewarts and notes an apparently pro-Albany appendix to a manuscript of [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s chronicle which omits Gloucester's invasion in 1482.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (1982), pp. 275\u2013281, 314.</ref> Another early narrative, a 1492 Italian life of Margaret of Denmark, possibly informed by the recollections of a Scottish student at Bologna, merely states that James III was imprisoned for a time after a period of unsatisfactory rule with the consent of his wife and brother.<ref>Chandler, S. B., 'An Italian life of Margaret of Scotland' in ''Scottish Historical Review'', vol.32 no.113 part 1 (April 1953), pp.52\u201357, by Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti.</ref>\n\nHistory which showed James III in a bad light and was positive about Albany may have been pleasing to the courtiers of James IV and Albany's son, [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|John, Regent Albany]]. Macdougall calls this effect the \"Albany legend,\" which combined with the [[Parliament of Scotland|parliamentary record]] published by [[Robert Lekprevik]] in 1566 shaped the writings of these historians in the 1570s.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'', (1982), 283.</ref> Other records such as the valuable \"golden charter\" on 16 November 1482 by which James III rewarded the town of Edinburgh with the customs duties of [[Leith]] contributed to this legend. The charter recorded the loyal and hearty services of the whole community of Edinburgh ''and Albany'' in freeing him from Edinburgh castle.<ref>''Extracts form the Records of Edinburgh, 1403\u20131528'' (Edinburgh, 1869).</ref>\n\nJohn Lesley, who knew of Alexander's pretension to be king in 1482, has Gloucester take Berwick on his return to England after vigorous defence by [[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell|Sir Patrick Hepburn of Dunsyre, Lord Hailes]], and significant English casualties.  An addition to the English [[Croyland Chronicle]] also records that [[Berwick Castle]] was taken by Gloucester on his return after \"vast slaughter and bloodshed,\" a phrase similar to that used by Edward IV in his letter to the Pope.<ref>Riley, Henry, ed., ''Ingulph's chronicle of the abbey of Croyland'', Bohn, London (1854), p.481</ref> [[George Buchanan]] has Albany at [[Lennoxlove]] camped with the English army in August and reconciled by the negotiation of [[Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll|Colin Campbell]], [[Earl of Argyll]], the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor]] [[Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avandale|Andrew Stewart]], and the Bishops of [[Patrick Graham (bishop)|St Andrews]] and [[John Herspolz|Dunblane]]. On 26 August, according to Buchanan, Berwick Castle, still held by Scotland separately from the town, was surrendered by negotiation in Edinburgh to England.<ref>Leslie, John, ''The History of Scotland'' (Bannatyne Club, 1830), pp. 49\u201350: Buchanan, George, ''History of Scotland'', book 12, chap.49, various editions.</ref>\n\nThe English writer [[Raphael Holinshed]], who used Lesley as a source, understood that James III had gone to Lauder Bridge to meet his brother's invasion. He has [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] and Sir John Elrington, (the English war treasurer), holding Berwick town while Gloucester went forward to Edinburgh and camped at [[Restalrig]] and Lord Hailes defended Berwick Castle. Holinshed and Lesley mention an English navy in the Forth, not mentioned by other writers, although a record of its armament survives. Holinshed adds that after his reconciliation Albany sent an army south to aid Lord Hailes at Berwick which reached [[Lammermuir Hills|Lammermuir]], and like Lesley simply says 24 August was the date that Patrick Hepburn yielded the castle, as Hepburn knew there was little hope of relief because of the dissension in Scotland.<ref>Holinshed, London (1586), p.282-283 see external links (use of Lesley is indicated in Holinshed's margins): Holinshed, ''The Scottish chronicle or, a complete history and description of Scotland'' Arbroath (1805), p.108-110: The 'Scots' Lesley (1830) has 24 August, Dalrymple's 1590s [[Scots Language]] translation of Lesley, and the 2nd Latin edition (1675) give the date 23 August; Cody, ed., vol.2 SHS (1895), 98; ''De origine moribus'', (1675), p.310: the appointment of the naval commander is in ''Foedera'', vol.5 part 2 (Hague, 1741),</ref>\n\n===The English chronicles: Hall (1542), Grafton (1569), Stow (1580)===\nThe English chronicle of [[John Stow]] first published in 1580 adds more details. Edward IV, says Stow, invaded Scotland at Albany's request, \"forgetting his oath,\" and borrowing \u00a35,000 from the [[City of London]]. The sum is less than the 8,000 marks or \u00a35,333 of Cecilia's dowry received by James III.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (1982), p. 117.</ref> The army mustered at [[Alnwick]] at the start of July. There were three \"battles\" as mentioned in George Cely's newsletter. The vanguard was commanded by the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] with [[John Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope of Bolton]], Sir John Middleton, Sir John Ditchfield, and 6,700 soldiers. Gloucester formed the middle section, with Albany, Francis Lovell, [[Baron Greystock|Lord Greystock]], Sir Edward Woodville, and 5,800 men. Lord Neville followed with 3,000; [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas, Lord Stanley]] on the right of the Duke with 4,000; [[Baron FitzHugh|Lord Fitzhugh]], Sir William Parr and Sir James Harrington on the left with 2,000; while 1,000 men guarded the carriage of the ordnance.\n\nStow and [[Richard Grafton]] called the keeper of Berwick Castle, Patrick Hepburn, \"Earl of Bothwell,\" a title he acquired in October 1488. As Hepburn would not yield the castle, 4,000 troops were left to besiege it with Stanley, Parr, and the [[Treasurer of the Household|household treasurer]], Sir John Elrington. On the way to Edinburgh the army burnt numerous towns and castles. [[Edward Hall]]'s earlier ''Chronicle'' published in 1542 supplied the battle order and gave a list of some forty places burned by Gloucester en route and other places burned by the Earl of Northumberland (who carried out a parallel campaign in the borders) agreeing in number with Cely's newsletter. Richard Grafton in his ''Chronicle at Large'' published in 1569 has the same detail of the army as Hall, but like Cely states 44 towns were burnt. Much of Grafton's chronicle is taken from directly from Hall but his deviations are sometimes of interest.<ref>Grafton, Richard, ''Grafton's Chronicle: The Chronicle at Large, 1569'', vol.2 London (1809), p.73</ref>\n\nHall has nothing to say about Lauder, and wrote that James III voluntarily enclosed himself in Edinburgh Castle,<ref>Hall, Edward, (1809), 332.</ref> which coincides with the detail of Lord Darnley's secret contract. Stow says the Scottish army lay at [[Haddington, Scotland|Haddington]], and Albany was reconciled with the lords much as described by George Buchanan, and made \"Lieutenant-General of Scotland,\" an appointment made or renewed in December.\n[[File:Cranshaws Castle - geograph.org.uk - 142497.jpg|thumb|Edward Hall and John Lesley wrote that Albany mustered the Scottish army at [[Cranshaws Castle]] in the [[Lammermuir Hills]] to save Berwick Castle from his former allies]]\nHall's ''Chronicle'' has the army entering Edinburgh without any destruction at Albany's request, and issuing a public proclamation for James III in the castle, while the Scottish lords and army were at Haddington. After the reconciliation, Hall describes an indenture made at the English camp at Lennoxlove (Lethington), just south of Haddington, on 3 August between Albany and Gloucester wherein Albany promised to deliver on his treaty at Fotheringhay despite his new agreement.\n\nHall quotes the 4 August bond of the community of Edinburgh for the dowry repayment, Grafton has Albany direct the city of Edinburgh to make the bond after Berwick castle surrendered, but as in Hall, Grafton has the [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter Herald King at Arms]] return to Edinburgh on 23 October to request payment on the 4 August bond. The date is nearly correct; Edward IV decided to abandon the marriage plan and redeem the bond and the Garter herald [[John Writhe]] came to Edinburgh on 26 October. On the herald's return Duke of Gloucester withdrew from Newcastle to [[Sheriff Hutton]]. Hall and Grafton continue that Albany only now let James III out of the Castle, after having previously besieged him there, though records show James III was released earlier.<ref>Grafton, vol. 2 (1809), 76\u201377: Hall, (1809), 336: Macdougall, Norman (1982), p.169: (the sequence fits the letters to Lord Darnley in ''Lennox Book'', vol.2)</ref>\n\nSoon after 4 August, in Hall's ''Chronicle'', as in Holinshed and Lesley, as \"Lieutenant-General of Scotland,\" Albany summoned the army to relieve Berwick Castle to meet on 8 August at [[Cranshaws]] on the way to Duns, but told Gloucester it was a pretence. Gloucester declared that if Albany opposed him at Berwick, he would defend the besiegers or die in the attempt.<ref>Grafton, vol.2, (1809), 75.</ref> However, the council of Scotland was reluctant to fight and instead drafted a surrender of Berwick Castle by treaty in Edinburgh on 24 August. When the document was sealed by both parties, which would be a couple of days later as Gloucester was now at Berwick or Alnwick, Berwick Castle was delivered straightaway, \"incontinent,\" to Lord Stanley.<ref>Hall, Edward (1809), p.334.</ref> It is possible either that the castle fell to Stanley before Albany's negotiations with the council were completed and agreed by Gloucester, as Edward IV's letter to the Pope may suggest, or that Edward IV anticipated the castle would be taken by force when he wrote.\n[[File:Cessford Castle.jpg|thumb|The Earl of Northumberland knighted his commanders at the mains of [[Cessford Castle]] on 22 August 1480 or 1482]]\nHall's 1542 chronicle, compiled using English historical materials, may be less affected by the \"Albany legend\" than the Scottish accounts and certainly shows Albany acting with duplicity, yet he concludes these events of 1482 with a lamentation of Albany's eventual fate, comparable with the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]], caused by the \"prime envy\" of James III against \"his brother, the only organ and instrument by whom he obtained liberty and freedom,\" which seems at odds with his own account of the invasion.<ref>Hall, p. 338: Grafton, p. 78.</ref>\n\nStow says when Berwick Castle was delivered to Stanley, Sir Thomas Molyneux of [[Haughton, Nottinghamshire|Haughton]] was knighted there as a banneret. Among the burnt places mentioned by Edward Hall, \"[[Hutton, Scottish Borders|Hooton]]\" and \"[[Hutton Castle|Heton Hall]]\" must be the Hatton-Field, \"Hoton feld besyde Berwyke\" where Gloucester is said to have knighted Sir [[Ralph de Ashton|Ralph Assheton]] of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] as a banneret, and knighted Thomas, Lord Scrope of Masham and 26 others. These knights were made on 22 August, about the time of the surrender of Berwick Castle, and so Richard seems to have travelled back from Newcastle. The Earl of Northumberland is said to have knighted 18 men at the \"mayne of Sefford,\"[[Cessford, Scottish Borders|Cessford]] in the Scottish Middle-march, during a previous campaign, on 22 August 1480, or at the same time. A grand total of 70 knights and bannerets including Molyneux and [[Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle|Edward Stanley]] were made on 24 August which seems to mark the end of hostilities.<ref>Burke, ''A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies'', (1844) p.20 Assheton, 360 Molyneux: Metcalfe, Walter Charles, ''A book of Knights Banneret etc.,'', London (1885), p.5-7, citing BL Cotton Ms. Claudius, c.iii, fol. 61\u201367: [[William Arthur Shaw]], [https://archive.org/details/knightsofengland02shawuoft ''Book of Knights'', vol.2 (1906)], p. 20 includes knights made at Cessford in 1482.</ref> The occasion on the 22 August may have prompted Edward's letter to the Pope.\n\nStow concludes with the Duke of Gloucester returned to [[Sheriff Hutton]] and Edward IV rewarding the [[Lord Mayor of London|Mayor of London]], William \"Harriot,\" and some of aldermen of the city with a feast and hunting at [[Waltham Forest]]. The feast appears in other chronicles of Edward IV as an example of his princely [[largesse]], not connected with the Scottish expedition: the city loan of 5000 marks but not the Scottish expedition is mentioned under the year 1482 in [[Robert Fabyan|Fabyan's]] chronicle.<ref>Howes, Edmund, ''Annales, or, a Generall Chronicle of England begun by John Stow'', London (1631/2), p.432: Ellis, Henry, ed., ''Fabyan's new chronicles of England and France, 1516'', (1811), pp. 656-7.</ref>\nStow's description of a city loan and reward are corroborated by surviving documents; Edward IV's Garter King of Arms gave the bond from Edinburgh to William Heryot, Mayor of London on 11 October 1482.

The town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] and its castle were captured and the English army briefly occupied Edinburgh. These events followed the signing of the Treaty of Fotheringhay, 11 June 1482, in which [[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany]], the brother of [[James III of Scotland]] declared himself [[King of Scotland]] and swore loyalty to [[Edward IV of England]]. The follow-up invasion of Scotland under the command of Edward's brother, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] failed to install Albany on the throne, but Berwick has remained English ever since the castle surrendered on 24 August 1482. The English army left Edinburgh with a promise for the repayment of the dowry paid for the marriage of [[Cecily of York|Princess Cecily of England]] to the [[James IV of Scotland|Scottish Prince]].\n\n==Treaty of Fotheringhay==<!-- the redirect Treaty of Fotheringhay links here change the name here (why?)  change the link in the redirect (why?)-->\nEdward IV was disappointed by the failure of his 1474 treaty with James III who had promised that his son, [[James IV of Scotland|Prince James]] would marry [[Cecily of York]]. The betrothal was made in October 1474 with a forty-five year truce to last until 1519. Her dowry payments were to be made yearly on 3 February in Edinburgh, brought by Edward's servants from [[Norham Castle]], and a meeting was to be held to resolve the dispute over the 'fish-garth,' a salmon trap on the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|Esk]].<ref>Rymer, ''Foedera'', vol. 11, pp. 820\u201334: see [https://books.google.com/books?id=9CocpxjDzuoC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Rymer, Thomas, ''Foedera, conventiones, literae,... inter Reges Angliae et alios'', vol. 5 part 1 & 2 (Johannes Neaulm, Hague, 1741)] part 2, pp. 44, 47\u201353.</ref> Since February 1475, Edward's officers had delivered installments of Cecilia's 20,000 [[Mark (money)|mark]] dowry to James's treasurer in [[St Giles' Cathedral|St Giles, Edinburgh]].<ref>Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', vol.4 (London, 1888), nos. 1425, 1434, 1437, 1444, 1446, 1449, 1450, 1456.</ref>\n\nHowever, border conflict had restarted in 1480, perhaps due to Scotland's [[Auld Alliance]] with France.<ref>Ross, Charles, ''Edward IV'', University of California, (1974), p.213, 278\u20139</ref> According to a chronicle, the [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus|Earl of Angus]] had attacked [[Bamburgh Castle]], and the [[Earl of Northumberland]] had raided in Scotland.<ref>Kirkby, Joan, ed., ''Plumpton letters'', CUP/Camden, (1996), p. 56: Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (John Donald, Edinburgh, 1982), p. 311.</ref> By October 1480, James III had written to [[Louis XI of France]] asking for guns and artillerymen to repulse further attacks.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Milan'', vol.1 (London, 1912),  p.245</ref> Eleven ships were put on war-footing for Scotland in February 1481 and Sir Robert Radcliffe was commanded to arm a fleet with guns and gunners on 8 July.

There does not seem to have been a land based invasion of Scotland, but there were three raids into England by a Scottish army in that year. Edward IV had made invasion preparations and began to travel north, but went no further than [[Nottingham]].<ref>Ross, Charles, ''Edward IV'' (University of California, 1974), pp. 281\u20133.</ref>\n\nIn May 1482 James III's brother, Alexander, Duke of Albany landed in England at Southampton from France in a Scottish [[Caravel|carvel]], the ''Michael'', captained by James Douglas. Edward IV seized this new opportunity to invade Scotland, hired Master Douglas and his ship on 9 May, and summoned fighting-men for the cause of the \"king of Scotland\" on 10 May. Edward IV, Albany and [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] made a formal treaty at [[Fotheringhay Castle]] near [[Peterborough, England|Peterborough]], where [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was imprisoned and executed a century later. According to the treaty, Alexander, if he became King of Scotland, would reserve to Edward IV the town of [[Berwick upon Tweed]], [[Lochmaben Castle]] with land in southern Scotland in [[Annandale]], [[Liddesdale]], [[Eskdale, Scotland|Eskdale]] and [[Ewesdale]]. He would do homage to Edward IV and break the [[Auld Alliance]] with France. If he could extract himself from other engagements in the sight of the Church, he would marry Cecily of York. He had already married Anne de la Tour, the daughter of the [[House of La Tour d'Auvergne|Count of Auvergne and Bouillon]] in January. On 11 June 1482, Albany signed \"Alexander R.,\" for Alexander, Rex.<ref>Thomas Rymer, ''Foedera'', vol. 5 part 1 & 2 (Johannes Neaulm, Hague, 1741), pp. 120-1.</ref>\n\n==The invasion==\nEdward IV had been preparing an army of 20,000 men to invade Scotland by sea and land, and on 12 June 1482 Richard, Duke of Gloucester was made commander, with John Elrington appointed war-treasurer on 22 June.<ref>''Foedera'', vol.12, p.158</ref> One of his officers, [[Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell|Francis Lovell]], had his orders before 24 June 1482, as he wrote that he could not travel south from [[Tanfield, Durham|Tanfield]] near [[Durham, England|Durham]] for the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|feast of John the Baptist]] as he had a command in Gloucester's army.<ref>''Calendar Documents Scotland'', vol.5, Scottish Record Office (n.d.) p.303 no.1100</ref>  Equipped with 2,000 sheaves of arrows and ordnance brought from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] by 120 cart horses, Gloucester and Albany recaptured Berwick.

Richard, Duke of Gloucester also moved west to [[Kimmerghame]] with the support of [[James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas|James, Earl of Douglas]] but near [[Duns]] turned north-west to Edinburgh.<ref>Hall, ''Chronicle'', (1809), p.332 list of place names, mostly between Berwick and Duns.</ref>\n\nThe Scottish army of James III got no further south than [[Lauder]] Bridge, to the west of Gloucester's route, where there was some kind of mutiny involving [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus|Archibald, Earl of Angus]]. The exact events at Lauder are unclear, but chronicles relate that some of the king's favourites including the architect [[Robert Cochrane (architect)|Robert Cochrane]], merchant Thomas Preston and composer Sir William Roger were hanged from the bridge.<ref>http://www.lauder.bordernet.co.uk/history/articles/jamesiii.html</ref>\n\nJames III was brought back to Edinburgh on 22 July 1482. There were now three clear factions in Scotland; Albany's party, the loyalists, and the Lauder mutineers. The Queen at Stirling with Prince James may also have had independent influence. A London merchant, George Cely, wrote a letter with exaggerated news of the campaign in July;<blockquote>\"the Dewke of Albany ys comyn ynto Ynglond and he has sworne to Kyngys good grace, and the King hasse sent hym ynto Scottland wyth 60,000 men yn iii battelles and many lordys of Ynglond wyth hym, ...

Albany, his brother's party, and the keepers of the castle became reconciled. On 2 August Albany and Gloucester signed a bond with [[Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll|Colin, Earl of Argyll]], [[William Scheves|Archbisbop Scheves]], [[Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avandale|Lord Avandale]], and the [[James Livingston (bishop)|Bishop of Dunkeld]] which promised a pardon for Albany and the restoration of his previous dignities.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'', (1982), p.168: ''Foedera'', vol.12 (1711), p.160</ref>\n\nThe English army made a truce on 4 August 1482 and withdrew with an undertaking from the town of Edinburgh to repay an advance on Cecilia's dowry which Edward had given to James III.

He also paid bills from July for minting an unpopular base-metal copper \"black money\" coinage and \u00a3214 for iron used for making serpentines and other guns, and arranged for the repayment of money seized from George Robison, the customs officer of Edinburgh, at Lauder.<ref>''Exchequer Rolls of Scotland'', vol.9, Edinburgh (1886), 218\u2013220: the bond is printed in ''Foedera.''</ref>\n\nAlbany went to [[Dunbar Castle]] and renewed his treaty with Edward IV in February 1483. The new treaty was made at Westminster by Henry Earl of Northumberland, John Lord Scrope and William Parr with the Earl of Angus, Andrew Lord Grey and James Liddale of Halkerston. This had the unintended effect of strengthening home support for his elder brother.<ref>''Foedera'', vol.5 part 2, Hague (1741), p.127-128: Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (1982), 180, 184</ref> Albany was forfeited as a traitor by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in June 1483, for making this new treaty, not for the events of the previous summer.<ref>''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol.2 (1814), p.147</ref> After a period of exile, joined with the Earl of Douglas, his next attempt in Scotland was defeated at the [[Battle of Lochmaben Fair]].\n\nIn England the boast \"I was a captain when Barwycke was wonne\" became a commonplace saying and was included in the [[Eton College|Eton]] headmaster [[William Horman]]'s 1519 Latin phrasebook ''Vulgaria'' as \"Duxi ordin\u0113 q\u0148 Berwik\u0169 venit in potest\u0113.\"<ref>Horman, William, ''Vulgaria'', Richard Pynson (1519), f. 261v.</ref>\n\n==The Scottish chronicles and Berwick Castle==\n[[File:Trinity Altarpiece.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Trinity Altarpiece]] shows from right, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]] facing [[James III of Scotland|James III]] with their son [[James IV of Scotland|James, Duke of Rothesay]],<br>[[Royal Collection]] / [[National Gallery of Scotland]]]]\nThe sixteenth century Scottish chronicles present a differing story. All accounts emphasise the coinage of the \"black metal\" currency and its devaluation as major factor in the King's unpopularity at Lauder,<ref>Holmes, Nicholas''Scottish Coins'' (NMS, 1998), pp. 22\u201327, for the \"black money.\"</ref> along with his favouritism of non-noble upstarts. [[Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie]], probably writing in the 1570s, misunderstands the Treaty of Fotheringhay and presents Albany as his brother's rescuer after the coup at Lauder Bridge, seeking English support at the King's request. After Gloucester comes to Edinburgh and James III is released, the royal brothers ride together from the Castle to [[Holyroodhouse]]. Then Pitscottie has the brothers and the Duke of Gloucester travel to [[Stirling Castle|Stirling]] and tour Scotland.<ref>Dalyell, ed., ''Robert Lindsay's: Chronicles of Scotland'', vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1814), pp. 184\u2013201, see external links.</ref> This may represent Albany's labours to build his faction while James III remained in Edinburgh Castle after Gloucester's departure.\n\nThe idea that Albany brought an army to rescue his brother appears in the brief chronicle written by the [[Jedburgh]] monk [[Adam Abell]] in the 1530s. The historian [[Norman Macdougall]] supposed the sixteenth century writers were influenced by later stories which praised the Albany Stewarts and notes an apparently pro-Albany appendix to a manuscript of [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s chronicle which omits Gloucester's invasion in 1482.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (1982), pp. 275\u2013281, 314.</ref> Another early narrative, a 1492 Italian life of Margaret of Denmark, possibly informed by the recollections of a Scottish student at Bologna, merely states that James III was imprisoned for a time after a period of unsatisfactory rule with the consent of his wife and brother.<ref>Chandler, S. B., 'An Italian life of Margaret of Scotland' in ''Scottish Historical Review'', vol.32 no.113 part 1 (April 1953), pp.52\u201357, by Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti.</ref>\n\nHistory which showed James III in a bad light and was positive about Albany may have been pleasing to the courtiers of James IV and Albany's son, [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|John, Regent Albany]]. Macdougall calls this effect the \"Albany legend,\" which combined with the [[Parliament of Scotland|parliamentary record]] published by [[Robert Lekprevik]] in 1566 shaped the writings of these historians in the 1570s.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'', (1982), 283.</ref> Other records such as the valuable \"golden charter\" on 16 November 1482 by which James III rewarded the town of Edinburgh with the customs duties of [[Leith]] contributed to this legend. The charter recorded the loyal and hearty services of the whole community of Edinburgh ''and Albany'' in freeing him from Edinburgh castle.<ref>''Extracts form the Records of Edinburgh, 1403\u20131528'' (Edinburgh, 1869).</ref>\n\nJohn Lesley, who knew of Alexander's pretension to be king in 1482, has Gloucester take Berwick on his return to England after vigorous defence by [[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell|Sir Patrick Hepburn of Dunsyre, Lord Hailes]], and significant English casualties.  An addition to the English [[Croyland Chronicle]] also records that [[Berwick Castle]] was taken by Gloucester on his return after \"vast slaughter and bloodshed,\" a phrase similar to that used by Edward IV in his letter to the Pope.<ref>Riley, Henry, ed., ''Ingulph's chronicle of the abbey of Croyland'', Bohn, London (1854), p.481</ref> [[George Buchanan]] has Albany at [[Lennoxlove]] camped with the English army in August and reconciled by the negotiation of [[Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll|Colin Campbell]], [[Earl of Argyll]], the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor]] [[Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avandale|Andrew Stewart]], and the Bishops of [[Patrick Graham (bishop)|St Andrews]] and [[John Herspolz|Dunblane]]. On 26 August, according to Buchanan, Berwick Castle, still held by Scotland separately from the town, was surrendered by negotiation in Edinburgh to England.<ref>Leslie, John, ''The History of Scotland'' (Bannatyne Club, 1830), pp. 49\u201350: Buchanan, George, ''History of Scotland'', book 12, chap.49, various editions.</ref>\n\nThe English writer [[Raphael Holinshed]], who used Lesley as a source, understood that James III had gone to Lauder Bridge to meet his brother's invasion. He has [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] and Sir John Elrington, (the English war treasurer), holding Berwick town while Gloucester went forward to Edinburgh and camped at [[Restalrig]] and Lord Hailes defended Berwick Castle. Holinshed and Lesley mention an English navy in the Forth, not mentioned by other writers, although a record of its armament survives. Holinshed adds that after his reconciliation Albany sent an army south to aid Lord Hailes at Berwick which reached [[Lammermuir Hills|Lammermuir]], and like Lesley simply says 24 August was the date that Patrick Hepburn yielded the castle, as Hepburn knew there was little hope of relief because of the dissension in Scotland.<ref>Holinshed, London (1586), p.282-283 see external links (use of Lesley is indicated in Holinshed's margins): Holinshed, ''The Scottish chronicle or, a complete history and description of Scotland'' Arbroath (1805), p.108-110: The 'Scots' Lesley (1830) has 24 August, Dalrymple's 1590s [[Scots Language]] translation of Lesley, and the 2nd Latin edition (1675) give the date 23 August; Cody, ed., vol.2 SHS (1895), 98; ''De origine moribus'', (1675), p.310: the appointment of the naval commander is in ''Foedera'', vol.5 part 2 (Hague, 1741),</ref>\n\n===The English chronicles: Hall (1542), Grafton (1569), Stow (1580)===\nThe English chronicle of [[John Stow]] first published in 1580 adds more details. Edward IV, says Stow, invaded Scotland at Albany's request, \"forgetting his oath,\" and borrowing \u00a35,000 from the [[City of London]]. The sum is less than the 8,000 marks or \u00a35,333 of Cecilia's dowry received by James III.<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James III'' (1982), p. 117.</ref> The army mustered at [[Alnwick]] at the start of July. There were three \"battles\" as mentioned in George Cely's newsletter. The vanguard was commanded by the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] with [[John Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope of Bolton]], Sir John Middleton, Sir John Ditchfield, and 6,700 soldiers. Gloucester formed the middle section, with Albany, Francis Lovell, [[Baron Greystock|Lord Greystock]], Sir Edward Woodville, and 5,800 men. Lord Neville followed with 3,000; [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas, Lord Stanley]] on the right of the Duke with 4,000; [[Baron FitzHugh|Lord Fitzhugh]], Sir William Parr and Sir James Harrington on the left with 2,000; while 1,000 men guarded the carriage of the ordnance.\n\nStow and [[Richard Grafton]] called the keeper of Berwick Castle, Patrick Hepburn, \"Earl of Bothwell,\" a title he acquired in October 1488. As Hepburn would not yield the castle, 4,000 troops were left to besiege it with Stanley, Parr, and the [[Treasurer of the Household|household treasurer]], Sir John Elrington. On the way to Edinburgh the army burnt numerous towns and castles. [[Edward Hall]]'s earlier ''Chronicle'' published in 1542 supplied the battle order and gave a list of some forty places burned by Gloucester en route and other places burned by the Earl of Northumberland (who carried out a parallel campaign in the borders) agreeing in number with Cely's newsletter. Richard Grafton in his ''Chronicle at Large'' published in 1569 has the same detail of the army as Hall, but like Cely states 44 towns were burnt. Much of Grafton's chronicle is taken from directly from Hall but his deviations are sometimes of interest.<ref>Grafton, Richard, ''Grafton's Chronicle: The Chronicle at Large, 1569'', vol.2 London (1809), p.73</ref>\n\nHall has nothing to say about Lauder, and wrote that James III voluntarily enclosed himself in Edinburgh Castle,<ref>Hall, Edward, (1809), 332.</ref> which coincides with the detail of Lord Darnley's secret contract. Stow says the Scottish army lay at [[Haddington, Scotland|Haddington]], and Albany was reconciled with the lords much as described by George Buchanan, and made \"Lieutenant-General of Scotland,\" an appointment made or renewed in December.\n[[File:Cranshaws Castle - geograph.org.uk - 142497.jpg|thumb|Edward Hall and John Lesley wrote that Albany mustered the Scottish army at [[Cranshaws Castle]] in the [[Lammermuir Hills]] to save Berwick Castle from his former allies]]\nHall's ''Chronicle'' has the army entering Edinburgh without any destruction at Albany's request, and issuing a public proclamation for James III in the castle, while the Scottish lords and army were at Haddington. After the reconciliation, Hall describes an indenture made at the English camp at Lennoxlove (Lethington), just south of Haddington, on 3 August between Albany and Gloucester wherein Albany promised to deliver on his treaty at Fotheringhay despite his new agreement.\n\nHall quotes the 4 August bond of the community of Edinburgh for the dowry repayment, Grafton has Albany direct the city of Edinburgh to make the bond after Berwick castle surrendered, but as in Hall, Grafton has the [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter Herald King at Arms]] return to Edinburgh on 23 October to request payment on the 4 August bond. The date is nearly correct; Edward IV decided to abandon the marriage plan and redeem the bond and the Garter herald [[John Writhe]] came to Edinburgh on 26 October. On the herald's return Duke of Gloucester withdrew from Newcastle to [[Sheriff Hutton]]. Hall and Grafton continue that Albany only now let James III out of the Castle, after having previously besieged him there, though records show James III was released earlier.<ref>Grafton, vol. 2 (1809), 76\u201377: Hall, (1809), 336: Macdougall, Norman (1982), p.169: (the sequence fits the letters to Lord Darnley in ''Lennox Book'', vol.2)</ref>\n\nSoon after 4 August, in Hall's ''Chronicle'', as in Holinshed and Lesley, as \"Lieutenant-General of Scotland,\" Albany summoned the army to relieve Berwick Castle to meet on 8 August at [[Cranshaws]] on the way to Duns, but told Gloucester it was a pretence. Gloucester declared that if Albany opposed him at Berwick, he would defend the besiegers or die in the attempt.<ref>Grafton, vol.2, (1809), 75.</ref> However, the council of Scotland was reluctant to fight and instead drafted a surrender of Berwick Castle by treaty in Edinburgh on 24 August. When the document was sealed by both parties, which would be a couple of days later as Gloucester was now at Berwick or Alnwick, Berwick Castle was delivered straightaway, \"incontinent,\" to Lord Stanley.<ref>Hall, Edward (1809), p.334.</ref> It is possible either that the castle fell to Stanley before Albany's negotiations with the council were completed and agreed by Gloucester, as Edward IV's letter to the Pope may suggest, or that Edward IV anticipated the castle would be taken by force when he wrote.\n[[File:Cessford Castle.jpg|thumb|The Earl of Northumberland knighted his commanders at the mains of [[Cessford Castle]] on 22 August 1480 or 1482]]\nHall's 1542 chronicle, compiled using English historical materials, may be less affected by the \"Albany legend\" than the Scottish accounts and certainly shows Albany acting with duplicity, yet he concludes these events of 1482 with a lamentation of Albany's eventual fate, comparable with the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]], caused by the \"prime envy\" of James III against \"his brother, the only organ and instrument by whom he obtained liberty and freedom,\" which seems at odds with his own account of the invasion.<ref>Hall, p. 338: Grafton, p. 78.</ref>\n\nStow says when Berwick Castle was delivered to Stanley, Sir Thomas Molyneux of [[Haughton, Nottinghamshire|Haughton]] was knighted there as a banneret. Among the burnt places mentioned by Edward Hall, \"[[Hutton, Scottish Borders|Hooton]]\" and \"[[Hutton Castle|Heton Hall]]\" must be the Hatton-Field, \"Hoton feld besyde Berwyke\" where Gloucester is said to have knighted Sir [[Ralph de Ashton|Ralph Assheton]] of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] as a banneret, and knighted Thomas, Lord Scrope of Masham and 26 others. These knights were made on 22 August, about the time of the surrender of Berwick Castle, and so Richard seems to have travelled back from Newcastle. The Earl of Northumberland is said to have knighted 18 men at the \"mayne of Sefford,\"[[Cessford, Scottish Borders|Cessford]] in the Scottish Middle-march, during a previous campaign, on 22 August 1480, or at the same time. A grand total of 70 knights and bannerets including Molyneux and [[Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle|Edward Stanley]] were made on 24 August which seems to mark the end of hostilities.<ref>Burke, ''A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies'', (1844) p.20 Assheton, 360 Molyneux: Metcalfe, Walter Charles, ''A book of Knights Banneret etc.,'', London (1885), p.5-7, citing BL Cotton Ms. Claudius, c.iii, fol. 61\u201367: [[William Arthur Shaw]], [https://archive.org/details/knightsofengland02shawuoft ''Book of Knights'', vol.2 (1906)], p. 20 includes knights made at Cessford in 1482.</ref> The occasion on the 22 August may have prompted Edward's letter to the Pope.\n\nStow concludes with the Duke of Gloucester returned to [[Sheriff Hutton]] and Edward IV rewarding the [[Lord Mayor of London|Mayor of London]], William \"Harriot,\" and some of aldermen of the city with a feast and hunting at [[Waltham Forest]]. The feast appears in other chronicles of Edward IV as an example of his princely [[largesse]], not connected with the Scottish expedition: the city loan of 5000 marks but not the Scottish expedition is mentioned under the year 1482 in [[Robert Fabyan|Fabyan's]] chronicle.<ref>Howes, Edmund, ''Annales, or, a Generall Chronicle of England begun by John Stow'', London (1631/2), p.432: Ellis, Henry, ed., ''Fabyan's new chronicles of England and France, 1516'', (1811), pp. 656-7.</ref>\nStow's description of a city loan and reward are corroborated by surviving documents; Edward IV's Garter King of Arms gave the bond from Edinburgh to William Heryot, Mayor of London on 11 October 1482.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]].

These councils are Nicaea (325 AD), Constantinople I (381), Ephesus (431), Chalcedon (451), Constantinople II (553), Constantinople III (680/81), and Nicaea II (787)... As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome. They boldly claim, \"This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers\" (AC XXI Conclusion 1).

Martin Luther was a great fan of music, and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services; in particular, Luther admired the composers [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Ludwig Senfl]] and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ''ars perfecta'' (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (community).<ref>Taruskin, Richard.

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]]. Private or family offices include the [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#HOW THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY Should Teach His Household to Bless Themselves in the Morning and in the Evening.|Morning and Evening Prayers]] from Luther's ''Small Catechism''.<ref name=daily>See [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.php#prayers Luther's Small Catechism, Daily Prayers]</ref> Meals are blessed with the ''[[Common table prayer]]'', {{bibleverse||Psalm|145:15\u201316|31}}, or other prayers, and after eating the Lord is thanked, for example, with {{bibleverse||Psalm|136:1|9}}.

These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship. Outreach is no longer given as the primary motivation; rather this form of worship is seen as more in keeping with the desires of individual congregations.<ref>Principle examples of this in the ELCA include [http://www.familyofgod.us Family of God, Cape Coral FL.], [http://www.the-well.org/ The Well, Charlotte NC], [http://www.hosannalc.org Hosanna! of Lakeville, Minnesota], and [http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php Church of the Apostles, Seattle WA.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820204437/http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php |date=20 August 2006 }}.</ref> In Finland, Lutherans have experimented with the {{illm|St Thomas Mass|fi|Tuomasmessu}} and [[Metal Mass]] in which traditional hymns are adapted to heavy metal. Some Laestadians enter a heavily emotional and [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state during worship. The [[Lutheran World Federation]], in its Nairobi Statement on Worship and Culture, recommended every effort be made to bring church services into a more sensitive position with regard to cultural context.<ref>\"A given culture's values and patterns, insofar as they are consonant with the values of the Gospel, can be used to express the meaning and purpose of Christian worship.

Along with these, the most widely used among English speaking congregations include: ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary]]'' (1996, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]), ''The [[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (1978, [[Lutheran Council in the United States of America]]), ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (1982, LCMS), ''[[Christian Worship Hymnal|Christian Worship]]'' (1993, [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]), and ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'' (1941, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]]). In the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], the official hymnal is the ''Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement'' of 1986, which includes a supplement to the ''Lutheran Hymnal'' of 1973, itself a replacement for the ''Australian Lutheran Hymn Book'' of 1921. Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia ([[History of the Lutheran Church of Australia#Merge of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia|which merged in 1966]]) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language. Spanish-speaking ELCA churches frequently use ''Libro de Liturgia y C\u00e1ntico'' (1998, Augsburg Fortress) for services and hymns.

They condemned the Philippist position for [[indifferentism]], describing it as a \"unionistic compromise\" of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.<ref>Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations. Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the \"whole counsel of God\" (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10)<ref>For a historical example, see Robert Preus, ''To Join or Not To Join''. [[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], 1968.</ref> before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]].

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

Recently, the Swedish succession was introduced into all of the Porvoo Communion churches, all of which have an episcopal polity. Although the Lutheran churches did not require this or change their doctrine, this was important in order for more strictly high church Anglican individuals to feel comfortable recognizing their sacraments as valid. The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.

In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance.

Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church.

[[Lutheran scholasticism]] developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the [[Jesuits]], and it was finally established by [[Johann Gerhard]].

As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome.

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]].

These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations.

[[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], 1968.</ref> before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]].

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.

Eastern Orthodox Laestadians are known as [[:ru:\u0423\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0435\u0442|Ushkovayzet]] (article is in Russian).<ref>[http://uralistica.com/profiles/blogs/karelskoe-religioznoe Karelian religious movement Uskhovayzet]</ref>\n\n====Eastern Europe and Asian Russia====\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Nevsky various 06.jpg|thumb|[[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] in St. Petersburg]]\nAlthough historically Pietism had a significant influence on the understanding of the ministry among Lutherans in the Russian Empire,{{efn|See [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442,_\u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434|Edward Wust]] and [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c|Wustism]] in the Russian Wikipedia for more on this.}} today nearly all Russian and Ukrainian Lutherans are influenced by Eastern Orthodox polity. In their culture, giving a high degree of respect and authority to their bishops is necessary for their faith to be seen as legitimate and not sectarian.<ref>[https://www.sonntagsblatt.de/artikel/kirche/ihre-gemeinde-ist-annulliert Kirche weltweit Ukraine: \"Ihre Gemeinde ist annulliert\"] 18.09.2016 by Von Helmut Frank]</ref> In Russia, lines of succession between bishops and the canonical authority between their present-day hierarchy is also carefully maintained in order to legitimize the existing Lutheran churches as present day successors of the former Lutheran Church of the Russian Empire originally authorized by Catherine the Great. This allows for the post-Soviet repatriation of Lutheran church buildings to local congregations on the basis of this historical connection.<ref>[https://logia.org/pdf-back-issues/15-1pdf-lutheranism-in-asia A New \"Old\" Lutheran Church in Asian Russia] by Alexei Streltsov, in Logia, Epiphany 2006: Volume 15, Number 1</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, several dynamics encouraged Lutherans to maintain a different form of polity. First, due to de facto practice during the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] the subsequent legal principal of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or \"Evangelical\" (that is, Lutheran under the ''Augsburg Confession''). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies [[Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegel]], further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.\n\n====Western Hemisphere and Australia====\n[[File:Ministerium Hymnal.jpg|thumb|right|The Pennsylvania Ministerium published this 1803 hymnal.<ref>This website has [https://hymnary.org/hymnal/HELC1865 text and midi files] for the 1865 Pennsylvania Ministerium hymnal.</ref>]]\nDuring the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,<ref>Abdel Ross Wentz (1954), ''A Basic History of Lutheranism in America'', Philadelphia, Pa., p. 41</ref><ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent. This congregation was expelled from the Missouri Synod for a while over this, but they challenged it and got back in.</ref> In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,<ref>Due to influence from former Missourians joining the ELCA in the [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]]</ref> the Wisconsin Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Missouri Synod, teachers at parochial schools are considered to be clergy, with the latter defending this before the [[Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Supreme Court in 2012]].
