The language is also spoken by minority populations of the neighbouring states of [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. The region has been known at different stages of history as [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Odra Desha|Udra]], [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] or [[Western Odisha|Hirakhanda]]. Odisha was a vast empire in [[ancient]] and [[medieval]] times, extending from the [[Ganges]] in the north to the [[Godavari]] in the south. During [[British rule]], however, Odisha lost its political identity and formed parts of the Bengal and Madras Presidencies. The present state of Odisha was formed in 1936. The modern Odia language is formed mostly from [[Pali]] words with significant Sanskrit influence. About 28% of modern Odia words have [[Adivasi]] origins, and about 2% have Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu), Persian, or Arabic origins. The earliest written texts in the language are about thousand years old. The first Odia newspaper was [[Utkala Deepika]] first published on 4 August 1866.\n\n[[Odia language|Odia]] is the only Indo-European language of India other than [[Sanskrit]] and the sixth Indian language that has been conferred [[classical language]] status and forms the basis of [[Odissi dance]] and [[Odissi music]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Odia gets classical language status|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odia-gets-classical-language-status/article5709028.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 20 February 2014|access-date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Odia becomes sixth classical language|url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140221/jsp/frontpage/story_18004148.jsp#.VjZc7rcrLIU|website = The Telegraph|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = ODISSI \u2013 A DISTINCT STYLE OF INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC|url = http://chandrakantha.com/misra/odissi.html|website = chandrakantha.com|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have divided the history of the Odia language literature into five main stages: Old Odia (800 AD to 1300 AD), Early Medieval Odia (1300 AD to 1500 AD), Medieval Odia (1500 AD to 1700 AD), Late Medieval Odia (1700 AD to 1850 AD) and Modern Odia (1850 AD to present). Further subdivisions, as seen below, can more accurately chart the language's development.\n\n== First literature of Odisha (4th century BC)==\nThe ancientness of the Odia literature is being proved from its soil which says about two types of literature from very beginning. The creativity, development and preservation of Odia language and literature through ages can be seen in its spoken (in the form of folk lores) and written forms (e.g. rock edicts, manuscripts). The songs sung after birth, death, while working, and during festivals have helped to preserve the language in the first way (i.e. spoken form) by getting transferred through generations, while, the stories painted in cave paintings have constituted preservation in the second way (i.e. written form). The inhabitants of this land started to drown this language about 15,000 years ago. The Gudahandi painting of Kalahandi district and the cave art of [[Khandagiri]] and [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]] are the great achievements of this primitive architecture.\n\n[[Kharavela]]'s [[Hathigumpha inscription|Hatigumpha inscription]] serves as evidence of past Odia cultural, political, ritual, and social status and is the 1st poetic stake inscription. Though Ashoka had created many rock edicts and inscriptions before [[Kharavela]], yet his instructions for administration have been written in a rude and chocked language. On the other hand, the [[Hathigumpha inscription|Hatigumpha inscription]] shows the flexibility of the language in a sweet flow.\n\nMain feature of this inscription was based on principles of Sanskrit poetic structure: such as-\n\n{{Quote|Sadvanshah kshyatriya b\u00e2 pi dhiirod\u00e2ttah gunanwit\u00e2h I<br>\nEkabanshodva bhup\u00e2h\u00e2 kulaj\u00e2 bahabo pi J\u00e2 II<br>\nShrungarabirashant\u00e2n\u00e2mekoangirasa ishyate I<br>\nAng\u00e2ni sarbe<pi ras\u00e2ha sarbe n\u00e2takasandhy\u00e2h\u00e2 II<br>\nItih\u00e2sodvabam bruttam\u00e2n\u00e2nyad b\u00e2 sajjan\u00e2shrayam I<br>\nChatwarastasya bargah\u00e2 syusteshwekam cha phalam bhavet II<br>\nA\u00e2dyu namaskriyashrib\u00e2 bastunirddesha eba b\u00e2 I<br>\nKwacinnind\u00e2 khal\u00e2din\u00e2m sat\u00e2m cha gunakirttinam II<br>\n(S\u00e2hitya darpan-  Biswan\u00e2th kabir\u00e2j)}}\n\nIt means that such creations will be called as poem which Protagonist would be Dhirodatta belonging to an untouchable kshtriya. In Rasa (aesthetics) Srunag\u00e2ra (Love, Attractiveness), V\u00eera (Heroic mood), S\u00e2nta (Peace or tranquility) among them one would be the main rasa and others are remain with them as usual. All aspects of drama, historic tales and other legendary folklores are present. The description of all the fourfold-Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokshya are still present here, but one should be given priority than other theme. At the beginning it should be written as respective, blissful and subject aware with welfare of people being hatred towards evil and devotional towards sages/saints.\n\nWhen [[Hathigumpha inscription|Hatigumpha Inscription]] was created by [[Kharavela]], all these principles were traced by him before, which has been followed by [[Rudradaman]] (Girinar inscription 150 AD), [[Samudragupta]] (Prayaga inscription 365 AD), Kumargupta (Mandasore inscription 473 AD), created their own famous creativities in a decent poetic style on many rocks in the Sanskrit language. The trend of writing was not obstructed after Kharavela. From Asanapata inscription in Keonjhar created by [[Satrubhanja|Satru Bhanja]], (a warrior of Odisha) were engraved in the temple, Laxminarayana of Simhanchalam by Mukunda Deva are such examples. In the beginning, these inscriptions had a dynamic journey from Pali to Sanskrit. They have not lost the sense of Odia. Therefore, Odia language, literature, script and culture are based on the discussions on these inscriptions. The words written in the Hatigumpha Inscription are still used in the present day Odia language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prusty|first1=Subrat Kumar|last2=Pattanayak|first2=Debi Prasanna|title=Classical Odia in Historical Perspective|date=2015|publisher=Odisha Sahitya Akademi|location=Bhubaneswar|isbn=9788175861985|page=94|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Age of Charya literature (7th to 8th centuries AD)==\nThe beginnings of Odia poetry coincide with the development of [[Charyapada]] or [[Caryagiti]], a literature started by [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] poets.<ref name=\"Mukherjee \">Mukherjee, Prabhat. ''The History of medieval Vaishnavism in Odisha''. Chapter: ''The Sidhacharyas in Odisha'' Page 55.</ref> This literature was written with a certain metaphor called \"Sandhya Bhasha\", and some of its poets like Luipa and Kanhupa came from the same territory as present day Odisha. The language of Charya was considered to be [[Prakrit]].  In one of his poem, Kanhupa wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Your hut stands outside the city<br>Oh, untouchable maid<br>The bald Brahmin passes sneaking close by<br>Oh, my maid, I would make you my companion<br>Kanha is a kapali, a yogi<br>He is naked and has no disgust<br>There is a lotus with sixty-four petals<br>Upon that the maid will climb with this poor self and dance.}}\n\nIn this poem [[shakti]] is replaced by the image of the \"untouchable maid\". The description of its location outside the city corresponds to being outside the ordinary consciousness. Although she is untouchable the bald Brahmin, or in other words so-called wise man, has a secret hankering for her. But only a ''kapali'' or an extreme tantric can be a fit companion for her, because he is also an outcast. The kapali is naked because he does not have any social identity or artifice. After the union with the shakti, the shakti and the kapali will climb on the 64-petalled lotus [[Sahasrara]] [[chakra]] and dance there.\n\nThis poet used images and symbols from the existing social milieu or collective psychology so that the idea of a deep realization could be easily grasped by the readers. This kind of poetry, full of the mystery of tantra, spread throughout the northeastern part of India from the 10th to the 14th centuries, and its style of expression was revived by the Odia poets of the 16th to the 19th centuries.\n\n== Pre-Sarala Age (12th to 14th centuries AD) ==\nIn the pre-Sarala period, Natha and Siddha literature flourished in Odisha. The main works of this period are ''Shishu veda'' (an anthology of 24 dohas), ''Amara Kosha'' and ''Gorakha Samhita. Shishu veda'' is mentioned in the works of Sarala Das and the later 16th century poets. It is written in Dandi brutta.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of Oriya Literature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HkMLAQAAMAAJ|publisher = Vidya|date = 1 January 2006|isbn = 9788190343800|first = Jatindra Mohan|last = Mohanty}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Palm Leaf Etchings of Orissa|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=90_qAeMT1bwC|publisher = Abhinav Publications|date = 1 January 1989|isbn = 9788170172482|first = Durga Prasad|last = Patnaik}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of literature|url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofli01ship|url-access = registration|publisher = Philosophical Library|date = 1 January 1946|first = Joseph Twadell|last = Shipley}}</ref><ref name=\"Sahitya Akademi\">{{Cite book|title = Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC|publisher = Sahitya Akademi|date = 1 January 1997|isbn = 9788126003655}}</ref> Raja Balabhadra Bhanja wrote the love story, ''Bhagabati'' known for its emotional content.<ref name=\"Garg1992\">{{cite book|author=Ga\u1e45g\u0101 R\u0101m Garg|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&pg=PA77|year=1992|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-374-0|pages=77\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"odiya.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.odiya.org/misc/sahitya.shtml|title=History of Oriya Literature|access-date=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708065325/http://www.odiya.org/misc/sahitya.shtml|archive-date=8 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2014/mar/engpdf/26-29.pdf</ref> The other important works of this period are the ''Kalasha Chautisha'' (By Baccha Das)<ref name=\"RayR\u0101\u1e8fa1981\">{{cite book|author1=B.

The first great poet of Odisha with widespread readership is the famous [[Sarala Das]], who translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S37EdUramu0C&pg=PA171|title=In Translation|isbn=9027216797|last1=St-Pierre|first1=Paul|last2=Kar|first2=Prafulla C.|date=January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waWQ8mAUrC8C&pg=PA174|title=The Communication of Ideas|year=1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1188|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|isbn=9788126011940|last1=Datta|first1=Amaresh|year=1988}}</ref><ref name=\"books.google.co.in\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqGojPpe8DIC&pg=PA448|title=Indian Literature|year=1988}}</ref> This was not an exact translation from the Sanskrit original, but rather an imitation; for all practical purposes it can be seen as an original piece of work. Sarala Das was given the title Shudramuni, or seer from a backward class. He had no formal education and did not know Sanskrit.\n\nThis translation has since provided subsequent poets with the necessary foundation for a national literature, providing a fairly accurate idea of the Odia culture at the time. Sarala Dasa, born in the 15th century Odisha of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] emperor [[Kapilendradeva|Kapilendra Deva]], was acclaimed as the \"Adikabi\" or first poet. The reign of the Gajapatis is considered as the golden period for Odisha's art and literature. Kapilendra Deva patronized Odia language and literature along with Sanskrit unlike his predecessors who used only Sanskrit as their lingua franca. In fact a short Odia poem ''Kebana Munikumara'' is found in the Sanskrit Drama ''Parashurama Vijaya'' ascribed to none other than the emperor Kapilendra Deva himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsQBAAAAMAAJ|title=Sidelights on History and Culture of Orissa|last1=Das|first1=Manmath Nath|year=1977}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSduAAAAMAAJ|title=The Orissa Historical Research Journal|year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDNuAAAAMAAJ|title=Orissa District Gazetteers: Ganjam|last1=(India)|first1=Orissa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Colonialism and South Asia: Cuttack, 1803\u20131947|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3GzaAAAAMAAJ|publisher = R.N.

The word \"pancha\" means five and the word \"sakha\", friend.\n\nThe Panchasakhas were [[Vaishnavas]] by thought. In 1509, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Shri Chaitanya]] came to Odisha with his Vaishnava message of love. Before him, [[Jaydev]] had prepared the ground for Vaishnavism through his [[Gita Govinda]]. Chaitanya's path of devotion was known as Raganuga Bhakti Marga. He introduced chanting as a way to make spiritual connection & taught the importance of Hare krushna mantra. Unlike Chaitanya, the Panchasakhas believed in Gyana Mishra Bhakti Marga, similar to the Buddhist philosophy of Charya literature stated above.\n\nThe Panchasakhas were significant not only because of their poetry but also for their spiritual legacy. In the holy land of Kalinga (Odisha) several saints, mystics, and devotional souls have been born throughout history, fortifying its culture and spiritualism. The area uniquely includes temples of Shakti, Shiva and Jagann\u00e2tha Vishnu. Several rituals and traditions have been extensively practised here by various seers \u2013 including Buddhist ceremonies, Devi \"Tantra\" ([[Tantra|tantric]] rituals for Shakti), [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] Marg and [[Vaishnava Bhakthi|Vaishnava]] Marg. There is hardly any \"Sadhak\"  who did not pay a visit to the Shri Jagann\u00e2th temple.\n\nThere is an interesting description of the origin of the Panchasakhas, in Achyutananda's ''Shunya Samhita.''  As per his narration, towards the end of Mahabharat when Lord Krishna was leaving his mortal body, Nilakantheswara Mahadeva appeared & revealed to him that the Lord's companions Dama, Sudama, Srivatsa, Subala, and Subahu would reincarnate in the Kali-yuga & be known as Ananta, Acyutananda, Jagannatha, Balarama and Yasovanta, respectively. Thus, believers in the Panchasakha consider them the most intimate friends of Lord Krishna in Dwapara-yuga, who came again in Kali-yuga to serve him. They are also instrumental in performing the crucial & much-awaited Yuga-Karma where they destroy the sinners and save the saints, according to Sanatana-Hindu beliefs.\n\nBalaram Das's J''Agamohan Ramayan'' provided one pillar, along with Sarala-Das's ''Mahabharata'', upon which subsequent Odia literature was built. His ''[[Laxmi Puran|Lakshmi Purana]]'' is considered the first manifesto of women's liberation or feminism in Indian literature. His other major works are ''Gita Abakasa, Bhava samudra, Gupta Gita, Vedanta Sara, Mriguni Stuti, Saptanga yogasara tika, Vedanta sara or Brahma tika, Baula gai gita, Kamala lochana chotisa, Kanta koili, Bedha parikrama, Brahma gita, Brahmanda bhugola, Vajra kavacha, Jnana chudamani, Virata gita, Ganesha vibhuti & Amarakosha Gita.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://puriwaves.nirmalya.in/saints/balarama-das|title=Balarama Das|work=PURIWAVES}}</ref><ref name=\"odisha.gov.in\">http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2014/July/engpdf/69-73.pdf</ref>\n\nThe most influential work of this period was however [[Atibadi Jagannath Das]]'s ''Bhagabata'', which had a great influence on the Odia people as a day-to-day philosophical guide, as well as a lasting one in Odia culture. His other works include ''Gupta Bhagavat, Tula vina, Sola chapadi, Chari chapadi, Tola bena, Daru brahma gita, Diksa samyad, Artha koili, Muguni stuti, Annamaya kundali, Goloka sarodhara, Bhakti chandrika, Kali malika, Indra malika, Niladri vilasa, Nitya gupta chintamani, Sri Krishna bhakti kalpa lata''.<ref name=\"odisha.gov.in\"/>\n\nShishu Ananta Das was born in Balipatana near Bhubaneswar in the late 15th century.

After this time books were printed and journals and periodicals became available in Odia. The first Odia magazine, ''Bodha Dayini'' was published in Balasore in 1861. Its goal was to promote Odia literature and draw attention to lapses in government policy.  The first Odia paper ''The [[Utkala Deepika]]'', was first published in 1866 under editor [[Gourishankar Ray]] and Bichitrananda. ''The Utkal Deepika'' campaigned to bring all Odia-speaking areas together under one administration, to develop the Odia language and literature and to protect Odia interests.\n\nIn 1869 Bhagavati Charan Das started another newspaper, ''Utkal Subhakari'', to propagate the Brahmo faith. In the last three and a half decades of the 19th century, a number of newspapers were published in Odia. Prominent papers included ''Utkal Deepika'',''Utkal Patra'', ''Utkal Hiteisini'' from Cuttack, ''Utkal Darpan'' and ''Sambada Vahika'' from Balasore and ''Sambalpur Hiteisini'' from Deogarh. The success of these papers indicated the desire and determination of the people of Odisha to uphold their right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, with the ultimate aim of freedom from British rule. These periodicals performed another vital function, in that they encouraged modern literature and offered a broad reading base for Odia-language writers.  Intellectuals who came into contact with Odia literature through the papers were also influenced by their availability.\n\n[[Kabibar Radhanath Ray|Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908) is the most well-known poet of this period. He wrote with a Western influence, and his kavyas (long poems) included Chandrabhaga, Nandikeshwari, Usha, Mahajatra, Darbar and Chilika.\n\n[[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918), the most known Odia fiction writer, was also of this generation. He was considered the [[Fakir Mohan Senapati|Vyasakabi]] or founding poet of the Odia language. Senapati was born raised in the coastal town of Balasore, and worked as a government administrator. Enraged by the attempts of the [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] to marginalize or replace the [[Odia language]], he took to creative writing late in life. Though he also did translations from Sanskrit, wrote poetry and attempted many forms of literature, he is now known primarily as the father of modern Odia prose fiction. His ''[[Rebati]]'' (1898) is widely recognized as the first Odia short story. ''Rebati''  is the story of a young innocent girl whose desire for education is placed in the context of a conservative society in a backward Odisha village, which is hit by the killer [[cholera]] epidemic. His other stories are \"Patent Medicine\", \"Dak Munshi\", and \"Adharma Bitta\". Senapati is also known for his novel [[Chha Maana Atha Guntha]]. This was the first Indian novel to deal with the exploitation of landless peasants by a feudal lord. It was written well before the [[October revolution]] in Russia and emerging of Marxist ideas in India.\n\nOther eminent Odia writers and poets of the time include [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Madhusudan Rao]], [[Chintamani Mohanty]], [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875-1928) [[Gourishankar Ray]] (1838-1917) and [[Reba Ray]] (1876-1957).\n\n==Age of Satyabadi==\n{{main|Gopabandhu Das}}\nDuring the Age of Radhanath the literary world was divided between the classicists, led by the magazine ''[[The Indradhanu]]'', and the modernists, led by the magazine ''[[Bijuli (Odia magazine)|The Bijuli]]''. [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928) was a great balancer and realized that a nation, as well as its literature, lives by its traditions. He believed that a modern national superstructure could only endure if based on solid historical foundations.  He wrote a satirical poem in ''The Indradhanu'', which led to punishment by the Inspector of Schools, but he refused to apologise.\n\nGopabandhu joined [[Ravenshaw College]] in Cuttack to pursue graduation after this incident. He started the ''Kartavya Bodhini Samiti'' (Duty Awakening Society) in college to encourage his friends to take on social, economic and political problems and become responsible citizens. While leading a team to serve flood victims, Gopabandhu heard that his son was seriously ill. He preferred, however, to save the \"sons of the soil\" rather than his son. His mission was to reform society and develop education in the name of a social service vision. He lost his wife at age twenty-eight, and had already lost all three of his sons by this time. He left his two daughters and his property in the village with his elder brother, rejecting worldly life. For this social service mission he is regarded by Odias as the Utkalmani.\n\nAs freedom movements began, a new era in literary thought emerged influenced by Gandhi and the trend of nationalism. Gopabandhu was a large part of this idealistic movement, founding a school in Satyabadi and influencing many writers of the period.  Other than Gopabandhu himself, other famous writers of the era were Godabarisha Mishra, Nilakantha Dash, Harihara Acharya and Krupasinshu. They are known as 'Panchasakhas' for their similarities with the historical Age of Panchasakhas. Their principle genres were criticism, essays and poetry.\n\n[[Chintamani Das]] is particularly renowned.  Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village near Sakhigopal, he was bestowed with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his invaluable contribution to Odia literature. Some of his well-known literary works are ''Manishi Nilakantha'', ''Bhala Manisa Hua'', ''Usha'', ''Barabati'', ''Byasakabi Fakiramohan'' and ''Kabi Godabarisha''.\n\n== Pragati Yuga ==\nNabajuga Sahitya Sansad formed in 1935 was one of the first progressive literary organizations in India, contemporaneous to other [[Progressive Writers' Movement|progressive writers movements]]. The founders of the Progressive Movement in Odisha were Nabakrushna Choudhury, Bhagabati Panigrahi and Ananta Patnaik. At the inaugural session of Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad, the great freedom fighter Malati Choudhury sang \"Nabeena Jugara Taruna Jagare\" written by Ananta Patnaik. The mouth piece of Nabajuga Sahity Sansad was Adhunika, the First Progressive Literary Magazine in Odia. Adhuinka was conceived, initiated, edited, published and nurtured by Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi and Ananta Patnaik. Many writers of that time wrote in Adhunika.<ref name=\"Pati 2001 p. 86\">{{cite book | last=Pati | first=B. | title=Situating Social History: Orissa, 1800-1997 | publisher=Orient Longman | series=Madras District Gazetteers | year=2001 | isbn=978-81-250-2007-3 | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uJtnQN3KueEC&pg=PA86 | language=fr | access-date=2020-04-10 | page=86}}</ref><ref name=\"George Sahitya Akademi 1992 p. 307\">{{cite book | last=George | first=K.M. | author2=Sahitya Akademi | title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: Surveys and poems | publisher=Sahitya Akademi | series=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology | year=1992 | isbn=978-81-7201-324-0 | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&pg=PA307 | access-date=2020-04-10 | page=307}}</ref>\n\n==Age of Romanticism or Sabuja Yuga==\nInfluenced by the Romantic thoughts of Rabindranath Tagore during the 1930s when progressive Marxist movements dominated Odia Literature, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi (the brother of Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi who founded Marxism in Odisha) formed a group called \"Sabuja Samiti\" with two of his writer friends [[Annada Shankar Ray]] and Baikuntha Patnaik. This was a very short period in Odia literature, later folded into Gandhian and Marxist work. [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]] later wrote his famous novel ''[[Matira Manisha]]'', which was influenced by Gandhism, and Annada Shankar Ray left for Bengali literature.  Mayadhar Mansingh was a renowned poet of that time, but though he was considered a Romantic poet he kept his distance from the influence of Rabindranath.\n\n==''Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha''==\nThe ''Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha'' is a monumental 7-volume work of about 9,500 pages published between 1930 and 1940. It was a result of the vision and dedicated work of [[Gopal Chandra Praharaj]] (1874\u20131945) over nearly three decades. Praharaj not only conceived of and compiled the work, he also raised the finances to print it through public donations, grants and subscriptions and supervised the printing and the sales of the published work.\n\nThe Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is an Odia language dictionary that lists some 185,000 words and their meanings in four languages \u2013 Odia, English, Hindi and Bengali. It includes quotations from wide-ranging classical works illustrating the special usage of various words. It also contains specialised information such as botanical names of local plants, information on astronomy and long articles on various topics of local interest. In addition, there are biographies of personalities connected with Odisha's history and culture.\n\nThe Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is an encyclopedic work touching on various aspects of the Odia language and Odisha region, as well as many topics of general interest. Its author Praharaj was a lawyer by profession and was ridiculed and reviled by many during production itself. Many printed copies were destroyed unbound and unsold. Many copies sat in libraries of the princes who had patronised the work and most of these copies were sold cheaply when the princes met financial ruin. There are few surviving copies, and those that exist are fragile and worm-damaged. The work is regarded by the older generation, but not well known among younger Odias.\n\n==Post Colonial Age==\n\n===Poetry===\nAs the successors of Sachi Routray, the father of modern odia poetry, [[Guruprasad Mohanty]] and [[Bhanuji Rao]] were highly influenced by T.S. Eliot and published a co-authored poetry book ''Nutan Kabita''. Ramakanta Rath later modified Eliot's ideas in his own work. According to Rath : \"After the publication of Kalapurusha Guru Prasad's poetry collection influenced by T.S. Eliot\u2019s ''The Waste Land''] we realized that a sense of alienation is the main ingredient of modern poetry.\" Before independence Odia poetry was mostly written with Sanskritic or \"literary\" idiom, but after independence poets freely used of Western concepts, idioms, images and adaptation of Western myths.[[Ramakanta Rath]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]], [[Soubhagya Kumar Mishra]], [[Rajendra kishore Panda]], [[Pratibha Satpathy]], [[Mamata Dash]], Haraprasad Das are the most famous of these poets. From the mid 60s and into the 70s the prominent poets of Odia were : [[Radha Mohan Gadanayak]], Benudhar Rout, Brajanath Rath, Bangali Nanda, Harihar Mishra, Dipak Mishra, Kamalakant Lenka, Banshidhar Sarangi, Durga Charan Parida, [[Devdas Chhotray]], Saroj Ranjan Mohanty, Amaresh Patnaik, Ashutosh Parida, [[Prasanna Kumar Patasani|Prasanna Patsani]], [[Hussain Rabi Gandhi]], Sadasiba Dash.\n\nOther poets of this time are : Hrishkesh Mullick, Satrughna Pandab, Prabasini Mahakuda, Aaparna Mohanty, Aswini Mishra, Roninikant Mukherjee, Girija Baliarsingh, Dr.Goutam Jena(''Ranga Siuli'',''Bahuda Bela'') and Ramesh Pati . The early 80s saw in Odia literature a group of poets with new thoughts and styles who overshadowed the earlier generation. These poets had their root in typical Odia soil. The rich heritage and culture with the feelings of commomen were depicted in their Odia poems. They were somehow nearer to the readers as there were little ambiguity in their expression. These contemporary poems were better than the so-called modern poems. The prominent poets of this time included : [[Manasi Pradhan]]. Critics refer to them as the contemporary poet generation.{{who|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Odia Translation of World Classics===\nEminent scholar Prof. [[Ananta Charan Sukla]]'s celebrated Odia Translation (with Commentary, Critical Study and Notes) of Aristotle's Poetics (Aristotle-anka Kabyatatwa) published in the late 1960s is a rare and outstanding work. It is the second translation of the classic work in any Indian language after Bengali. His translation of four classic Greek plays is also a commendable work.\n\n===Fiction===\n\n====Before the 1970s====\nIn the post-independence era Odia fiction took a new direction. The trend [[Fakir Mohan Senapati|Fakir Mohan]] started developed more after independence, led by [[Gopinath Mohanty]] (1914\u20131991), [[Surendra Mohanty]] and [[Manoj Das]] (1934\u2013 ). These authors pioneered the trend of developing or projecting the \"individual as protagonist\" in Odia fiction. There is some tension between the two Mohantys among critics.  Eminent feminist writer and critic [[Sarojini Sahoo]] believes that it is not Gopinath's story \"Dan\", but rather Surendra Mohanty's \"Ruti O Chandra\" that should be considered the first story of the individualistic approach.<ref>Istahar-92, (26th Volume, 2nd Issue),</ref> The major difference between Surendra and Gopinath is that, where Gopinath is more optimistic, Surendra is nihilistic. This nihilism prepared the ground for the development an existentialist movement in Odia literature.\n\n[[Surendra Mohanty]] is a master of language, theme and concept. Some of his famous short story collections and novels are ''Krushna Chuda'', ''Mahanagarira Rati'', ''Ruti O Chandra'', ''Maralara Mrutyu'', ''Shesha Kabita'', ''Dura Simanta'', ''Oh Calcutta'', ''Kabi-O- Nartaki'', ''Sabuja Patra-O-Dhusara Golap'', ''Nila Shaila'' and ''Andha Diganta''.\n\nIn his fiction [[Gopinath Mohanty]] explores all aspects of Odishan life, both in the plains and in the hills. He uses a unique prose style, lyrical in style, choosing worlds and phrases from the day-to-day speech of ordinary men and women. Gopinath's first novel, ''Mana Gahtra Chasa'', was published in 1940, followed by Dadi Budha (1944), Paraja (1945) and Amrutara Santan (1947). He published 24 novels, 10 collections of short stories, three plays, two biographies, two volumes of critical essays and five books on the languages of Kandh, Gadaba and Saora tribes. He also translated Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (''Yuddh O Shanti'') in three volumes (tr. 1985\u201386) and Togore's ''Jogajog'' (tr. 1965) into Odia.\n\nThe writer [[Kalpanakumari Devi]]'s sequence of novels, in particular, her ''Srushti o pralaya'' (1959), documenting the social change in the country have been lauded.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111231/jsp/odisha/story_14945271.jsp#.Vn8gMRGl2FU|author=Namita Panda|date=31 December 2011|title=Furore over award to Kalpanakumari}}</ref>\n\nStarting his literary career as a communist and later becoming an Aurobindian philosopher, [[Manoj Das]] proved himself as a successful bilingual writer in Odia and English. His major Odia works are: ''Shesha Basantara Chithi'' (1966), ''Manoj Dasanka Katha O Kahani'' (1971), ''Dhumabha Diganta'' (1971), ''Manojpancabimsati'' (1977) and ''Tuma Gam O Anyanya Kabita'' (1992). Notable English works include ''The crocodile's lady : a collection of stories'' (1975), ''The submerged valley and other stories'', ''Farewell to a ghost : short stories and a novelette'' (1994), ''Cyclones'' (1987) and ''A tiger at twilight'' (1991).\n\nRenowned writer Ananta Charan Sukla's short story collection, \"Sulataku Sesa Chitthi\" (Last Letter to Sulata) published in 1965 is also worth mentioning. The ten stories included in this book are \"Sulataku Sesa Chitthi\", \"Kapilas\", \"Janeika Kulapati-nka Mrutyu\", \"Tandril Ru Tornoto\", \"Mystic Realistic\", \"Prasanta Samudra: Asanta Lahari\", \"Nalakula Matha, Nepala Babu O Narana\", \"Daudana Bada Khara\", \"Duragata\" and \"Sandipani-ra Symphony\". Other significant pre-1970s fiction writers are Chandrasekhar Rath, [[Santanu Kumar Acharya|Shantanu Kumar Acharya]], [[Mohapatra Nilamani Sahoo]], Akhil Mohan Patnaik, Gobind Das, Rabi Patnaik and [[Jagannath Prasad Das]]. Chandra Sekhar Rath's novel ''Jantrarudha'' is one of the renowned classics of this period. Shantanu Acharya's novel Nara-Kinnara was also influential.\n\n====After the 1970s====\n\nThe trends started by the 1950s and 1960s were challenged by the young writers in the 1970s. This challenge began in the 1960s with a small magazine ''Uan Neo Lu'' in Cuttack. The title of the magazine was made up of three of the Odia alphabets, which were not in use. Writers associated with the magazines included Annada Prasad Ray, Guru Mohanty (not to be confused with Guru Prasad), Kailash Lenka and Akshyay Mohanty. These writers were not as famous as some contemporaries, but they began a revolution in Odia fiction. They tried to break the monopoly of established writers, introducing sexuality in their work and creating a new prose style. In the late 1960s the Cuttack's in Odia Literature was broken when many \"groups\" of writers emerged from different parts of Odisha. Anamas from Puri, Abadhutas from Balugaon, Panchamukhi from Balangir, Abujha from Berhampur and Akshara group from Sambalpur created a sensation in Odia literary scene.\n\nThe changes that started in the 1960s were confirmed in the next decade. Jagadish Mohanty, Kanheilal Das, Satya Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Tarun Kanti Mishra, Padmaja Pal, [[Yashodhara Mishra]] and Sarojini Sahoo created a new era in Odia fiction. Kanheilal Das and Jagadish Mohanty began creating a new style and language popular among a general audience as well as intellectuals. Kanheilal Das died young and is still considered a great loss for Odia fictions. [[Jagadish Mohanty]] introduced [[existentialism]] to Odia literature. His renowned works include ''Ekaki Ashwarohi'', ''Dakshina Duari Ghara'', ''Album'', ''Dipahara Dekhinathiba Lokotie'', ''Nian O Anyanya Galpo'', ''Mephestophelesera Pruthibi'', ''Nija Nija Panipatha'', ''Kanishka Kanishka, Uttaradhikar'' and ''Adrushya Sakal''.\n\nRamchandra Behera is known for short story collections ''Dwitiya Shmashana'', ''Abashishta Ayusha'', ''Omkara Dhwani'', ''Bhagnangshara Swapna'' and ''Achinha Pruthibi''.  Padmaj Pal is also known for short story collections including ''Eaglera Nakha Danta'', ''Sabuthu Sundar Pakshi'', ''Jibanamaya'' and ''Uttara Purusha''. Tarun Kanti Mishra emerged during 1970s as a powerful storyteller with an elegant style, full of poise and vigor. His outstanding works include 'Sharadah Shatam' ( A Thousand Autumns), \u2013 a novel dealing with resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh\u2014and anthologies of short stories such as 'Komal Gandhar', 'Bitansa', 'Bhaswati' and 'Akash Setu'.\n\nSarojini Sahoo, another prominent writer, later famous as a feminist writer, also significantly contributed to Odia fiction. Her novel ''Gambhiri Ghara'' is not only a landmark Odia novel but has also gained international fame for its feminist and liberal ideas. Her other works include ''Amrutara Pratikshare'', ''Chowkatha'', ''Upanibesh'', ''Pratibandi'', ''Paksibasa'', ''Tarlijauthiba Durga'', ''Dukha Apramita'', ''Gambhiri Ghara'' and ''Mahajatra''. Kanaklata Hati, another women fiction writer in whose writing we will find psychoanalysis of female mind. To date she has published two-story collections- 'Nirbak Pahada' & 'Kuhudi Ghara'. She has some translated story collections like 'Galpa Galpantara' and'Praibeshi Galpa'.\n\n====Popular fiction writings====\nA popular Odia literature also emerged in the 1970s, read by rural populace especially women. The best selling writers are Bhagirathi Das, Kanduri Das, Bhagwana Das, [[Bibhuti Patnaik]] and [[Pratibha Ray]].  Some of their works were made into films in the Odia language. In recent times Rabi Kaunungo, [[Tarun Kanti Mishra]], Ajay Swain, Mrinal Chatterjee, Radhu Mishra, Dr Laxmikant Tripathy, Nisith Bose, Suniti Mund, Anjan Chand and Dr. Kulangara have contributed to popular writing.\n\n====Women's writings and feminism====\nThe founding of a women's magazine called ''Sucharita'' in 1975 by [[Sakuntala Panda]] had a significant impact in helping female writers find a voice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some of those writers are Giribala Mohanty, Jayanti Rath, [[Susmita Bagchi]]. [[Paramita Satpathy]], [[Hiranmayee Mishra]], [[Chirashree Indra Singh]], [[Sairindhree Sahoo]], [[Supriya Panda]], [[Gayatri Saraf]], [[Suniti Mund]] and [[Mamatamayi Chowdhry]]. [[Giribala Mohanty (Odia Writer)|Giribala Mohanty]] (1947\u2013) needs a special introduction for her deep sensitiveness for women's issues. Her poems depict the emotional binary of social apathy and the self-confidence of women. Her collections of Poems 'Streeloka' (Women), 'Kalijhia' (The Dark complexion Girl),'Ma Habara Dukha' (The sorrow of being a mother) and 'Kati Katia Katyayani' expresses her feelings in a lucid and lyrical way. [[Sarojini Sahoo]] had a significant influence on these women, paving the way with a feminist approach to fiction and the introduction of sexuality in her work.  She is known as the [[Simone de Beauvoir]] of India, though theoretically she denies the Hegelian theory of \"[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]\" developed by de Beauvoir in her ''[[The Second Sex]]''. Unlike de Beauvoir, Sahoo claims that women are an \"Other\" from the masculine perspective, but that they are entitled to equal human rights according to [[Plato]]. Suniti Mund's Story Book 'Anustupa', Poetry Book 'Jhia' And Novel 'Abhisapta', 'Agarbatira Ghara', 'Matrimony dot com','Gigolo' is also a feminist voice.\n\n==Drama==\nThe traditional Odia theater is the folk opera, or Jatra, which flourishes in the rural areas of Odisha. Modern theater is no longer commercially viable, but in the 1960 experimental theatre made a mark through the works of [[Manoranjan Das]], who pioneered a new theater movement with his brand of experimentalism. Bijay Mishra, Biswajit Das, Kartik Rath, Ramesh Prasad Panigrahi, Ratnakar Chaini, Prasanna Das, Pramod Kumar Tripathy, Sankar Tripathy, Ranjit Patnaik, Dr. Pradip Bhowmic, Hemendra Mahapatra, and Purna Chandra Mallick continued the tradition. Tripathy's contribution to the growth and development of the immensely popular and thought-provoking ''lok natakas'' is universally recognised and he is often called the Rousseau of lok natakas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Noted writer [[Ananta Charan Sukla]]'s Odia translation of four classic Greek dramas is a rare contribution to Odia drama literature. His book, \"Greek Drama\", published in 1974, has translations (with commentary) of Prometheus Bound (by Aeschylus), Oedipus the King (by Sophocles), Medea (by Euripides) and The Frogs (by Aristophanes). Sukla's translations of the plays have been staged in various colleges and universities of Odisha. Besides, his two historical plays on Odia freedom fighters [[Chakhi Khuntia]] and Jayee Rajguru have also been widely staged. \nThough there is no commercially viable modern Odia theater, there are amateur theater groups and drama competitions. Operas, on the other hand, are commercially successful.\n\n==Popular science fiction writers from Odisha==\nSome popular science fiction writers include Prof [[Prana Krushna Parija]], Padmashree Binod Kanungo, Prof [[Gokulananda Mohapatra]], Prof Gadadhar Mishra, Prof Kulamani Samal, Sarat Kumar Mohanty, Prof Amulya Kumar Panda, [[Dr. Nikhilanand Panigrahy]], Dr. Debakanta Mishra, [[Dr.Ramesh Chandra Parida]], Sashibhusan Rath, Dr. Chitta Ranjan Mishra, Dr. Nityananada Swain, Dr. Choudhury Satybrata Nanda, [[Er. Mayadhar Swain]], [[Kamalakanta Jena]], Himansu Sekhar Fatesingh and [[Bibhuprasad Mohapatra]].\n\n[[Dr. Nikhilanand Panigrahy]]'s \"Sampratikatara Anuchintare Bigyan O Baigyanik\" is a popular book among avid readers. Sashibhusan Rath's ''Vigyan Chinta'' and [[Kamalakanta Jena]]'s ''Gapare Gapare Bigyan'' (Awarded by Odisha Bigyan Academy 2011) are written for children as well as adults.\n\n==In the United States of America==\nA large initiative, Pratishruti, was started to connect literary minded people in North America with their Indian peers. The goal is to expose Indian-Americans to the best writings of outstanding Odia writers as well as to cultivate new writers in America.\n\nBlack Eagle Books, a non-profit publishing initiative was started in April 2019 to propagate Odia literature globally through book publication and translation projects.\n\nTo encourage new writers, Black Eagle Books started \"Black Eagle Books First Book Award\" and award for 2019 was given to Niharika Mallick for her translation anthology of contemporary Hindi short stories in Odia, Adhunika Hindi Galpamala.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[John Beames]]\n* [[Laxmi Puran]]\n* [[Madala Panji]]\n* [[Rebati]]\n* ''[[Six Acres and a Third]]''\n* [[Utkala Bhramanam]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* Mansingha, Mayadhar (1962) ''History of Oriya literature'' Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi\n* Sahoo, Krushna Charan (2004) ''Oriya Lekhaka Paricaya'' Orissa Sahitya Academy, Bhubaneswar, {{ISBN|81-7586-097-9}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7586-097-1}}\n* Myers, Carol Fairbanks (1976) ''Women in Literature: Criticism of the Seventies'' Scarecrow Press, Inc.

The language is also spoken by minority populations of the neighbouring states of [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. The region has been known at different stages of history as [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Odra Desha|Udra]], [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] or [[Western Odisha|Hirakhanda]]. Odisha was a vast empire in [[ancient]] and [[medieval]] times, extending from the [[Ganges]] in the north to the [[Godavari]] in the south. During [[British rule]], however, Odisha lost its political identity and formed parts of the Bengal and Madras Presidencies. The present state of Odisha was formed in 1936. The modern Odia language is formed mostly from [[Pali]] words with significant Sanskrit influence. About 28% of modern Odia words have [[Adivasi]] origins, and about 2% have Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu), Persian, or Arabic origins. The earliest written texts in the language are about thousand years old. The first Odia newspaper was [[Utkala Deepika]] first published on 4 August 1866.\n\n[[Odia language|Odia]] is the only Indo-European language of India other than [[Sanskrit]] and the sixth Indian language that has been conferred [[classical language]] status and forms the basis of [[Odissi dance]] and [[Odissi music]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Odia gets classical language status|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odia-gets-classical-language-status/article5709028.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 20 February 2014|access-date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Odia becomes sixth classical language|url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140221/jsp/frontpage/story_18004148.jsp#.VjZc7rcrLIU|website = The Telegraph|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = ODISSI \u2013 A DISTINCT STYLE OF INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC|url = http://chandrakantha.com/misra/odissi.html|website = chandrakantha.com|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have divided the history of the Odia language literature into five main stages: Old Odia (800 AD to 1300 AD), Early Medieval Odia (1300 AD to 1500 AD), Medieval Odia (1500 AD to 1700 AD), Late Medieval Odia (1700 AD to 1850 AD) and Modern Odia (1850 AD to present). Further subdivisions, as seen below, can more accurately chart the language's development.\n\n== First literature of Odisha (4th century BC)==\nThe ancientness of the Odia literature is being proved from its soil which says about two types of literature from very beginning. The creativity, development and preservation of Odia language and literature through ages can be seen in its spoken (in the form of folk lores) and written forms (e.g. rock edicts, manuscripts). The songs sung after birth, death, while working, and during festivals have helped to preserve the language in the first way (i.e. spoken form) by getting transferred through generations, while, the stories painted in cave paintings have constituted preservation in the second way (i.e. written form). The inhabitants of this land started to drown this language about 15,000 years ago. The Gudahandi painting of Kalahandi district and the cave art of [[Khandagiri]] and [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri]] are the great achievements of this primitive architecture.\n\n[[Kharavela]]'s [[Hathigumpha inscription|Hatigumpha inscription]] serves as evidence of past Odia cultural, political, ritual, and social status and is the 1st poetic stake inscription. Though Ashoka had created many rock edicts and inscriptions before [[Kharavela]], yet his instructions for administration have been written in a rude and chocked language. On the other hand, the [[Hathigumpha inscription|Hatigumpha inscription]] shows the flexibility of the language in a sweet flow.\n\nMain feature of this inscription was based on principles of Sanskrit poetic structure: such as-\n\n{{Quote|Sadvanshah kshyatriya b\u00e2 pi dhiirod\u00e2ttah gunanwit\u00e2h I<br>\nEkabanshodva bhup\u00e2h\u00e2 kulaj\u00e2 bahabo pi J\u00e2 II<br>\nShrungarabirashant\u00e2n\u00e2mekoangirasa ishyate I<br>\nAng\u00e2ni sarbe<pi ras\u00e2ha sarbe n\u00e2takasandhy\u00e2h\u00e2 II<br>\nItih\u00e2sodvabam bruttam\u00e2n\u00e2nyad b\u00e2 sajjan\u00e2shrayam I<br>\nChatwarastasya bargah\u00e2 syusteshwekam cha phalam bhavet II<br>\nA\u00e2dyu namaskriyashrib\u00e2 bastunirddesha eba b\u00e2 I<br>\nKwacinnind\u00e2 khal\u00e2din\u00e2m sat\u00e2m cha gunakirttinam II<br>\n(S\u00e2hitya darpan-  Biswan\u00e2th kabir\u00e2j)}}\n\nIt means that such creations will be called as poem which Protagonist would be Dhirodatta belonging to an untouchable kshtriya. In Rasa (aesthetics) Srunag\u00e2ra (Love, Attractiveness), V\u00eera (Heroic mood), S\u00e2nta (Peace or tranquility) among them one would be the main rasa and others are remain with them as usual. All aspects of drama, historic tales and other legendary folklores are present. The description of all the fourfold-Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokshya are still present here, but one should be given priority than other theme. At the beginning it should be written as respective, blissful and subject aware with welfare of people being hatred towards evil and devotional towards sages/saints.\n\nWhen [[Hathigumpha inscription|Hatigumpha Inscription]] was created by [[Kharavela]], all these principles were traced by him before, which has been followed by [[Rudradaman]] (Girinar inscription 150 AD), [[Samudragupta]] (Prayaga inscription 365 AD), Kumargupta (Mandasore inscription 473 AD), created their own famous creativities in a decent poetic style on many rocks in the Sanskrit language. The trend of writing was not obstructed after Kharavela. From Asanapata inscription in Keonjhar created by [[Satrubhanja|Satru Bhanja]], (a warrior of Odisha) were engraved in the temple, Laxminarayana of Simhanchalam by Mukunda Deva are such examples. In the beginning, these inscriptions had a dynamic journey from Pali to Sanskrit. They have not lost the sense of Odia. Therefore, Odia language, literature, script and culture are based on the discussions on these inscriptions. The words written in the Hatigumpha Inscription are still used in the present day Odia language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prusty|first1=Subrat Kumar|last2=Pattanayak|first2=Debi Prasanna|title=Classical Odia in Historical Perspective|date=2015|publisher=Odisha Sahitya Akademi|location=Bhubaneswar|isbn=9788175861985|page=94|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Age of Charya literature (7th to 8th centuries AD)==\nThe beginnings of Odia poetry coincide with the development of [[Charyapada]] or [[Caryagiti]], a literature started by [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] poets.<ref name=\"Mukherjee \">Mukherjee, Prabhat. ''The History of medieval Vaishnavism in Odisha''. Chapter: ''The Sidhacharyas in Odisha'' Page 55.</ref> This literature was written with a certain metaphor called \"Sandhya Bhasha\", and some of its poets like Luipa and Kanhupa came from the same territory as present day Odisha. The language of Charya was considered to be [[Prakrit]].  In one of his poem, Kanhupa wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Your hut stands outside the city<br>Oh, untouchable maid<br>The bald Brahmin passes sneaking close by<br>Oh, my maid, I would make you my companion<br>Kanha is a kapali, a yogi<br>He is naked and has no disgust<br>There is a lotus with sixty-four petals<br>Upon that the maid will climb with this poor self and dance.}}\n\nIn this poem [[shakti]] is replaced by the image of the \"untouchable maid\". The description of its location outside the city corresponds to being outside the ordinary consciousness. Although she is untouchable the bald Brahmin, or in other words so-called wise man, has a secret hankering for her. But only a ''kapali'' or an extreme tantric can be a fit companion for her, because he is also an outcast. The kapali is naked because he does not have any social identity or artifice. After the union with the shakti, the shakti and the kapali will climb on the 64-petalled lotus [[Sahasrara]] [[chakra]] and dance there.\n\nThis poet used images and symbols from the existing social milieu or collective psychology so that the idea of a deep realization could be easily grasped by the readers. This kind of poetry, full of the mystery of tantra, spread throughout the northeastern part of India from the 10th to the 14th centuries, and its style of expression was revived by the Odia poets of the 16th to the 19th centuries.\n\n== Pre-Sarala Age (12th to 14th centuries AD) ==\nIn the pre-Sarala period, Natha and Siddha literature flourished in Odisha.

Sarala Das was given the title Shudramuni, or seer from a backward class. He had no formal education and did not know Sanskrit.\n\nThis translation has since provided subsequent poets with the necessary foundation for a national literature, providing a fairly accurate idea of the Odia culture at the time. Sarala Dasa, born in the 15th century Odisha of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] emperor [[Kapilendradeva|Kapilendra Deva]], was acclaimed as the \"Adikabi\" or first poet. The reign of the Gajapatis is considered as the golden period for Odisha's art and literature. Kapilendra Deva patronized Odia language and literature along with Sanskrit unlike his predecessors who used only Sanskrit as their lingua franca. In fact a short Odia poem ''Kebana Munikumara'' is found in the Sanskrit Drama ''Parashurama Vijaya'' ascribed to none other than the emperor Kapilendra Deva himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsQBAAAAMAAJ|title=Sidelights on History and Culture of Orissa|last1=Das|first1=Manmath Nath|year=1977}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSduAAAAMAAJ|title=The Orissa Historical Research Journal|year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDNuAAAAMAAJ|title=Orissa District Gazetteers: Ganjam|last1=(India)|first1=Orissa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Colonialism and South Asia: Cuttack, 1803\u20131947|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3GzaAAAAMAAJ|publisher = R.N.

The word \"pancha\" means five and the word \"sakha\", friend.\n\nThe Panchasakhas were [[Vaishnavas]] by thought. In 1509, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Shri Chaitanya]] came to Odisha with his Vaishnava message of love. Before him, [[Jaydev]] had prepared the ground for Vaishnavism through his [[Gita Govinda]]. Chaitanya's path of devotion was known as Raganuga Bhakti Marga. He introduced chanting as a way to make spiritual connection & taught the importance of Hare krushna mantra. Unlike Chaitanya, the Panchasakhas believed in Gyana Mishra Bhakti Marga, similar to the Buddhist philosophy of Charya literature stated above.\n\nThe Panchasakhas were significant not only because of their poetry but also for their spiritual legacy. In the holy land of Kalinga (Odisha) several saints, mystics, and devotional souls have been born throughout history, fortifying its culture and spiritualism. The area uniquely includes temples of Shakti, Shiva and Jagann\u00e2tha Vishnu. Several rituals and traditions have been extensively practised here by various seers \u2013 including Buddhist ceremonies, Devi \"Tantra\" ([[Tantra|tantric]] rituals for Shakti), [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] Marg and [[Vaishnava Bhakthi|Vaishnava]] Marg. There is hardly any \"Sadhak\"  who did not pay a visit to the Shri Jagann\u00e2th temple.\n\nThere is an interesting description of the origin of the Panchasakhas, in Achyutananda's ''Shunya Samhita.''  As per his narration, towards the end of Mahabharat when Lord Krishna was leaving his mortal body, Nilakantheswara Mahadeva appeared & revealed to him that the Lord's companions Dama, Sudama, Srivatsa, Subala, and Subahu would reincarnate in the Kali-yuga & be known as Ananta, Acyutananda, Jagannatha, Balarama and Yasovanta, respectively. Thus, believers in the Panchasakha consider them the most intimate friends of Lord Krishna in Dwapara-yuga, who came again in Kali-yuga to serve him. They are also instrumental in performing the crucial & much-awaited Yuga-Karma where they destroy the sinners and save the saints, according to Sanatana-Hindu beliefs.\n\nBalaram Das's J''Agamohan Ramayan'' provided one pillar, along with Sarala-Das's ''Mahabharata'', upon which subsequent Odia literature was built. His ''[[Laxmi Puran|Lakshmi Purana]]'' is considered the first manifesto of women's liberation or feminism in Indian literature. His other major works are ''Gita Abakasa, Bhava samudra, Gupta Gita, Vedanta Sara, Mriguni Stuti, Saptanga yogasara tika, Vedanta sara or Brahma tika, Baula gai gita, Kamala lochana chotisa, Kanta koili, Bedha parikrama, Brahma gita, Brahmanda bhugola, Vajra kavacha, Jnana chudamani, Virata gita, Ganesha vibhuti & Amarakosha Gita.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://puriwaves.nirmalya.in/saints/balarama-das|title=Balarama Das|work=PURIWAVES}}</ref><ref name=\"odisha.gov.in\">http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2014/July/engpdf/69-73.pdf</ref>\n\nThe most influential work of this period was however [[Atibadi Jagannath Das]]'s ''Bhagabata'', which had a great influence on the Odia people as a day-to-day philosophical guide, as well as a lasting one in Odia culture. His other works include ''Gupta Bhagavat, Tula vina, Sola chapadi, Chari chapadi, Tola bena, Daru brahma gita, Diksa samyad, Artha koili, Muguni stuti, Annamaya kundali, Goloka sarodhara, Bhakti chandrika, Kali malika, Indra malika, Niladri vilasa, Nitya gupta chintamani, Sri Krishna bhakti kalpa lata''.<ref name=\"odisha.gov.in\"/>\n\nShishu Ananta Das was born in Balipatana near Bhubaneswar in the late 15th century.

His ''Chatur Binoda'' (Amusement of Intelligent) seems to be the first work that deals with different kinds of rasas, predominantly the bibhatsa rasa, but often verges on nonsense. The style of \"'''''Chitra Kavya'''''\" (mixture of poetry and paintings) was at its best in the 18th century. Several chitra pothis can be traced to this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gurgaon.locanto.in/ID_221205969/Chitra-Pothi-Illustrated-Palm-Leaf-Manuscripts-from.html|title=Chitra Pothi : Illustrated Palm Leaf Manuscripts from ..., Gurgaon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=22wCxbKAdmkC&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=odia+chitra+kabya#v=onepage&q=odia%20chitra%20kabya&f=false|title=The Two-headed Deer}}</ref>\n\n''Bichitra Ramayana'' of [[Biswanaath Khuntia]] is one of the most celebrated works of this period composed in the early 18th century.

After this time books were printed and journals and periodicals became available in Odia. The first Odia magazine, ''Bodha Dayini'' was published in Balasore in 1861. Its goal was to promote Odia literature and draw attention to lapses in government policy.  The first Odia paper ''The [[Utkala Deepika]]'', was first published in 1866 under editor [[Gourishankar Ray]] and Bichitrananda. ''The Utkal Deepika'' campaigned to bring all Odia-speaking areas together under one administration, to develop the Odia language and literature and to protect Odia interests.\n\nIn 1869 Bhagavati Charan Das started another newspaper, ''Utkal Subhakari'', to propagate the Brahmo faith. In the last three and a half decades of the 19th century, a number of newspapers were published in Odia. Prominent papers included ''Utkal Deepika'',''Utkal Patra'', ''Utkal Hiteisini'' from Cuttack, ''Utkal Darpan'' and ''Sambada Vahika'' from Balasore and ''Sambalpur Hiteisini'' from Deogarh. The success of these papers indicated the desire and determination of the people of Odisha to uphold their right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, with the ultimate aim of freedom from British rule. These periodicals performed another vital function, in that they encouraged modern literature and offered a broad reading base for Odia-language writers.  Intellectuals who came into contact with Odia literature through the papers were also influenced by their availability.\n\n[[Kabibar Radhanath Ray|Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908) is the most well-known poet of this period. He wrote with a Western influence, and his kavyas (long poems) included Chandrabhaga, Nandikeshwari, Usha, Mahajatra, Darbar and Chilika.\n\n[[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918), the most known Odia fiction writer, was also of this generation. He was considered the [[Fakir Mohan Senapati|Vyasakabi]] or founding poet of the Odia language. Senapati was born raised in the coastal town of Balasore, and worked as a government administrator. Enraged by the attempts of the [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] to marginalize or replace the [[Odia language]], he took to creative writing late in life. Though he also did translations from Sanskrit, wrote poetry and attempted many forms of literature, he is now known primarily as the father of modern Odia prose fiction. His ''[[Rebati]]'' (1898) is widely recognized as the first Odia short story. ''Rebati''  is the story of a young innocent girl whose desire for education is placed in the context of a conservative society in a backward Odisha village, which is hit by the killer [[cholera]] epidemic. His other stories are \"Patent Medicine\", \"Dak Munshi\", and \"Adharma Bitta\". Senapati is also known for his novel [[Chha Maana Atha Guntha]]. This was the first Indian novel to deal with the exploitation of landless peasants by a feudal lord. It was written well before the [[October revolution]] in Russia and emerging of Marxist ideas in India.\n\nOther eminent Odia writers and poets of the time include [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Madhusudan Rao]], [[Chintamani Mohanty]], [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875-1928) [[Gourishankar Ray]] (1838-1917) and [[Reba Ray]] (1876-1957).\n\n==Age of Satyabadi==\n{{main|Gopabandhu Das}}\nDuring the Age of Radhanath the literary world was divided between the classicists, led by the magazine ''[[The Indradhanu]]'', and the modernists, led by the magazine ''[[Bijuli (Odia magazine)|The Bijuli]]''. [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928) was a great balancer and realized that a nation, as well as its literature, lives by its traditions. He believed that a modern national superstructure could only endure if based on solid historical foundations.  He wrote a satirical poem in ''The Indradhanu'', which led to punishment by the Inspector of Schools, but he refused to apologise.\n\nGopabandhu joined [[Ravenshaw College]] in Cuttack to pursue graduation after this incident. He started the ''Kartavya Bodhini Samiti'' (Duty Awakening Society) in college to encourage his friends to take on social, economic and political problems and become responsible citizens. While leading a team to serve flood victims, Gopabandhu heard that his son was seriously ill. He preferred, however, to save the \"sons of the soil\" rather than his son. His mission was to reform society and develop education in the name of a social service vision. He lost his wife at age twenty-eight, and had already lost all three of his sons by this time. He left his two daughters and his property in the village with his elder brother, rejecting worldly life. For this social service mission he is regarded by Odias as the Utkalmani.\n\nAs freedom movements began, a new era in literary thought emerged influenced by Gandhi and the trend of nationalism. Gopabandhu was a large part of this idealistic movement, founding a school in Satyabadi and influencing many writers of the period.  Other than Gopabandhu himself, other famous writers of the era were Godabarisha Mishra, Nilakantha Dash, Harihara Acharya and Krupasinshu. They are known as 'Panchasakhas' for their similarities with the historical Age of Panchasakhas. Their principle genres were criticism, essays and poetry.\n\n[[Chintamani Das]] is particularly renowned.  Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village near Sakhigopal, he was bestowed with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his invaluable contribution to Odia literature. Some of his well-known literary works are ''Manishi Nilakantha'', ''Bhala Manisa Hua'', ''Usha'', ''Barabati'', ''Byasakabi Fakiramohan'' and ''Kabi Godabarisha''.\n\n== Pragati Yuga ==\nNabajuga Sahitya Sansad formed in 1935 was one of the first progressive literary organizations in India, contemporaneous to other [[Progressive Writers' Movement|progressive writers movements]]. The founders of the Progressive Movement in Odisha were Nabakrushna Choudhury, Bhagabati Panigrahi and Ananta Patnaik. At the inaugural session of Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad, the great freedom fighter Malati Choudhury sang \"Nabeena Jugara Taruna Jagare\" written by Ananta Patnaik. The mouth piece of Nabajuga Sahity Sansad was Adhunika, the First Progressive Literary Magazine in Odia. Adhuinka was conceived, initiated, edited, published and nurtured by Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi and Ananta Patnaik. Many writers of that time wrote in Adhunika.<ref name=\"Pati 2001 p. 86\">{{cite book | last=Pati | first=B. | title=Situating Social History: Orissa, 1800-1997 | publisher=Orient Longman | series=Madras District Gazetteers | year=2001 | isbn=978-81-250-2007-3 | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uJtnQN3KueEC&pg=PA86 | language=fr | access-date=2020-04-10 | page=86}}</ref><ref name=\"George Sahitya Akademi 1992 p. 307\">{{cite book | last=George | first=K.M. | author2=Sahitya Akademi | title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: Surveys and poems | publisher=Sahitya Akademi | series=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology | year=1992 | isbn=978-81-7201-324-0 | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&pg=PA307 | access-date=2020-04-10 | page=307}}</ref>\n\n==Age of Romanticism or Sabuja Yuga==\nInfluenced by the Romantic thoughts of Rabindranath Tagore during the 1930s when progressive Marxist movements dominated Odia Literature, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi (the brother of Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi who founded Marxism in Odisha) formed a group called \"Sabuja Samiti\" with two of his writer friends [[Annada Shankar Ray]] and Baikuntha Patnaik. This was a very short period in Odia literature, later folded into Gandhian and Marxist work. [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]] later wrote his famous novel ''[[Matira Manisha]]'', which was influenced by Gandhism, and Annada Shankar Ray left for Bengali literature.  Mayadhar Mansingh was a renowned poet of that time, but though he was considered a Romantic poet he kept his distance from the influence of Rabindranath.\n\n==''Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha''==\nThe ''Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha'' is a monumental 7-volume work of about 9,500 pages published between 1930 and 1940. It was a result of the vision and dedicated work of [[Gopal Chandra Praharaj]] (1874\u20131945) over nearly three decades. Praharaj not only conceived of and compiled the work, he also raised the finances to print it through public donations, grants and subscriptions and supervised the printing and the sales of the published work.\n\nThe Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is an Odia language dictionary that lists some 185,000 words and their meanings in four languages \u2013 Odia, English, Hindi and Bengali. It includes quotations from wide-ranging classical works illustrating the special usage of various words. It also contains specialised information such as botanical names of local plants, information on astronomy and long articles on various topics of local interest. In addition, there are biographies of personalities connected with Odisha's history and culture.\n\nThe Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is an encyclopedic work touching on various aspects of the Odia language and Odisha region, as well as many topics of general interest. Its author Praharaj was a lawyer by profession and was ridiculed and reviled by many during production itself. Many printed copies were destroyed unbound and unsold. Many copies sat in libraries of the princes who had patronised the work and most of these copies were sold cheaply when the princes met financial ruin. There are few surviving copies, and those that exist are fragile and worm-damaged. The work is regarded by the older generation, but not well known among younger Odias.\n\n==Post Colonial Age==\n\n===Poetry===\nAs the successors of Sachi Routray, the father of modern odia poetry , [[Guruprasad Mohanty]] and [[Bhanuji Rao]] were highly influenced by T.S. Eliot and published a co-authored poetry book ''Nutan Kabita''. Ramakanta Rath later modified Eliot's ideas in his own work. According to Rath : \"After the publication of Kalapurusha Guru Prasad's poetry collection influenced by T.S. Eliot\u2019s ''The Waste Land''] we realized that a sense of alienation is the main ingredient of modern poetry.\" Before independence Odia poetry was mostly written with Sanskritic or \"literary\" idiom, but after independence poets freely used of Western concepts, idioms, images and adaptation of Western myths.[[Ramakanta Rath]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]], [[Soubhagya Kumar Mishra]], [[Rajendra kishore Panda]], [[Pratibha Satpathy]], [[Mamata Dash]], Haraprasad Das are the most famous of these poets. From the mid 60s and into the 70s the prominent poets of Odia were : [[Radha Mohan Gadanayak]], Benudhar Rout, Brajanath Rath, Bangali Nanda, Harihar Mishra, Dipak Mishra, Kamalakant Lenka, Banshidhar Sarangi, Durga Charan Parida, [[Devdas Chhotray]], Saroj Ranjan Mohanty, Amaresh Patnaik, Ashutosh Parida, [[Prasanna Kumar Patasani|Prasanna Patsani]], [[Hussain Rabi Gandhi]], Sadasiba Dash. \n\nOther poets of this time are : Hrishkesh Mullick, Satrughna Pandab, Prabasini Mahakuda, Aaparna Mohanty, Aswini Mishra, Roninikant Mukherjee, Girija Baliarsingh , Dr.Goutam Jena(''Ranga Siuli'',''Bahuda Bela'') and Ramesh Pati . The early 80s saw in Odia literature a group of poets with new thoughts and styles who overshadowed the earlier generation. These poets had their root in typical Odia soil. The rich heritage and culture with the feelings of commomen were depicted in their Odia poems. They were somehow nearer to the readers as there were little ambiguity in their expression. These contemporary poems were better than the so-called modern poems. The prominent poets of this time included : [[Manasi Pradhan]]. Critics refer to them as the contemporary poet generation.{{who|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Odia Translation of World Classics===\nEminent scholar Prof. [[Ananta Charan Sukla]]'s celebrated Odia Translation (with Commentary, Critical Study and Notes) of Aristotle's Poetics (Aristotle-anka Kabyatatwa) published in the late 1960s is a rare and outstanding work. It is the second translation of the classic work in any Indian language after Bengali. His translation of four classic Greek plays is also a commendable work.\n\n===Fiction===\n\n====Before the 1970s====\nIn the post-independence era Odia fiction took a new direction. The trend [[Fakir Mohan Senapati|Fakir Mohan]] started developed more after independence, led by [[Gopinath Mohanty]] (1914\u20131991), [[Surendra Mohanty]] and [[Manoj Das]] (1934\u2013 ). These authors pioneered the trend of developing or projecting the \"individual as protagonist\" in Odia fiction. There is some tension between the two Mohantys among critics.  Eminent feminist writer and critic [[Sarojini Sahoo]] believes that it is not Gopinath's story \"Dan\", but rather Surendra Mohanty's \"Ruti O Chandra\" that should be considered the first story of the individualistic approach.<ref>Istahar-92, (26th Volume, 2nd Issue),</ref> The major difference between Surendra and Gopinath is that, where Gopinath is more optimistic, Surendra is nihilistic. This nihilism prepared the ground for the development an existentialist movement in Odia literature.\n\n[[Surendra Mohanty]] is a master of language, theme and concept. Some of his famous short story collections and novels are ''Krushna Chuda'', ''Mahanagarira Rati'', ''Ruti O Chandra'', ''Maralara Mrutyu'', ''Shesha Kabita'', ''Dura Simanta'', ''Oh Calcutta'', ''Kabi-O- Nartaki'', ''Sabuja Patra-O-Dhusara Golap'', ''Nila Shaila'' and ''Andha Diganta''.\n\nIn his fiction [[Gopinath Mohanty]] explores all aspects of Odishan life, both in the plains and in the hills. He uses a unique prose style, lyrical in style, choosing worlds and phrases from the day-to-day speech of ordinary men and women. Gopinath's first novel, ''Mana Gahtra Chasa'', was published in 1940, followed by Dadi Budha (1944), Paraja (1945) and Amrutara Santan (1947). He published 24 novels, 10 collections of short stories, three plays, two biographies, two volumes of critical essays and five books on the languages of Kandh, Gadaba and Saora tribes. He also translated Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (''Yuddh O Shanti'') in three volumes (tr. 1985\u201386) and Togore's ''Jogajog'' (tr. 1965) into Odia.\n\nThe writer [[Kalpanakumari Devi]]'s sequence of novels, in particular, her ''Srushti o pralaya'' (1959), documenting the social change in the country have been lauded.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111231/jsp/odisha/story_14945271.jsp#.Vn8gMRGl2FU|author=Namita Panda|date=31 December 2011|title=Furore over award to Kalpanakumari}}</ref>\n\nStarting his literary career as a communist and later becoming an Aurobindian philosopher, [[Manoj Das]] proved himself as a successful bilingual writer in Odia and English. His major Odia works are: ''Shesha Basantara Chithi'' (1966), ''Manoj Dasanka Katha O Kahani'' (1971), ''Dhumabha Diganta'' (1971), ''Manojpancabimsati'' (1977) and ''Tuma Gam O Anyanya Kabita'' (1992). Notable English works include ''The crocodile's lady : a collection of stories'' (1975), ''The submerged valley and other stories'', ''Farewell to a ghost : short stories and a novelette'' (1994), ''Cyclones'' (1987) and ''A tiger at twilight'' (1991).\n\nRenowned writer Ananta Charan Sukla's short story collection, \"Sulataku Sesa Chitthi\" (Last Letter to Sulata) published in 1965 is also worth mentioning. The ten stories included in this book are \"Sulataku Sesa Chitthi\", \"Kapilas\", \"Janeika Kulapati-nka Mrutyu\", \"Tandril Ru Tornoto\", \"Mystic Realistic\", \"Prasanta Samudra: Asanta Lahari\", \"Nalakula Matha, Nepala Babu O Narana\", \"Daudana Bada Khara\", \"Duragata\" and \"Sandipani-ra Symphony\". Other significant pre-1970s fiction writers are Chandrasekhar Rath, [[Santanu Kumar Acharya|Shantanu Kumar Acharya]], [[Mohapatra Nilamani Sahoo]], Akhil Mohan Patnaik, Gobind Das, Rabi Patnaik and [[Jagannath Prasad Das]]. Chandra Sekhar Rath's novel ''Jantrarudha'' is one of the renowned classics of this period. Shantanu Acharya's novel Nara-Kinnara was also influential.\n\n====After the 1970s====\n\nThe trends started by the 1950s and 1960s were challenged by the young writers in the 1970s. This challenge began in the 1960s with a small magazine ''Uan Neo Lu'' in Cuttack. The title of the magazine was made up of three of the Odia alphabets, which were not in use. Writers associated with the magazines included Annada Prasad Ray, Guru Mohanty (not to be confused with Guru Prasad), Kailash Lenka and Akshyay Mohanty. These writers were not as famous as some contemporaries, but they began a revolution in Odia fiction. They tried to break the monopoly of established writers, introducing sexuality in their work and creating a new prose style. In the late 1960s the Cuttack's in Odia Literature was broken when many \"groups\" of writers emerged from different parts of Odisha. Anamas from Puri, Abadhutas from Balugaon, Panchamukhi from Balangir, Abujha from Berhampur and Akshara group from Sambalpur created a sensation in Odia literary scene.\n\nThe changes that started in the 1960s were confirmed in the next decade. Jagadish Mohanty, Kanheilal Das, Satya Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Tarun Kanti Mishra, Padmaja Pal, [[Yashodhara Mishra]] and Sarojini Sahoo created a new era in Odia fiction. Kanheilal Das and Jagadish Mohanty began creating a new style and language popular among a general audience as well as intellectuals. Kanheilal Das died young and is still considered a great loss for Odia fictions. [[Jagadish Mohanty]] introduced [[existentialism]] to Odia literature. His renowned works include ''Ekaki Ashwarohi'', ''Dakshina Duari Ghara'', ''Album'', ''Dipahara Dekhinathiba Lokotie'', ''Nian O Anyanya Galpo'', ''Mephestophelesera Pruthibi'', ''Nija Nija Panipatha'', ''Kanishka Kanishka, Uttaradhikar'' and ''Adrushya Sakal''.\n\nRamchandra Behera is known for short story collections ''Dwitiya Shmashana'', ''Abashishta Ayusha'', ''Omkara Dhwani'', ''Bhagnangshara Swapna'' and ''Achinha Pruthibi''.  Padmaj Pal is also known for short story collections including ''Eaglera Nakha Danta'', ''Sabuthu Sundar Pakshi'', ''Jibanamaya'' and ''Uttara Purusha''. Tarun Kanti Mishra emerged during 1970s as a powerful storyteller with an elegant style, full of poise and vigor. His outstanding works include 'Sharadah Shatam' ( A Thousand Autumns), \u2013 a novel dealing with resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh\u2014and anthologies of short stories such as 'Komal Gandhar', 'Bitansa', 'Bhaswati' and 'Akash Setu'.\n\nSarojini Sahoo, another prominent writer, later famous as a feminist writer, also significantly contributed to Odia fiction. Her novel ''Gambhiri Ghara'' is not only a landmark Odia novel but has also gained international fame for its feminist and liberal ideas. Her other works include ''Amrutara Pratikshare'', ''Chowkatha'', ''Upanibesh'', ''Pratibandi'', ''Paksibasa'', ''Tarlijauthiba Durga'', ''Dukha Apramita'', ''Gambhiri Ghara'' and ''Mahajatra''. Kanaklata Hati, another women fiction writer in whose writing we will find psychoanalysis of female mind. To date she has published two-story collections- 'Nirbak Pahada' & 'Kuhudi Ghara'. She has some translated story collections like 'Galpa Galpantara' and'Praibeshi Galpa'.\n\n====Popular fiction writings====\nA popular Odia literature also emerged in the 1970s, read by rural populace especially women. The best selling writers are Bhagirathi Das, Kanduri Das, Bhagwana Das, [[Bibhuti Patnaik]] and [[Pratibha Ray]].  Some of their works were made into films in the Odia language. In recent times Rabi Kaunungo, [[Tarun Kanti Mishra]], Ajay Swain, Mrinal Chatterjee, Radhu Mishra, Dr Laxmikant Tripathy, Nisith Bose, Suniti Mund, Anjan Chand and Dr. Kulangara have contributed to popular writing.\n\n====Women's writings and feminism====\nThe founding of a women's magazine called ''Sucharita'' in 1975 by [[Sakuntala Panda]] had a significant impact in helping female writers find a voice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some of those writers are Giribala Mohanty, Jayanti Rath, [[Susmita Bagchi]]. [[Paramita Satpathy]], [[Hiranmayee Mishra]], [[Chirashree Indra Singh]], [[Sairindhree Sahoo]], [[Supriya Panda]], [[Gayatri Saraf]], [[Suniti Mund]] and [[Mamatamayi Chowdhry]]. [[Giribala Mohanty (Odia Writer)|Giribala Mohanty]] (1947\u2013) needs a special introduction for her deep sensitiveness for women's issues. Her poems depict the emotional binary of social apathy and the self-confidence of women. Her collections of Poems 'Streeloka' (Women), 'Kalijhia' (The Dark complexion Girl),'Ma Habara Dukha' (The sorrow of being a mother) and 'Kati Katia Katyayani' expresses her feelings in a lucid and lyrical way. [[Sarojini Sahoo]] had a significant influence on these women, paving the way with a feminist approach to fiction and the introduction of sexuality in her work.  She is known as the [[Simone de Beauvoir]] of India, though theoretically she denies the Hegelian theory of \"[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]\" developed by de Beauvoir in her ''[[The Second Sex]]''. Unlike de Beauvoir, Sahoo claims that women are an \"Other\" from the masculine perspective, but that they are entitled to equal human rights according to [[Plato]]. Suniti Mund's Story Book 'Anustupa', Poetry Book 'Jhia' And Novel 'Abhisapta', 'Agarbatira Ghara', 'Matrimony dot com','Gigolo' is also a feminist voice.\n\n==Drama==\nThe traditional Odia theater is the folk opera, or Jatra, which flourishes in the rural areas of Odisha. Modern theater is no longer commercially viable, but in the 1960 experimental theatre made a mark through the works of [[Manoranjan Das]], who pioneered a new theater movement with his brand of experimentalism. Bijay Mishra, Biswajit Das, Kartik Rath, Ramesh Prasad Panigrahi, Ratnakar Chaini, Prasanna Das, Pramod Kumar Tripathy, Sankar Tripathy, Ranjit Patnaik, Dr. Pradip Bhowmic, Hemendra Mahapatra, and Purna Chandra Mallick continued the tradition. Tripathy's contribution to the growth and development of the immensely popular and thought-provoking ''lok natakas'' is universally recognised and he is often called the Rousseau of lok natakas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Noted writer [[Ananta Charan Sukla]]'s Odia translation of four classic Greek dramas is a rare contribution to Odia drama literature. His book, \"Greek Drama\", published in 1974, has translations (with commentary) of Prometheus Bound (by Aeschylus), Oedipus the King (by Sophocles), Medea (by Euripides) and The Frogs (by Aristophanes). Sukla's translations of the plays have been staged in various colleges and universities of Odisha. Besides, his two historical plays on Odia freedom fighters [[Chakhi Khuntia]] and Jayee Rajguru have also been widely staged. \nThough there is no commercially viable modern Odia theater, there are amateur theater groups and drama competitions. Operas, on the other hand, are commercially successful.\n\n==Popular science fiction writers from Odisha==\nSome popular science fiction writers include Prof [[Prana Krushna Parija]], Padmashree Binod Kanungo, Prof [[Gokulananda Mohapatra]], Prof Gadadhar Mishra, Prof Kulamani Samal, Sarat Kumar Mohanty, Prof Amulya Kumar Panda, [[Dr. Nikhilanand Panigrahy]], Dr. Debakanta Mishra, [[Dr.Ramesh Chandra Parida]], Sashibhusan Rath, Dr. Chitta Ranjan Mishra, Dr. Nityananada Swain, Dr. Choudhury Satybrata Nanda, [[Er. Mayadhar Swain]], [[Kamalakanta Jena]], Himansu Sekhar Fatesingh and [[Bibhuprasad Mohapatra]].\n\n[[Dr. Nikhilanand Panigrahy]]'s \"Sampratikatara Anuchintare Bigyan O Baigyanik\" is a popular book among avid readers. Sashibhusan Rath's ''Vigyan Chinta'' and [[Kamalakanta Jena]]'s ''Gapare Gapare Bigyan'' (Awarded by Odisha Bigyan Academy 2011) are written for children as well as adults.\n\n==In the United States of America==\nA large initiative, Pratishruti, was started to connect literary minded people in North America with their Indian peers. The goal is to expose Indian-Americans to the best writings of outstanding Odia writers as well as to cultivate new writers in America.\n\nBlack Eagle Books, a non-profit publishing initiative was started in April 2019 to propagate Odia literature globally through book publication and translation projects. \n\nTo encourage new writers, Black Eagle Books started \"Black Eagle Books First Book Award\" and award for 2019 was given to Niharika Mallick for her translation anthology of contemporary Hindi short stories in Odia, Adhunika Hindi Galpamala.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[John Beames]]\n* [[Laxmi Puran]]\n* [[Madala Panji]]\n* [[Rebati]]\n* ''[[Six Acres and a Third]]''\n* [[Utkala Bhramanam]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* Mansingha, Mayadhar (1962) ''History of Oriya literature'' Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi\n* Sahoo, Krushna Charan (2004) ''Oriya Lekhaka Paricaya'' Orissa Sahitya Academy, Bhubaneswar, {{ISBN|81-7586-097-9}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7586-097-1}}\n* Myers, Carol Fairbanks (1976) ''Women in Literature: Criticism of the Seventies'' Scarecrow Press, Inc.
