Zook operated out of [[Chicago]], working with his nephew D. Coder Taylor, whom he considered his protege. Coder Taylor began working for his uncle in 1935 and recalled that they took any work they could get. Taylor described his uncle as \"a good salesman\" describing how he got the commission for the St. Charles Municipal Building. He described it as \"a big project for the Zook office\" and that the office staff at that time was \"Zook, Taylor, sometimes another draftsman, and a lady secretary.\"<ref name=\"letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/ref/collection/stc/id/12618|title=Letter from Coder Taylor|publisher=Illinois Digital Archives}}</ref>\n\nZook made a preliminary drawing, a proposed elevation, and that was as far as he went.

Baker's niece Dellora and her husband Les Norris, who also shared in the inheritance, donated the land along the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] and Baker donated the building. He said that Baker wanted marble, [[Creole marble|Georgia marble]] because it is a hard marble and he'd had the St. Charles National Bank built, done of [[Etowah marble|pink Georgia marble]]. In its design and construction, both Col. Baker and Coder Taylor wanted the building to last, to stand through time and to age gracefully.

He wanted to build a building and donate it to them after it was completed. We had to do a little research, just what do you have in a city hall? What he wanted was the municipal offices in the building, but with a wing to the side for an industrial museum. That's what it was intended to be. However, it wasn't really industry, it was principally historical...

The game was released on [[GOG.com]] along with its two expansion packs on April 22, 2010, utilizing the [[DOSBox]] emulator to run on modern systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/new_release_one_unit_whole_blood |title=New Release: One Unit Whole Blood|publisher=GOG.com}}</ref> It was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on July 14, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/299030/|title=Blood: One Unit Whole Blood |publisher=Steam}}</ref> The game also served as a principal inspiration for the [[manhwa]] ''[[Priest (manhwa)|Priest]]''.<ref>[http://mudmosh.com/getting-to-know-priest-manhwa-artist-min-woo-hyung/ Getting to Know \u201cPriest:\u201d Manhwa Artist Min-Woo Hyung | Mud Mosh (July 21, 2011)]</ref> A remaster of the game made to run better on modern systems entitled ''Blood: Fresh Supply'' was released on May 9, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/game/blood_fresh_supply|title=Blood: Fresh Supply on GOG.com|website=www.gog.com|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1010750/Blood_Fresh_Supply/|title=Blood: Fresh Supply\u2122 on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn [[single player]] mode, the player takes the role of Caleb in his quest for revenge against his former master by navigating levels in episodes, looking for an exit, until the [[boss (video games)|boss]] level.\n\n''Blood''{{'}}s gameplay is similar to other classic FPS games like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]:'' the player must activate switches or seek keys to go through the levels; some larger maps contain up to six different keys. Features include teleporters, traps such as crushing blocks, explosive barrels, lava pits, [[jumping puzzle]]s, and [[combination lock]] doors.\n\n''Blood'' is one of the earliest FPS games to feature alternate or secondary attack modes for its weapons. Weapons include a [[flare gun]], [[Voodoo doll]], and an aerosol canister that can be used as a flamethrower.<ref name=EGM91>{{cite magazine |title=Blood |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1997 |page=52}}</ref> It also features a power-up known as \"Guns Akimbo\", which allows the player to [[dual wield]] certain weapons temporarily. ''Blood'' also has \"super secret\" areas which contain rewards for discovering them.\n\nEnemies include human members of the Cabal and creatures fighting for the dark god [[Tchernobog]]. Enemies can use objects in the environment for cover.<ref name=EGM91/> The game also features a lesser class of enemies (bats, rats, eels, possessed hands, etc.) often referred to as \"nuisance enemies\" that are not considered threats individually, but can be deadly in large numbers.\n\n''Blood'', like many FPS games of the time, features [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes. When it was released, Internet play was not well established, so ''Blood'' used [[modem]], [[LAN]], or [[serial cable]] connections for multiplayer. Modem and serial cable connections only allow two player games, while an [[IPX]] network connection can support up to eight players. This can easily be achieved on a variety of platforms that support DOSBox and its IPX modes, coupled with [[VPN]] software such as [[Hamachi (software)|Hamachi]]. [[Online multiplayer]] was also possible via the [[Total Entertainment Network]] and [[DWANGO]].<ref name=UGO>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/history-of-online-gaming-1993-1994|title=History of Online Gaming - 1993-1994: DOOM and DWANGO|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=January 16, 2013|publisher=UGO|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014095704/http://www.ugo.com/games/history-of-online-gaming-1993-1994|archivedate=October 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe multiplayer modes consist of [[deathmatch]], known in ''Blood'' as \"Bloodbath\", and cooperative play. Bloodbath matches can be played on specifically designed multiplayer maps or on the levels of the various episodes; the \"frag limit\" or \"time limit\" options are available to end matches, as well as the possibility to control respawn mode for weapons and power-ups. A feature of Bloodbath is \"The Voice\", an audio comment heard upon each frag, that punctuates the death of an opponent often in gory and irreverent terms. \"The Voice\" is that of [[Jace Hall]], who was [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Monolith Productions]] at the time. Cooperative gameplay follows the lines of the single player campaign, allowing several players to work together in the levels of the different episodes.\n\n==Plot==\n''Blood'' takes place in an unspecified time period. The various levels contain elements from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, in addition to futuristic and [[retro-futuristic]] technologies and a [[weird West]] theme. Many elements are [[anachronistic]], including weapons and pop-culture references. The sequel, ''[[Blood II: The Chosen]]'', retroactively dates the game to the year 1928.\n\nThe backstory is not delineated in the game itself, only on the Monolith website and a [[readme]] text document. The player takes on the role of Caleb, once the supreme commander of a [[cult]] called \"The Cabal\", worshipers of the forgotten god [[Tchernobog]].<ref name=\"Chalk2018\">{{cite news |last1=Chalk |first1=Andy |title=1997 horror shooter Blood is coming back |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/au/1997-horror-shooter-blood-is-coming-back/ |accessdate=22 September 2019 |work=PC Gamer |date=7 December 2018}}</ref> Known as a merciless [[gunfighter]] in [[Old West|the late 19th century American West]], Caleb joined the Cabal in 1871 after meeting Ophelia Price, a woman whose husband and son may have been murdered by the members of the Cabal; it is implied that she later became Caleb's lover. Together they rose to the highest circle of the dark cult, \"The Chosen\", until all four members of The Chosen were betrayed and killed by Tchernobog for unspecified failures. Several years later, Caleb rises from his grave, seeking answers and vengeance.<ref name= Chalk2018 />\n\nIn search of Tchernobog's minion, the [[gargoyle]] Cheogh, Caleb moves to the [[rail yard]] and station, where he boards the northbound \"Phantom Express\". He fights off the undead which swarm the train, finally stopping the train by blowing up the locomotive. Emerging from the wreckage, cutting through swarms of Cabal loyalists and other creatures, Caleb enters the \"Great Temple\". A teleporter in the temple leads Caleb to Cheogh's altar, where he fights and slays the creature. Caleb finishes by lighting up Ophelia's funeral pyre to cremate her body.\n\n[[File:Blood game screenshot.png|thumb|The player confronts Cerberus (left) and Tchernobog]]\nCaleb heads to the Arctic north on a large icebound wooden sailing ship. He disembarks at a lumber mill the Cabal has transformed into a crude human remains processing area. He makes his way into a [[Mining|mine]] in search of Shial's lair. Navigating the Cabal infested tunnels, Caleb finds a dark stony cavern where he defeats Shial, crushing her with a stomp of his boot. He then rips out and consumes the heart of the webbed corpse of Gabriel, another of the betrayed Chosen, thus gaining the power of his fallen comrade.\n\n[[Cerberus]] is promoted to Tchernobog's second in command. Caleb moves across an industrial facility, entering a nearby [[dam]] control installation located near Cerberus' cavern, then blows up the dam with explosives. The resulting flood makes Cerberus' hideout accessible. Caleb fills Cerberus' stomach with bundles of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and blows up the corpse.\n\nCaleb heads for the \"Hall of the Epiphany\" where Tchernobog is waiting. There, before facing him, Caleb learns why \"The Chosen\" were cast down: Tchernobog knew Caleb would return to him, killing anyone he ran into to take his revenge and thus gaining immense power, something Tchernobog wants for himself. Caleb battles and destroys the dark god. One of Tchernobog's worshipers approaches Caleb and declares him their new god. Caleb shoots him and leaves the Hall of Epiphany.\n\n==Expansion packs==\nThe first episode of ''Blood'' was released as [[shareware]]. The full retail version of ''Blood'' was released on a CD-ROM, featuring all four original episodes and all of the elements that were missing in the shareware version. The extremely violent content of the game later prompted the release of a censored version of ''Blood'' with toned-down violence. Two official [[expansion pack|expansions]] were released for the game. ''Cryptic Passage'' was developed by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and features a new 10 level episode for single player and four new multiplayer levels. Monolith's official add-on for ''Blood'' is called the ''Plasma Pak'' and contains 11 new levels, new enemies, and weapons modes. A special edition collection titled ''One Unit Whole Blood'' was released on July 15, 1998, including the fully patched versions of ''Blood'', ''Cryptic Passage'', and the ''Plasma Pak'', as well as the ''Blood: Unlock the Secrets'' guide in a single package. Strategy guides for the game were also published, namely ''Blood: The Official Strategy Guide'' and ''Blood: Unlock the Secrets''.\n\n===Cryptic Passage===\n''Cryptic Passage'' was published by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and is the only officially authorized commercially available add-on for ''Blood'' that was not created by Monolith. It was released on June 30, 1997, and contains 10 new single player levels and four new multiplayer Bloodbath levels.\n\nIn the episode's new story, having heard news of an ancient scroll, Caleb sets out to retrieve it for his own dark needs.\n\n===Plasma Pak===\nReleased in September 1997, the ''Plasma Pak'' expansion adds several new features to ''Blood''; a new episode with nine single player levels titled \"Post Mortem\" is included, along with two new multiplayer Bloodbath levels, one of which was modeled after Monolith's corporate offices, for a total of 11 levels. New enemies are included in the ''Plasma Pak'', and all of them are featured in the extra episode; the new creatures include two new Cabal loyalist types, Chrysallid pods, miniature Calebs, and a new boss, the Beast. There are no new weapons added to Caleb's arsenal, though some new weapon abilities are introduced; the Tesla Cannon can now be wielded [[Dual wield|akimbo]] (provided the appropriate power-up is collected), while the Napalm Cannon and Life Leech have new secondary attacks. The ''Plasma Pak'' also integrated a large number of bug fixes which had been previously addressed by several patches.<ref name=\"plasmapak\" />\n\n====Episode 6: Post Mortem====\nAfter Caleb learns the Cabal is training replacements for the fallen Chosen, he sets out to stop the cult's plans. Caleb moves into Cabal territory, wreaking havoc in a temple complex, then storming the inner temple. Satisfied the temples have been dealt with, Caleb enters the training ground for \"The Chosen\". In order to rest, Caleb destroys each of the four \"Chosen\" in training and the Beasts within them.\n\n==Development==\n{{See also|Build engine}}\n\nDevelopment began at Q Studios, an independent developer funded by [[3D Realms]], in parallel with a number of other well-known titles. Following the success of ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', development progress was made public starting in June 1996 with weekly updates on their website. It was originally scheduled for release in early 1997. Q Studios was acquired by [[Monolith Productions|Monolith]] in November 1996. On January 22, 1997, a press release announced that all rights had been sold to [[Monolith Productions|Monolith]]<ref name=\"soldtomonolith\">[http://legacy.3drealms.com/press/bloodsale.html], Rights to ''Blood'' sold To Monolith</ref> so that [[3D Realms]] could focus efforts on ''[[Shadow Warrior]]'', another [[Build engine]] game slated for release the same year.\n\n''Blood'' was one of two games (the other being ''Shadow Warrior'') that took advantage of the Build engine's support for [[voxel]] objects in the game world. ''Blood'' used this for weapon and ammo pickups, power-ups, and occasionally decorations, such as the [[tombstone]]s in the first level of episode one, \"Cradle to Grave\".\n\nThe Build engine was enhanced for ''Blood'' to allow new lighting effects, real-time shadows, and simulated \"rooms above rooms\".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Blood |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1997|page=62}}</ref>\n\nA central feature of ''Blood'' is an abundant (and often exaggerated) [[graphic violence]], from which the game derives its name. Enemies can be blown to pieces, and the pieces often rain down on the player. Zombies' heads can be shot off and then kicked around like footballs, spewing fountains of blood. Enemies scream if set on fire or are otherwise injured, making sound an integral part of the violent atmosphere of ''Blood''. The levels themselves are designed with the same spirit, as corpses, torture victims, and several grotesque situations are witnessed in the game. Collectively, these features caused some public concern about ''Blood'', leading to a censored re-release of the game.\n\nIn December 2018, [[Night Dive Studios]] announced that Atari commissioned them to create an enhanced version of ''Blood'', which was released in May 2019 under the title ''Blood: Fresh Supply''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/7/18129658/blood-reboot-nightdive-atari |title=Blood set to return in remaster of gory '90s shooter |first=Colin |last=Campbell |date=December 7, 2018 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The new version featured compatibility with modern operating systems and native support for monitor resolutions up to 4K, antialiasing, ambient occlusion and interpolation among other improvements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-blood-fresh-supply-553735.phtml|title=Review: Blood: Fresh Supply|website=Destructoid|language=english|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/blood-fresh-supply-pc/|title=Blood: Fresh Supply is the second coming of a classic FPS, and it's out today|last=Park|first=Morgan|date=2019-05-09|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property ownership==\n\n3D Realms sold Monolith the intellectual property (IP) so 3D Realms could make ''Shadow Warrior''. Monolith sold the publishing rights, but not the IP for ''Blood'' and its sequel to GT Interactive. GTI was later acquired by [[Infogrames]], which has since been renamed to [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]]. Monolith itself was acquired by [[Warner Bros.

Cooperative gameplay follows the lines of the single player campaign, allowing several players to work together in the levels of the different episodes.\n\n==Plot==\n''Blood'' takes place in an unspecified time period. The various levels contain elements from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, in addition to futuristic and [[retro-futuristic]] technologies and a [[weird West]] theme. Many elements are [[anachronistic]], including weapons and pop-culture references. The sequel, ''[[Blood II: The Chosen]]'', retroactively dates the game to the year 1928.\n\nThe backstory is not delineated in the game itself, only on the Monolith website and a [[readme]] text document. The player takes on the role of Caleb, once the supreme commander of a [[cult]] called \"The Cabal\", worshipers of the forgotten god [[Tchernobog]].<ref name=\"Chalk2018\">{{cite news |last1=Chalk |first1=Andy |title=1997 horror shooter Blood is coming back |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/au/1997-horror-shooter-blood-is-coming-back/ |accessdate=22 September 2019 |work=PC Gamer |date=7 December 2018}}</ref> Known as a merciless [[gunfighter]] in [[Old West|the late 19th century American West]], Caleb joined the Cabal in 1871 after meeting Ophelia Price, a woman whose husband and son may have been murdered by the members of the Cabal; it is implied that she later became Caleb's lover. Together they rose to the highest circle of the dark cult, \"The Chosen\", until all four members of The Chosen were betrayed and killed by Tchernobog for unspecified failures. Several years later, Caleb rises from his grave, seeking answers and vengeance.<ref name= Chalk2018 />\n\nIn search of Tchernobog's minion, the [[gargoyle]] Cheogh, Caleb moves to the [[rail yard]] and station, where he boards the northbound \"Phantom Express\". He fights off the undead which swarm the train, finally stopping the train by blowing up the locomotive. Emerging from the wreckage, cutting through swarms of Cabal loyalists and other creatures, Caleb enters the \"Great Temple\". A teleporter in the temple leads Caleb to Cheogh's altar, where he fights and slays the creature. Caleb finishes by lighting up Ophelia's funeral pyre to cremate her body.\n\n[[File:Blood game screenshot.png|thumb|The player confronts Cerberus (left) and Tchernobog]]\nCaleb heads to the Arctic north on a large icebound wooden sailing ship. He disembarks at a lumber mill the Cabal has transformed into a crude human remains processing area. He makes his way into a [[Mining|mine]] in search of Shial's lair. Navigating the Cabal infested tunnels, Caleb finds a dark stony cavern where he defeats Shial, crushing her with a stomp of his boot. He then rips out and consumes the heart of the webbed corpse of Gabriel, another of the betrayed Chosen, thus gaining the power of his fallen comrade.\n\n[[Cerberus]] is promoted to Tchernobog's second in command. Caleb moves across an industrial facility, entering a nearby [[dam]] control installation located near Cerberus' cavern, then blows up the dam with explosives. The resulting flood makes Cerberus' hideout accessible. Caleb fills Cerberus' stomach with bundles of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and blows up the corpse.\n\nCaleb heads for the \"Hall of the Epiphany\" where Tchernobog is waiting. There, before facing him, Caleb learns why \"The Chosen\" were cast down: Tchernobog knew Caleb would return to him, killing anyone he ran into to take his revenge and thus gaining immense power, something Tchernobog wants for himself. Caleb battles and destroys the dark god. One of Tchernobog's worshipers approaches Caleb and declares him their new god. Caleb shoots him and leaves the Hall of Epiphany.\n\n==Expansion packs==\nThe first episode of ''Blood'' was released as [[shareware]]. The full retail version of ''Blood'' was released on a CD-ROM, featuring all four original episodes and all of the elements that were missing in the shareware version. The extremely violent content of the game later prompted the release of a censored version of ''Blood'' with toned-down violence. Two official [[expansion pack|expansions]] were released for the game. ''Cryptic Passage'' was developed by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and features a new 10 level episode for single player and four new multiplayer levels. Monolith's official add-on for ''Blood'' is called the ''Plasma Pak'' and contains 11 new levels, new enemies, and weapons modes. A special edition collection titled ''One Unit Whole Blood'' was released on July 15, 1998, including the fully patched versions of ''Blood'', ''Cryptic Passage'', and the ''Plasma Pak'', as well as the ''Blood: Unlock the Secrets'' guide in a single package. Strategy guides for the game were also published, namely ''Blood: The Official Strategy Guide'' and ''Blood: Unlock the Secrets''.\n\n===Cryptic Passage===\n''Cryptic Passage'' was published by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and is the only officially authorized commercially available add-on for ''Blood'' that was not created by Monolith. It was released on June 30, 1997, and contains 10 new single player levels and four new multiplayer Bloodbath levels.\n\nIn the episode's new story, having heard news of an ancient scroll, Caleb sets out to retrieve it for his own dark needs.\n\n===Plasma Pak===\nReleased in September 1997, the ''Plasma Pak'' expansion adds several new features to ''Blood''; a new episode with nine single player levels titled \"Post Mortem\" is included, along with two new multiplayer Bloodbath levels, one of which was modeled after Monolith's corporate offices, for a total of 11 levels. New enemies are included in the ''Plasma Pak'', and all of them are featured in the extra episode; the new creatures include two new Cabal loyalist types, Chrysallid pods, miniature Calebs, and a new boss, the Beast. There are no new weapons added to Caleb's arsenal, though some new weapon abilities are introduced; the Tesla Cannon can now be wielded [[Dual wield|akimbo]] (provided the appropriate power-up is collected), while the Napalm Cannon and Life Leech have new secondary attacks. The ''Plasma Pak'' also integrated a large number of bug fixes which had been previously addressed by several patches.<ref name=\"plasmapak\" />\n\n====Episode 6: Post Mortem====\nAfter Caleb learns the Cabal is training replacements for the fallen Chosen, he sets out to stop the cult's plans. Caleb moves into Cabal territory, wreaking havoc in a temple complex, then storming the inner temple. Satisfied the temples have been dealt with, Caleb enters the training ground for \"The Chosen\". In order to rest, Caleb destroys each of the four \"Chosen\" in training and the Beasts within them.\n\n==Development==\n{{See also|Build engine}}\n\nDevelopment began at Q Studios, an independent developer funded by [[3D Realms]], in parallel with a number of other well-known titles. Following the success of ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', development progress was made public starting in June 1996 with weekly updates on their website. It was originally scheduled for release in early 1997. Q Studios was acquired by [[Monolith Productions|Monolith]] in November 1996. On January 22, 1997, a press release announced that all rights had been sold to [[Monolith Productions|Monolith]]<ref name=\"soldtomonolith\">[http://legacy.3drealms.com/press/bloodsale.html], Rights to ''Blood'' sold To Monolith</ref> so that [[3D Realms]] could focus efforts on ''[[Shadow Warrior]]'', another [[Build engine]] game slated for release the same year.\n\n''Blood'' was one of two games (the other being ''Shadow Warrior'') that took advantage of the Build engine's support for [[voxel]] objects in the game world. ''Blood'' used this for weapon and ammo pickups, power-ups, and occasionally decorations, such as the [[tombstone]]s in the first level of episode one, \"Cradle to Grave\".\n\nThe Build engine was enhanced for ''Blood'' to allow new lighting effects, real-time shadows, and simulated \"rooms above rooms\".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Blood |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1997|page=62}}</ref>\n\nA central feature of ''Blood'' is an abundant (and often exaggerated) [[graphic violence]], from which the game derives its name. Enemies can be blown to pieces, and the pieces often rain down on the player. Zombies' heads can be shot off and then kicked around like footballs, spewing fountains of blood. Enemies scream if set on fire or are otherwise injured, making sound an integral part of the violent atmosphere of ''Blood''. The levels themselves are designed with the same spirit, as corpses, torture victims, and several grotesque situations are witnessed in the game. Collectively, these features caused some public concern about ''Blood'', leading to a censored re-release of the game.\n\nIn December 2018, [[Night Dive Studios]] announced that Atari commissioned them to create an enhanced version of ''Blood'', which was released in May 2019 under the title ''Blood: Fresh Supply''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/7/18129658/blood-reboot-nightdive-atari |title=Blood set to return in remaster of gory '90s shooter |first=Colin |last=Campbell |date=December 7, 2018 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The new version featured compatibility with modern operating systems and native support for monitor resolutions up to 4K, antialiasing, ambient occlusion and interpolation among other improvements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-blood-fresh-supply-553735.phtml|title=Review: Blood: Fresh Supply|website=Destructoid|language=english|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/blood-fresh-supply-pc/|title=Blood: Fresh Supply is the second coming of a classic FPS, and it's out today|last=Park|first=Morgan|date=2019-05-09|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property ownership==\n\n3D Realms sold Monolith the intellectual property (IP) so 3D Realms could make ''Shadow Warrior''. Monolith sold the publishing rights, but not the IP for ''Blood'' and its sequel to GT Interactive. GTI was later acquired by [[Infogrames]], which has since been renamed to [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]]. Monolith itself was acquired by [[Warner Bros. Entertainment|Warner Bros.]], which owns the ''Blood'' [[trademark]] and [[intellectual property]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lith.com/Games/Blood |title=Monolith - Blood\u2122 |publisher=Lith.com |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617191814/http://www.lith.com/Games/Blood |archivedate=June 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Atari re-released ''Blood'' and ''Blood 2'' on Steam and GOG, but unlike other Build engine games (''Duke Nukem 3D'' and ''Shadow Warrior''), the source code for ''Blood'' has not yet been released.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=June 2015}}\n{{Video game reviews\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=GSrev>{{cite web|last=Poole|first=Stephen |title=Blood Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blood-review/1900-2538214/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=6 June 2019 |date=June 6, 1997}}</ref>\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=NG/>\n}}\n''Blood'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews from professional critics, according to [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] based on seven reviews.<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/blood | title=Blood for PC Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=May 14, 2019 }}</ref> Critics especially praised the intricate and creative level designs, humorous wisecracks and pop culture references, over-the-top gore, variety of settings, and inventive, unconventional weaponry.<ref name=GSrev/><ref name=NG/><ref name=GPro106/> ''[[GameSpot]]'' particularly noted that the Voodoo doll \"might be the coolest little accessory to ever grace the weapons belt of a first-person killing machine.\"<ref name=GSrev/>\n\nA few criticisms were voiced about the game, but did not find consensus among reviewers.

This movement informed and helped shape the vigorous and polarizing debate, primarily in the United States, during the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s on how to end the war.\n\nMany in the [[peace movement]] within the United States were students, mothers, or [[counterculture of the 1960s|anti-establishment]] hippies. Opposition grew with participation by the African-American civil rights, women's liberation, [[Chicano Movement]]s, and sectors of organized labor. Additional involvement came from many other groups, including educators, clergy, academics, journalists, lawyers, physicians\u2014such as [[Benjamin Spock]]\u2014and military [[veteran]]s.\n\nTheir actions consisted mainly of peaceful, [[nonviolent]] events; few events were deliberately provocative and violent. In some cases, police used violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators. By 1967, according to [[Gallup poll]]s, an increasing majority of Americans considered military involvement in Vietnam to be a mistake, echoed decades later by the then-head of American war planning, former Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/us/07mcnamara.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=Robert S. McNamara, Architect of a Futile War, Dies at 93|date=July 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons==\n[[File:Vietnam War protesters. 1967. Wichita, Kans - NARA - 283625.jpg|thumb|Vietnam War protesters in Wichita, Kansas, 1967]]\nThe draft, a system of [[conscription]] that mainly drew from minorities and lower and middle class whites, drove much of the protest after 1965. [[Conscientious objector]]s played an active role despite their small numbers. The prevailing sentiment that the draft was unfairly administered inflamed [[blue-collar]] American, especially African-American, opposition to the military draft itself.\n\nOpposition to the war arose during a time of unprecedented [[student activism]], which followed the [[free speech movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The military draft mobilized the [[baby boomers]], who were most at risk, but it grew to include a varied cross-section of Americans. The growing opposition to the Vietnam War was partly attributed to greater access to uncensored information through extensive television coverage on the ground in Vietnam.\n\nBeyond opposition to the draft, anti-war protesters also made moral arguments against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. That moral imperative argument against the war was especially popular among American college students, who were more likely than the general public to accuse the United States of having imperialistic goals in Vietnam and to criticize the war as \"immoral.\"<ref>Schuman, Howard.2000.'Two Sources of Antiwar Sentiment in America,' in Hixson, Walter L. (ed) The United States and the Vietnam War: Significant Scholarly Articles. New York: Garland Publishing, pp127\u2013150</ref> Civilian deaths, which were downplayed or omitted entirely by the Western media, became a subject of protest when photographic evidence of casualties emerged. An infamous photo of General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Loan]] shooting an alleged terrorist in handcuffs during the [[Tet Offensive]] also provoked public outcry.<ref name=\"Guttmann\">Guttmann, Allen. 1969. Protest against the War in Vietnam. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 382. pp. 56\u201363,</ref>\n\nAnother element of the American opposition to the war was the perception that U.S. intervention in Vietnam, which had been argued as acceptable because of the [[domino theory]] and the threat of [[communism]], was not legally justifiable. Some Americans believed that the communist threat was used as a scapegoat to hide imperialistic intentions, and others argued that the American intervention in South Vietnam interfered with the [[self-determination]] of the country and felt that the war in Vietnam was a civil war that ought to have determined the fate of the country and that America was wrong to intervene.<ref name=\"Guttmann\"/>\n\n[[U.S. news media and the Vietnam War|Media coverage of the war]] also shook the faith of citizens at home as new television brought images of wartime conflict to the kitchen table. Newsmen like NBC's Frank McGee stated that the war was all but lost as a \"conclusion to be drawn inescapably from the facts.\"<ref name=\"Guttmann\"/> For the first time in American history, the media had the means to broadcast battlefield images. Graphic footage of casualties on the nightly news eliminated any myth of the glory of war. With no clear sign of victory in Vietnam, American military casualties helped stimulate opposition to the war by Americans. In their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] reject the mainstream view of how the media influenced the war and propose that the media instead censored the more brutal images of the fighting and the death of millions of innocent people.\n\n==Polarization==\n{{quote|If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read \"Vietnam.\"|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], 1967<ref>''Life'' magazine: Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 40 Years Later. Time Inc, 2008. Pg 139</ref>}}\n\nThe U.S. became polarized over the war. Many supporters of U.S. involvement argued for what was known as the [[domino theory]], a theory that believed if one country fell to communism, then the bordering countries would be sure to fall as well, much like falling dominoes. This theory was largely held due to the fall of eastern Europe to communism and the Soviet sphere of influence following World War II. However, military critics of the war pointed out that the Vietnam War was political and that the military mission lacked any clear idea of how to achieve its objectives. Civilian critics of the war argued that the government of South Vietnam lacked political legitimacy, or that support for the war was completely immoral.\n\nThe media also played a substantial role in the polarization of American opinion regarding the Vietnam War. For example, In 1965 a majority of the media attention focused on military tactics with very little discussion about the necessity for a full scale intervention in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Herman, Edward S. 2002\">Herman, Edward S. & Chomsky, Noam. (2002) Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media. New York: Pantheon Books.</ref>  After 1965, the media covered the dissent and domestic controversy that existed within the United States, but mostly excluded the actual view of dissidents and resisters.<ref name=\"Herman, Edward S. 2002\"/>\n\nThe media established a sphere of public discourse surrounding the Hawk versus Dove debate. The Dove was a liberal and a critic of the war. Doves claimed that the war was well\u2013intentioned but a disastrously wrong mistake in an otherwise benign foreign policy. It is important to note the Doves did not question the U.S. intentions in intervening in Vietnam, nor did they question the morality or legality of the U.S. intervention. Rather, they made pragmatic claims that the war was a mistake. Contrarily, the Hawks argued that the war was legitimate and winnable and a part of the benign U.S. foreign policy. The Hawks claimed that the one-sided criticism of the media contributed to the decline of public support for the war and ultimately helped the U.S. lose the war. Author William F. Buckley repeatedly wrote about his approval for the war and suggested that \"The United States has been timid, if not cowardly, in refusing to seek 'victory' in Vietnam.\"<ref name=\"Guttmann\" />  The hawks claimed that the liberal media was responsible for the growing popular disenchantment with the war and blamed the western media for losing the war in Southeast Asia as communism was no longer a threat for them.\n\n==Antiwar movement==\nAs the Vietnam War continued to escalate, public disenchantment grew and a variety of different groups were formed or became involved in the movement.\n\n===Students===\n[[File:Washington D.C.

Doug McAdam explains the success of the mass mobilization of volunteers for [[Freedom Summer]] in terms of \"Biographical Availability\", where individuals must have a certain degree of social, economic, and psychological freedom to be able to participate in large scale social movements.<ref>Meyer, David S. 2007. The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  This explanation can also be applied to the Anti-War Movement because it occurred around the same time and the same biographical factors applied to the college-aged anti-war protesters. David Meyers (2007) also explains how the concept of [[Self-efficacy|personal efficacy]] affects mass movement mobilization. For example, according to Meyers' thesis, consider that American wealth increased drastically after World War II. At this time, America was a superpower and enjoyed great affluence after thirty years of depression, war, and sacrifice. Benjamin T. Harrison (2000) argues that the post World War II affluence set the stage for the protest generation in the 1960s.<ref>Harrison, Benjamin T. (2000)'Roots of the Anti-Vietnam War Movement,' in Hixson, Walter (ed) the Vietnam Antiwar Movement. New York: Garland Publishing</ref> His central thesis is that the World Wars and Great Depression spawned a '[[beat generation]]' refusing to conform to mainstream American values which lead to the emergence of the [Hippies] and the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture.]] The Anti-war movement became part of a larger protest movement against the traditional American Values and attitudes. Meyers (2007) builds off this claim in his argument that the \"relatively privileged enjoy the education and affirmation that afford them the belief that they might make a difference.\"<ref>p49</ref> As a result of the present factors in terms of affluence, biographical availability (defined in the sociological areas of activism as the lack of restrictions on social relationships of which most likely increases the consequences of participating in a social movement), and increasing political atmosphere across the county, political activity increased drastically on college campuses.\n\nCollege enrollment reached 9 million by the end of the 1960s. Colleges and universities in America had more students than ever before, and these institutions often tried to restrict student behavior to maintain order on the campuses. To combat this, many college students became active in causes that promoted free speech, student input in the curriculum, and an end to archaic social restrictions. Students joined the antiwar movement because they did not want to fight in a foreign civil war that they believed did not concern them or because they were morally opposed to all war. Others disliked the war because it diverted funds and attention away from problems in the U.S. Intellectual growth and gaining a liberal perspective at college caused many students to become active in the antiwar movement. Another attractive feature of the opposition movement was the fact that it was a popular social event. \nMost student antiwar organizations were locally or campus-based, including chapters of the very loosely co-ordinated [[Students for a Democratic Society]], because they were easier to organize and participate in than national groups. Common antiwar demonstrations for college students featured attempts to sever ties between the war machine and universities through [[Draft card burning|burning draft cards]], protesting universities furnishing grades to draft boards, and protesting military and Dow Chemical job fairs on campus.<ref name=uwmad>{{cite web |url=https://1967.wisc.edu/ |title=A Turning Point |author=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=2017 |access-date= 26 Oct 2017 }}</ref><ref name=worland>\n{{cite magazine |last=Worland |first=Gayle |date=8 Oct 2017 |title=50 years ago, 'Dow Day' left its mark on Madison |url=https://host.madison.com/wsj/article_47f7dc75-e30a-5a16-8cf1-044eebc66f18.html |magazine=Wisconsin State Journal |location=Madison, WI |publisher=John Humenik |access-date=26 Oct 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027125430/http://host.madison.com/wsj/article_47f7dc75-e30a-5a16-8cf1-044eebc66f18.html |archive-date=2017-10-27 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> From 1969 to 1970, student protesters attacked 197 ROTC buildings on college campuses. Protests grew after the [[Kent State shootings]], radicalizing more and more students. Although the media often portrayed the student antiwar movement as aggressive and widespread, only 10% of the 2500 colleges in the United States had violent protests throughout the Vietnam War years. By the early 1970s, most student protest movements died down due to President Nixon's de-escalation of the war, the economic downturn, and disillusionment with the powerlessness of the antiwar movement.<ref name=fry/>\n\n===Arts===\nMany artists during the 1960s and 1970s opposed the war and used their creativity and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], and [[Robert Bly]]. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war as well as the disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists [[Ronald Haeberle]], [[Peter Saul]], and [[Nancy Spero]], among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as [[Lenny Lipton]], Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from the antiwar marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights like [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Megan Terry]], Grant Duay, and [[Kenneth Bernard]] used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans to think more critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular in the early years of the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=149\u2013161|last=Greene|first=Alexis|authorlink=The Arts and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|editor=Barbara Tischler}}</ref>\n\n===Women===\nWomen were a large part of the antiwar movement, even though they were sometimes relegated to second-class status within the organizations or faced sexism within opposition groups.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=149\u2013161|last=Adams|first=Nina|authorlink=The Arts and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|editor=Barbara Tischler|ref={{harvid|Adams|1992}} }}</ref> Some leaders of anti-war groups viewed women as sex objects or secretaries, not actual thinkers who could contribute positively and tangibly to the group's goals, or believed that women could not truly understand and join the antiwar movement because they were unaffected by the draft.<ref name=\"Swerdlow 159\u2013170\">{{harvnb|Swerdlow|1992|pp=159\u2013170}}</ref> Women involved in opposition groups disliked the romanticism of the violence of both the war and the antiwar movement that was common amongst male war protesters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|title=The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America|url=https://archive.org/details/worldsplitopen00ruth|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|ref={{harvid|Rosen|2006}} }}</ref>  Despite the inequalities, participation in various antiwar groups allowed women to gain experience with organizing protests and crafting effective antiwar rhetoric. These newfound skills combined with their dislike of sexism within the opposition movement caused many women to break away from the mainstream antiwar movement and create or join women's antiwar groups, such as [[Another Mother for Peace]], [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF), and [[Women Strike for Peace]] ([[Women Strike for Peace|WSP]]), also known as Women For Peace. Female soldiers serving in Vietnam joined the movement to battle the war and sexism, racism, and the established military bureaucracy by writing articles for antiwar and antimilitary newspapers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=197\u2013209|last=Tischler|first=Barbara|authorlink=Voices of Protest: Women and the GI Antiwar Press|editor=Barbara Tischler}}</ref>\n\nMothers and older generations of women joined the opposition movement, as advocates for peace and people opposed to the effects of the war and the draft on the generation of young men. These women saw the draft as one of the most disliked parts of the war machine and sought to undermine the war itself through undermining the draft. Another Mother for Peace and [[Women Strike for Peace|WSP]] often held free draft counseling centers to give young men legal and illegal methods to oppose the draft.<ref name=\"Swerdlow 159\u2013170\"/> Members of Women For Peace showed up at the White House every Sunday for 8 years from 11 to 1 for a peace vigil.<ref>{{harvnb|Small|1992|p=92}}</ref> Such female antiwar groups often relied on maternalism, the image of women as peaceful caretakers of the world, to express and accomplish their goals. The government often saw middle-aged women involved in such organizations as the most dangerous members of the opposition movement because they were ordinary citizens who quickly and efficiently mobilized.<ref>{{harvnb|Small|1992|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMany women in America sympathized with the Vietnamese civilians affected by the war and joined the opposition movement.

Of these organizations, the Bay Area Coalition Against the War was the biggest and most significant. One of the major reasons leading to their significance was that the BAACAW was \"highly organized, holding biweekly ninety-minute meetings of the Coordinating Committee at which each regional would submit detailed reports and action plans.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: The Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=101}}</ref> The driving force behind their formation was their anger at \"the [[Operation Linebacker II|bombing of Hanoi]] and the [[Operation Pocket Money|mining of Haiphong Harbor]].\" Another aspect of the group's prevalence was the support of the [[Japanese Community Youth Center]], members of the Asian Community Center, student leaders of Asian American student unions, etc. who stood behind it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=101}}</ref> The BAACAW members consisted of many Asians Americans and they were involved in antiwar efforts like marches, study groups, fundraisers, [[teach-in]]s and demonstrations. During marches, Asian American activists carried banners that read \"Stop the Bombing of Asian People and Stop Killing Our Asian Brothers and Sisters.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Erika|title=The Making of Asian America: A History|url=https://archive.org/details/makingofasianame00leee|url-access=registration|date=2015|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=[https://archive.org/details/makingofasianame00leee/page/308 308]}}</ref> Its newsletter stated, \"our goal is to build a solid, broad-based anti-imperialist movement of Asian people against the war in Vietnam.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=120}}</ref>\n\nThe anti-war sentiment by Asian Americans was fueled by the racial inequality that they faced in the United States. As historian [[Daryl Maeda]] notes, \"the antiwar movement articulated Asian Americans' racial commonality with Vietnamese people in two distinctly gendered ways: identification based on the experiences of male soldiers and identification by women.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=104}}</ref> Asian American soldiers in the U.S. military were many times classified as being like the enemy. They were referred to as [[gook]]s and had a racialized identity in comparison to their non-Asian counterparts. There was also the [[hypersexualization]] of Vietnamese women which in turn affected how Asian American women in the military were treated. \"In a [[Gidra (newspaper)|Gidra]] article, [a prominent influential newspaper of the Asian American movement], [[Evelyn Yoshimura]] noted that the U.S. military systematically portrayed Vietnamese women as [[prostitutes]] as a way of dehumanizing them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=113}}</ref> Asian American groups realized in order to extinguish [[Anti-Asian racism in the United States|racism]], they also had to address sexism as well. This in turn led to women's leadership in the Asian American antiwar movement. [[Patsy Chan]], a \"Third World\" activist, said at an antiwar rally in [[San Francisco]], \"We, as [[Third World]] women [express] our militant solidarity with our brothers and sisters from Indochina.

[ consisting of the members] JoAnne 'Nobuko' Miyamoto, Chris Iijima, and William 'Charlie' Chin, performed across the nation as traveling troubadours who set the antiracist politics of the Asian American movement to music.\"<ref name=\"Srikanth and Song\"/> This band was so against the imperialistic actions of the United States, that they supported the Vietnamese people vocally through their song 'War of the Flea'.<ref name=\"Srikanth and Song\"/> Asian American poets and playwrights also joined in unity with the movement's antiwar sentiments. [[Melvyn Escueta]] created the play 'Honey Bucket' and was an Asian American veteran of the war. Through this play, \"Escueta establishes equivalencies between his protagonist, a Filipino American soldier named Andy, and the Vietnamese people.\"<ref name=\"Srikanth and Song\"/>\n\n\"The Asian American antiwar movement emerged from a belief that the mainstream peace movement was racist in its disregard to Asians ... Steve Louie remembers that while the white antiwar movement had 'this moral thing about no killing,' Asian Americans sought to bring attention to 'a bigger issue ... genocide.' ... the broader movement had a hard time with the Asian movement ... because it broadened the issues out beyond where they wanted to go ... the whole question of U.S. imperialism as a system, at home and abroad.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\n===Clergy===\nThe clergy, often a forgotten group during the opposition to the Vietnam War, played a large role as well. The clergy covered any of the religious leaders and members including individuals such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] In his speech \"Beyond Vietnam\" King stated, \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.\"<ref>King, \"Beyond Vietnam\"</ref> King was not looking for racial equality through this speech, but tried to voice for an end to the war instead.\n\nThe involvement of the clergy did not stop at King though. The analysis entitled \"Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement\" expands upon the anti-war movement by taking King, a single religious figurehead, and explaining the movement from the entire clergy's perspective. The clergy were often forgotten though throughout this opposition. The analysis refers to that fact by saying, \"The research concerning clergy anti-war participation is even more barren than the literature on student activism.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Tygart, \"Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement\"</ref> There is a relationship and correlation between [[theology]] and political opinions and during the Vietnam War, the same relationship occurred between feelings about the war and theology.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> This article basically was a social experiment finding results on how the pastors and clergy members reacted to the war. Based on the results found, they most certainly did not believe in the war and wished to help end it.\n\nAnother source, ''Lift Up Your Voice Like A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954\u20131973'' explains the story of the entire spectrum of the clergy and their involvement. [[Michael Freidland]] is able to completely tell the story in his chapter entitled, \"A Voice of Moderation: Clergy and the Anti-War Movement: 1966\u20131967\". In basic summary, each specific clergy from each religion had their own view of the war and how they dealt with it, but as a whole, the clergy was completely against the war.<ref>Friedland, ''Lift Up Your Voice Like A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954\u20131973''</ref>\n\n===Soldiers===\n{{Further|G.I. movement}}\nWithin the United States military various soldiers would organize to avoid military duties and individual actors would also carry out their own acts of resistance.<ref name=wash>{{cite web |url=https://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/gi_mvmt.shtml |title=GI Movement, 1968-1973: Special Section |last=Kindig |first=Jessie |website=washington.edu }}</ref><ref name=monthly>{{cite web |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2016/06/01/vietnam-and-the-soldiers-revolt/ |title=Vietnam and the Soldiers' Revolt The Politics of a Forgotten History |last=Seidman |first=Derek |website=monthlyreview.ord }}</ref>\n\n===Organizations===\n*[[Committee for NonViolent Action]] (CNVA)&nbsp;\u2013 radical [[Pacifism|pacifist]] organization that \"blended philosophical [[anarchism]] with [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] pacifism.\"<ref name=\"Debenedette, Charles 2000\">Debenedette, Charles.

Sloan]]'s [[folk rock]] song [[Eve of Destruction (song)|''Eve of Destruction'']], recorded by [[Barry McGuire]] as one of the earliest musical protests against the Vietnam War. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Brummer |first1=Justin |title=Vietnam War Song Project |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/JBrummer/vietnam-war-song-project/ |website=Rate Your Music |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nA key figure on the [[rock music|rock]] end of the antiwar spectrum was [[Jimi Hendrix]] (1942\u20131970). Hendrix had a huge following among the youth culture exploring itself through drugs and experiencing itself through rock music. He was not an official protester of the war; one of Hendrix's biographers contends that Hendrix, being a former soldier, sympathized with the anticommunist view.<ref>Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 248. Print.</ref> He did, however, protest the violence that took place in the Vietnam War. With the song \"[[Machine Gun (Jimi Hendrix song)|Machine Gun]]\", dedicated to those fighting in Vietnam, this protest of violence is manifest. David Henderson, author of '''Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky'', describes the song as \"scary funk ... his sound over the drone shifts from a woman's scream, to a siren, to a fighter plane diving, all amid [[Buddy Miles]]' Gatling-gun snare shots. ... he says 'evil man make me kill you ... make you kill me although we're only families apart.'\"<ref>Henderson, David. 'Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky: Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Child. New York: Atria, 2009. 339. Print</ref> This song was often accompanied with pleas from Hendrix to bring the soldiers back home and cease the bloodshed.<ref>Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 221. Print.</ref> While Hendrix's views may not have been analogous to the protesters, his songs became anthems to the antiwar movement. Songs such as \"Star Spangled Banner\" showed individuals that \"you can love your country, but hate the government.\"<ref>Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 271. Print.</ref> Hendrix's anti-violence efforts are summed up in his words: \"when the power of love overcomes the love of power ... the world will know peace.\" Thus, Hendrix's personal views did not coincide perfectly with those of the antiwar protesters; however, his anti-violence outlook was a driving force during the years of the Vietnam War even after his death (1970).\n\nThe song known to many as the anthem of the protest movement was [[The \"Fish\" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]\u2014first released on an [[Extended play|EP]] in the October 1965 issue of ''Rag Baby''\u2014by [[Country Joe and the Fish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/ragbaby.htm|title=Country Joe's Place|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> one of the most successful protest bands. Although this song was not on music charts probably because it was too radical, it was performed at many public events including the famous [[Woodstock]] music festival (1969). \"Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag\" was a song that used sarcasm to communicate the problems with not only the war but also the public's na\u00efve attitudes towards it. It was said that \"the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was doing to the country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else.\"<ref>Andresen, Lee. Battle Notes. Superior: Savage Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nAlong with singer-songwriter [[Phil Ochs]], who attended and organized anti-war events and wrote such songs as \"I Ain't Marching Anymore\" and \"The War Is Over\", another key historical figure of the antiwar movement was [[Bob Dylan]]. Folk and Rock were critical aspects of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] during the Vietnam War<ref>\nJames, David. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/466424 The Vietnam War and American Music] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215130253/https://www.jstor.org/stable/466424 |date=2018-12-15 }}.\" Social Text 23 (1989): 132.

[[Tor Egil F\u00f8rland]], in his article \"Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist\", quotes Todd Gitlin, a leader of a student movement at the time, in saying \"Whether he liked it or not, Dylan sang for us. ...

To complement \"Blowin' in the Wind\" Dylan's song \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times they are A-Changin']]\" alludes to a new method of governing that is necessary and warns those who currently participate in government that the change is imminent. Dylan tells the \"senators and congressmen [to] please heed the call.\" Dylan's songs were designed to awaken the public and to cause a reaction. The protesters of the Vietnam War identified their cause so closely with the artistic compositions of Dylan that Joan Baez and Judy Collins performed \"The Times they are A-Changin'\" at a march protesting the Vietnam War (1965) and also for President Johnson.<ref name=\"jstor1992\"/> While Dylan renounced the idea of subscribing to the ideals of one individual, his feelings of protest towards Vietnam were appropriated by the general movement and they \"awaited his gnomic yet oracular pronouncements\", which provided a guiding aspect to the movement as a whole.<ref>\nF\u00f8rland, Tor Egil. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27555682 Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215123108/https://www.jstor.org/stable/27555682 |date=2018-12-15 }}.\" Journal of American Studies 26.3 (1992): 352.

Given his immense fame due to the success of the Beatles, he was a very prominent movement figure with the constant media and press attention. Still being proactive on their honeymoon, the newlyweds controversially held a sit-in, where they sat in bed for a week answering press questions. They held numerous sit-ins, one where they first introduced their song \"Give Peace a Chance\". Lennon and Ono's song overshadowed many previous held anthems, as it became known as the ultimate anthem of peace in the 1970s, with their words \"all we are saying ... is give peace a chance\" being sung globally. \"[McCormick, Anita Louise.

On November 2, 32-year-old [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Norman Morrison]] set himself on fire in front of [[The Pentagon]]. On November 9, 22-year-old [[Catholic Worker Movement]] member [[Roger Allen LaPorte]] did the same in front of [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City. Both protests were conscious imitations of earlier (and ongoing) [[Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c|Buddhist protests]] in South Vietnam.\n\n[[File:vietnamdem.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|1967 Anti-Vietnam War demonstration at [[The Pentagon]]]]\nProtests against the Vietnam War took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The protests were part of a movement in opposition to the Vietnam War and took place mainly in the United States. (See also [[Students for a Democratic Society]], [[Free Speech Movement]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Youth International Party]], [[Chicago Seven]].)\n\nThe growing anti-war movement alarmed many in the U.S. government. On August 16, 1966 the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) began investigations of Americans who were suspected of aiding the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|NLF]], with the intent to introduce legislation making these activities illegal. Anti-war demonstrators disrupted the meeting and 50 were arrested.\n\n[[File:Demonstratie tegen oorlog in Vietnam, NATO enz. in Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 921-2506.jpg|thumb|upright|Protest against the Vietnam War in [[Amsterdam]], April 1968]]\nIn February 1967, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' published \"[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]\", an essay by [[Noam Chomsky]], one of the leading intellectual opponents of the war. In the essay Chomsky argued that much responsibility for the war lay with liberal intellectuals and technical experts who were providing what he saw as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] justification for the policies of the U.S. government. The Time Inc magazines ''Time'' and ''Life'' maintained a very pro-war editorial stance until October 1967, when in a ''volte-face'', the editor-in-chief, [[Hedley Donovan]], came out against the war.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam'' p.488-489.</ref> Donovan wrote in an editorial in ''Life'' that the United States had gone into Vietnam for \"honorable and sensible purposes\", but the war had turned out to be \"harder, longer, more complicated\" than expected.<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\">Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam'' p.489.</ref> Donovan ended his editorial by writing the war was \"not worth winning\", as South Vietnam was \"not absolutely imperative\" to maintain American interests in Asia, which made it impossible \"to ask young Americans to die for\".<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\"/>\n\nOn February 1, 1968, [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n L\u00e9m]], a [[Vietcong]] officer suspected of participating in murder of South Vietnamese government officials during the [[Tet Offensive]], was [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Loan]], the South Vietnamese National Police Chief. Loan shot L\u00e9m in the head on a public street in [[Saigon]] front of journalists. South Vietnamese reports provided as justification after the fact claimed that L\u00e9m was captured near the site of a ditch holding as many as thirty-four bound and shot bodies of police and their relatives, some of whom were the families of General Loan's deputy and close friend. The execution provided an iconic image that helped sway public opinion in the United States against the war.\n\nThe events of Tet in early 1968 as a whole were also remarkable in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as [[Walter Cronkite]], interpreted such events as the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon#Tet Offensive|attack on the American embassy]] in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness.<ref>Karnow, Stanley \"Vietnam\"</ref> The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American people that the military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.\n\nIn May 1969, ''Life'' magazine published in a single issue photographs of the faces of the roughly 250 or so American servicemen who had been killed in Vietnam during a \"routine week\" of war in the spring of 1969.<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\"/> Contrary to expectations, the issue sold out with many being haunted by the photographs of the ordinary young Americans killed.<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\"/> On October 15, 1969, hundreds of thousands of people took part in [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|National Moratorium]] anti-war demonstrations across the United States; the demonstrations prompted many workers to call in sick from their jobs and adolescents nationwide engaged in [[truancy]] from school. About 15 million Americans took part in the demonstration of 15 October, making it the largest protests in a single day up to that point.<ref>Fountain, Aaron \"The War in the Schools: San Francisco Bay Area High Schools and the Anti\u2013Vietnam War Movement, 1965\u20131973\" p.33</ref>  A second round of \"Moratorium\" demonstrations was held on November 15 and attracted more people than the first.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam'' p.600.</ref>\n\n[[File:My Lai massacre.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|The [[My Lai massacre]] was used as an example of bad military conduct during the Vietnam War.]]\nThe U.S. realized that the South Vietnamese government needed a solid base of popular support if it were to survive the insurgency. To pursue this goal of winning the \"[[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam)|Hearts and Minds]]\" of the Vietnamese people, units of the [[United States Army]], referred to as \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" units, were used extensively for the first time since World War II.\n\nCivil Affairs units, while remaining armed and under direct military control, engaged in what came to be known as \"[[nation-building]]\": constructing (or reconstructing) schools, public buildings, roads and other [[infrastructure]]; conducting medical programs for civilians who had no access to medical facilities; facilitating cooperation among local civilian leaders; conducting hygiene and other training for civilians; and similar activities.\n\nThis policy of attempting to [[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam War)|win the hearts and minds]] of the Vietnamese people, however, often was at odds with other aspects of the war which sometimes served to antagonize many Vietnamese civilians and provided ammunition to the anti-war movement. These included the emphasis on \"[[body count]]\" as a way of measuring military success on the battlefield, civilian casualties during the bombing of villages (symbolized by journalist [[Peter Arnett]]'s famous quote, \"it was necessary to destroy the village to save it\"), and the killing of civilians in such incidents as the [[My Lai massacre]]. In 1974 the documentary [[Hearts and Minds (film)|''Hearts and Minds'']] sought to portray the devastation the war was causing to the South Vietnamese people, and won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best documentary amid considerable controversy. The South Vietnamese government also antagonized many of its citizens with its suppression of political opposition, through such measures as holding large numbers of political prisoners, torturing political opponents, and holding a [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u#Re-elected unopposed and stagnation|one-man election for President]] in 1971. Covert counter-terror programs and semi-covert ones such as the [[Phoenix Program]] attempted, with the help of anthropologists, to isolate rural South Vietnamese villages and affect the loyalty of the residents.\n\n[[File:Man wearing Purple Heart medal during Vietnam peace march, 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|This man wears a [[Purple Heart]] medal as he watches a San Francisco peace march, April 1967.]]\nDespite the increasingly depressing news of the war, many Americans continued to support President Johnson's endeavors. Aside from the domino theory mentioned above, there was a feeling that the goal of preventing a communist takeover of a pro-Western government in South Vietnam was a noble objective. Many Americans were also concerned about saving face in the event of disengaging from the war or, as President [[Richard M. Nixon]] later put it, \"achieving Peace with Honor.\" In addition, instances of Viet Cong atrocities were widely reported, most notably in an article that appeared in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in 1968 entitled ''The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh''.\n\nHowever, anti-war feelings also began to rise. Many Americans opposed the war on moral grounds, appalled by the devastation and violence of the war. Others claimed the conflict was a war against Vietnamese independence, or an intervention in a foreign [[civil war]]; others opposed it because they felt it lacked clear objectives and appeared to be unwinnable. Many anti-war activists were themselves [[Vietnam veteran]]s, as evidenced by the organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. In April 1971, thousands of these veterans converged on the White House in Washington, D.C., and hundreds of them threw their [[medal]]s and [[Military decoration|decorations]] on the steps of the [[United States Capitol]]. By this time, it had also become commonplace for the most radical anti-war demonstrators to prominently display the flag of the Viet Cong \"enemy\", an act which alienated many who were otherwise morally opposed to the war.\n\n==Political factors==\nIn 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson began his re-election campaign. [[Eugene McCarthy]] ran against him for the nomination on an anti-war platform. McCarthy did not win the first primary election in [[New Hampshire]], but he did surprisingly well against an incumbent. The resulting blow to the Johnson campaign, taken together with other factors, led the President to make a surprise announcement in a March 31 televised speech that he was pulling out of the race. He also announced the initiation of the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Negotiations]] with Vietnam in that speech. Then, on August 4, 1969, U.S. representative [[Henry Kissinger]] and North Vietnamese representative [[Xuan Thuy]] began secret peace negotiations at the apartment of French intermediary [[Jean Sainteny]] in Paris.\n\nAfter breaking with Johnson's pro-war stance, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] entered the race on March 16 and ran for the nomination on an anti-war platform. Johnson's vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], also ran for the nomination, promising to continue to support the South Vietnamese government.\n\n==Draft==\n{{Main|Draft evasion in the Vietnam War}}\n{{See also|Kent State shootings|Jackson State killings}}\n[[File:Charles DeGaulle and Ho Chi Minh are hanged in effigy during the National Shame Day celebration in Saigon, July 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Students demonstrate in [[Saigon]], July 1964, observing the tenth anniversary of the July 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Agreements]].]]\n[[File:Anti Vietnam war demonstration.

Another nineteen cards were burnt on May 22 at a demonstration following the Berkeley [[teach-in]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html |title=UC Berkeley Library Social Activism Sound Recording Project: Anti-Vietnam War Protests&nbsp;\u2013 San Francisco Bay Area |publisher=Lib.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref> Draft card protests were not aimed so much at the draft as at the immoral conduct of the war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=George Q. |title=The Draft, 1940\u20131973 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |year=1993 |series=Modern war studies |isbn=978-0-7006-0586-6 |page=175}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, only a fraction of all men of draft age were actually [[Conscription in the United States|conscripted]], but the [[Selective Service System]] office (\"Draft Board\") in each locality had broad discretion on whom to draft and whom to exempt where there was no clear guideline for exemption. In late July 1965, Johnson doubled the number of young men to be drafted per month from 17,000 to 35,000, and on August 31, signed a law making it a crime to burn a draft card.\n\nOn October 15, 1965 the student-run [[National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] in New York staged the first draft card burning to result in an arrest under the new law.\n\nIn 1967, the continued operation of a seemingly unfair draft system then calling as many as 40,000 men for induction each month fueled a burgeoning draft resistance movement. The draft favored white, middle-class men, which allowed an economically and racially discriminating draft to force young African American men to serve in rates that were disproportionately higher than the general population. Although in 1967 there was a smaller field of draft eligible black men\u201329 percent versus 63 percent of draft eligible white men\u201364 percent of black men were chosen to serve in the war through conscription, compared to only 31 percent of eligible white men.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham III|first=Herman|title=The Brothers' Vietnam War: Black Power, Manhood, and the Military Experience|year=2003|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1967, draft card turn-ins were held across the country, yielding more than 1,000 draft cards, later returned to the [[Justice Department (US)|Justice Department]] as an act of [[civil disobedience]].

Some men were rejected by the military as [[Class 1-A|4-F]] unfit for service failing to meet physical, mental, or moral standards. Still others joined the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] or entered the [[Peace Corps]] as a way of avoiding Vietnam. All of these issues raised concerns about the fairness of who got selected for involuntary service, since it was often the poor or those without connections who were drafted. Ironically, in light of modern political issues, a certain exemption was a convincing claim of [[homosexuality]], but very few men attempted this because of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] involved. Also, conviction for certain crimes earned an exclusion, the topic of the anti-war song \"[[Alice's Restaurant]]\" by [[Arlo Guthrie]].\n\nEven many of those who never received a deferment or exemption never served, simply because the pool of eligible men was so huge compared to the number required for service, that the draft boards never got around to drafting them when a new crop of men became available (until 1969) or because they had high lottery numbers (1970 and later).\n\nOf those soldiers who served during the war, there was increasing opposition to the conflict amongst GIs,<ref>\n[http://libcom.org/history/articles/vietnam-gi-resistance 1961\u20131973: GI Resistance in the Vietnam War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051020114848/http://www.libcom.org/history/articles/vietnam-gi-resistance/ |date=2005-10-20 }}, libcom.org\n</ref> which resulted in [[Frag (military)|fragging]] and many other activities which hampered the US's ability to wage war effectively.\n\nMost of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote or drink in most states, and the image of young people being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of enfranchisement or the ability to drink alcohol legally also successfully pressured legislators to lower the [[voting age]] nationally and the [[drinking age]] in many states.\n\nStudent opposition groups on many college and university campuses seized campus administration offices, and in several instances forced the expulsion of [[ROTC]] programs from the campus.\n\nSome Americans who were not subject to the draft protested the conscription of their tax dollars for the war effort. [[Tax resistance|War tax resistance]], once mostly isolated to solitary anarchists like [[Henry David Thoreau]] and religious [[pacifists]] like the [[Quakers]], became a more mainstream protest tactic.

As a condition of room use, press and camera presence were not permitted, but the proceedings were transcribed.\n\nIn addition to [Ron Dellums] (Dem-CA), an additional 19 Congressional representatives took part in the hearings, including: [[Bella Abzug]] (Dem-NY), [[Shirley Chisholm]] (Dem-NY), [[Patsy Mink]] (Dem-HI), [[Parren Mitchell]] (Dem-MD), [[John Conyers]] (Dem-MI), [[Herman Badillo]] (Dem-NY), [[James Abourezk]] (Dem-SD), [[Leo Ryan]] (Dem-CA), [[Phil Burton]] (Dem-CA), [[Don Edwards]] (Dem-CA), [[Pete McCloskey]] (Rep-CA), [[Ed Koch]] (Dem-NY), John Seiberling (Dem-OH), [[Henry Reuss]] (Dem-WI), [[Benjamin Stanley Rosenthal]] (Dem-NY), [[Robert Kastenmeier]] (Dem-WI), and [[Abner J.

Some tactics were described as \"gruesome\", such as the severing of ears from corpses to verify body count. Others involved the killing of civilians. Soldiers claimed to have ordered [[artillery]] strikes on villages which did not appear to have any military presence. Soldiers were claimed to use racist terms such as \"gooks\", \"dinks\" and \"slant eyes\" when referring to the Vietnamese.\n\nWitnesses described that legal, by-the-book instruction was augmented by more questionable training by non-commissioned officers as to how soldiers should conduct themselves. One witness testified about \"[[free-fire area|free-fire zones]]\", areas as large as {{convert|80|sqmi|km2}} in which soldiers were free to shoot any Vietnamese they encountered after curfew without first making sure they were hostile. Allegations of exaggeration of body count, torture, murder and general abuse of civilians and the psychology and motivations of soldiers and officers were discussed at length.\n\n===Fulbright (end to war)===\n{{Main|Fulbright Hearing}}\n\nIn April and May 1971, the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], chaired by Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], held a series of 22 hearings (referred to as the [[Fulbright Hearing]]s) on proposals relating to ending the war. On the third day of the hearings, April 22, 1971, future Senator and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] became the first [[Vietnam veteran]] to testify before Congress in opposition to the war. Speaking on behalf of [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], he argued for the immediate, unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. During nearly two hours of discussions with committee members, Kerry related in some detail the findings of the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]], in which veterans had described personally committing or witnessing [[wiktionary:atrocity|atrocities]] and [[war crimes]].\n\n==Effects==\nThe opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which arguably led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States. [[Howard Zinn]], a controversial historian, states in his book ''A People's History of the United States'' that, \"in the course of the war, there developed in the United States the greatest antiwar movement the nation had ever experienced, a movement that played a critical role in bringing the war to an end.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 469</ref>\n\n===Fewer soldiers===\nThe first effect the opposition had that led to the end of the war was that fewer soldiers were available for the army. The draft was protested and even ROTC programs too. Howard Zinn first provides a note written by a student of Boston University on May 1, 1968, which stated to his draft board, \"I have absolutely no intention to report for that exam, or for induction, or to aid in any way the American war effort against the people of Vietnam ...\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''</ref> The opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 486</ref> This refusal letter soon led to an overflow of refusals ultimately leading to the event provided by Zinn stating, \"In May 1969 the Oakland induction center, where draftees reported from all of Northern California, reported that of 4,400 men ordered to report for induction, 2,400 did not show up. In the first quarter of 1970 the Selective Service System, for the first time, could not meet its quota.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fewer numbers of soldiers as an effect of the opposition to the war also can be traced to the protests against the ROTC programs in colleges. Zinn argues this by stating, \"Student protests against the ROTC resulted in the canceling of those programs in over forty colleges and universities. In 1966, 191,749 college students enrolled in ROTC. By 1973, the number was 72,459.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 491</ref> The number of ROTC students in college drastically dropped and the program lost any momentum it once had before the anti-war movement.\n\n===College campuses===\nA further effect of the opposition was that many college campuses were completely shut down due to protests. These protests led to wear on the government who tried to mitigate the tumultuous behavior and return the colleges back to normal. The colleges involved in the anti-war movement included ones such as, Brown University, Kent State University, and the University of Massachusetts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Even at The College of William and Mary unrest occurred with protests by the students and even some faculty members that resulted in \"multiple informants\" hired to report to the CIA on the activities of students and faculty members.<ref>David McCarthy, \"'The Sun Never Sets on the Activities of the CIA': Project Resistance at William and Mary\"</ref> At the University of Massachusetts, \"The 100th Commencement of the University of Massachusetts yesterday was a protest, a call for peace\", \"Red fists of protest, white peace symbols, and blue doves were stenciled on black academic gowns, and nearly every other senior wore an armband representing a plea for peace.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''  Page 491</ref> Additionally, \"At Boston College, a Catholic institution, six thousand people gathered that evening in the gymnasium to denounce the war.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''   Page 490</ref> At Kent State University, \"on May 4, when students gathered to demonstrate against the war, National Guardsmen fired into the crowd. Four students were killed.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 490</ref> Finally, \"At the Brown University commencement in 1969, two-thirds of the graduating class turned their backs when Henry Kissinger stood up to address them.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Basically, from all of the evidence here provided by the historians, Zinn and McCarthy, the second effect was very prevalent and it was the uproar at many colleges and universities as an effect of the opposition to the United States' involvement in Vietnam.\n\n===American soldiers===\nAnother effect the opposition to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them.<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''  Page 496</ref> The statement of one of the soldiers reads,\n\n<blockquote>Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me.<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 496</ref></blockquote>\n\nHoward Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.\n\n==Timeline==\n{{See also|Lists of protests against the Vietnam War}}\n\n===1964===\n[[File:Demonstrators against the war in Vietnam holding signs on the boardwalk during the 1964 Democratic National Convention (cropped1).jpg|thumb|Demonstrators against the Vietnam War holding signs on the boardwalk during the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]]]\n*On May 12, twelve young men in New York publicly [[Draft-card burning|burned their draft cards]] to protest the war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=George Q. |title=The Draft, 1940\u20131973 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |year=1993 |series=Modern war studies |isbn=978-0700605866 |page=175}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Sherry Gershon |title=Hell no, we won't go!: resisting the draft during the Vietnam War |publisher=Viking |year=1991 |page=xix |quote=1964: May 12\u2014Twelve students at a New York rally burn their draft cards ... |isbn=978-0670839353 |url=https://archive.org/details/hellnowewontgore0000gott }}</ref>\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 Prompted by the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]].\n*In December 1964, [[Joan Baez]] leads six hundred people in an antiwar demonstration in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book|title=An American Ordeal: The Antiwar Movement of the Vietnam Era|url=https://archive.org/details/americanordealan00debe|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, New York|last1=DeBenedetti|first1=Charles|last2=Chatfield|first2=Charles}}</ref>\n\n===1965===\n*On March 24, organized by professors against the war at the [[University of Michigan]], a [[teach-in]] protest was attended by 2,500 participants.

This movement informed and helped shape the vigorous and polarizing debate, primarily in the United States, during the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s on how to end the war.\n\nMany in the [[peace movement]] within the United States were students, mothers, or [[counterculture of the 1960s|anti-establishment]] hippies. Opposition grew with participation by the African-American civil rights, women's liberation, [[Chicano Movement]]s, and sectors of organized labor. Additional involvement came from many other groups, including educators, clergy, academics, journalists, lawyers, physicians\u2014such as [[Benjamin Spock]]\u2014and military [[veteran]]s.\n\nTheir actions consisted mainly of peaceful, [[nonviolent]] events; few events were deliberately provocative and violent. In some cases, police used violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators. By 1967, according to [[Gallup poll]]s, an increasing majority of Americans considered military involvement in Vietnam to be a mistake, echoed decades later by the then-head of American war planning, former Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/us/07mcnamara.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=Robert S. McNamara, Architect of a Futile War, Dies at 93|date=July 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons==\n[[File:Vietnam War protesters. 1967. Wichita, Kans - NARA - 283625.jpg|thumb|Vietnam War protesters in Wichita, Kansas, 1967]]\nThe draft, a system of [[conscription]] that mainly drew from minorities and lower and middle class whites, drove much of the protest after 1965. [[Conscientious objector]]s played an active role despite their small numbers. The prevailing sentiment that the draft was unfairly administered inflamed [[blue-collar]] American, especially African-American, opposition to the military draft itself.\n\nOpposition to the war arose during a time of unprecedented [[student activism]], which followed the [[free speech movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The military draft mobilized the [[baby boomers]], who were most at risk, but it grew to include a varied cross-section of Americans. The growing opposition to the Vietnam War was partly attributed to greater access to uncensored information through extensive television coverage on the ground in Vietnam.\n\nBeyond opposition to the draft, anti-war protesters also made moral arguments against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. That moral imperative argument against the war was especially popular among American college students, who were more likely than the general public to accuse the United States of having imperialistic goals in Vietnam and to criticize the war as \"immoral.\"<ref>Schuman, Howard.2000.'Two Sources of Antiwar Sentiment in America,' in Hixson, Walter L. (ed) The United States and the Vietnam War: Significant Scholarly Articles. New York: Garland Publishing, pp127\u2013150</ref> Civilian deaths, which were downplayed or omitted entirely by the Western media, became a subject of protest when photographic evidence of casualties emerged. An infamous photo of General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Loan]] shooting an alleged terrorist in handcuffs during the [[Tet Offensive]] also provoked public outcry.<ref name=\"Guttmann\">Guttmann, Allen. 1969. Protest against the War in Vietnam. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 382. pp. 56\u201363,</ref>\n\nAnother element of the American opposition to the war was the perception that U.S. intervention in Vietnam, which had been argued as acceptable because of the [[domino theory]] and the threat of [[communism]], was not legally justifiable. Some Americans believed that the communist threat was used as a scapegoat to hide imperialistic intentions, and others argued that the American intervention in South Vietnam interfered with the [[self-determination]] of the country and felt that the war in Vietnam was a civil war that ought to have determined the fate of the country and that America was wrong to intervene.<ref name=\"Guttmann\"/>\n\n[[U.S. news media and the Vietnam War|Media coverage of the war]] also shook the faith of citizens at home as new television brought images of wartime conflict to the kitchen table. Newsmen like NBC's Frank McGee stated that the war was all but lost as a \"conclusion to be drawn inescapably from the facts.\"<ref name=\"Guttmann\"/> For the first time in American history, the media had the means to broadcast battlefield images. Graphic footage of casualties on the nightly news eliminated any myth of the glory of war. With no clear sign of victory in Vietnam, American military casualties helped stimulate opposition to the war by Americans. In their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] reject the mainstream view of how the media influenced the war and propose that the media instead censored the more brutal images of the fighting and the death of millions of innocent people.\n\n==Polarization==\n{{quote|If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read \"Vietnam.\"|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], 1967<ref>''Life'' magazine: Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 40 Years Later. Time Inc, 2008. Pg 139</ref>}}\n\nThe U.S. became polarized over the war. Many supporters of U.S. involvement argued for what was known as the [[domino theory]], a theory that believed if one country fell to communism, then the bordering countries would be sure to fall as well, much like falling dominoes. This theory was largely held due to the fall of eastern Europe to communism and the Soviet sphere of influence following World War II. However, military critics of the war pointed out that the Vietnam War was political and that the military mission lacked any clear idea of how to achieve its objectives. Civilian critics of the war argued that the government of South Vietnam lacked political legitimacy, or that support for the war was completely immoral.\n\nThe media also played a substantial role in the polarization of American opinion regarding the Vietnam War. For example, In 1965 a majority of the media attention focused on military tactics with very little discussion about the necessity for a full scale intervention in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Herman, Edward S. 2002\">Herman, Edward S. & Chomsky, Noam. (2002) Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media. New York: Pantheon Books.</ref>  After 1965, the media covered the dissent and domestic controversy that existed within the United States, but mostly excluded the actual view of dissidents and resisters.<ref name=\"Herman, Edward S. 2002\"/>\n\nThe media established a sphere of public discourse surrounding the Hawk versus Dove debate. The Dove was a liberal and a critic of the war. Doves claimed that the war was well\u2013intentioned but a disastrously wrong mistake in an otherwise benign foreign policy. It is important to note the Doves did not question the U.S. intentions in intervening in Vietnam, nor did they question the morality or legality of the U.S. intervention. Rather, they made pragmatic claims that the war was a mistake. Contrarily, the Hawks argued that the war was legitimate and winnable and a part of the benign U.S. foreign policy. The Hawks claimed that the one-sided criticism of the media contributed to the decline of public support for the war and ultimately helped the U.S. lose the war. Author William F. Buckley repeatedly wrote about his approval for the war and suggested that \"The United States has been timid, if not cowardly, in refusing to seek 'victory' in Vietnam.\"<ref name=\"Guttmann\" />  The hawks claimed that the liberal media was responsible for the growing popular disenchantment with the war and blamed the western media for losing the war in Southeast Asia as communism was no longer a threat for them.\n\n==Antiwar movement==\nAs the Vietnam War continued to escalate, public disenchantment grew and a variety of different groups were formed or became involved in the movement.\n\n===Students===\n[[File:Washington D.C.

Doug McAdam explains the success of the mass mobilization of volunteers for [[Freedom Summer]] in terms of \"Biographical Availability\", where individuals must have a certain degree of social, economic, and psychological freedom to be able to participate in large scale social movements.<ref>Meyer, David S. 2007. The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  This explanation can also be applied to the Anti-War Movement because it occurred around the same time and the same biographical factors applied to the college-aged anti-war protesters. David Meyers (2007) also explains how the concept of [[Self-efficacy|personal efficacy]] affects mass movement mobilization. For example, according to Meyers' thesis, consider that American wealth increased drastically after World War II. At this time, America was a superpower and enjoyed great affluence after thirty years of depression, war, and sacrifice. Benjamin T. Harrison (2000) argues that the post World War II affluence set the stage for the protest generation in the 1960s.<ref>Harrison, Benjamin T. (2000)'Roots of the Anti-Vietnam War Movement,' in Hixson, Walter (ed) the Vietnam Antiwar Movement. New York: Garland Publishing</ref> His central thesis is that the World Wars and Great Depression spawned a '[[beat generation]]' refusing to conform to mainstream American values which lead to the emergence of the [Hippies] and the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture.]] The Anti-war movement became part of a larger protest movement against the traditional American Values and attitudes. Meyers (2007) builds off this claim in his argument that the \"relatively privileged enjoy the education and affirmation that afford them the belief that they might make a difference.\"<ref>p49</ref> As a result of the present factors in terms of affluence, biographical availability (defined in the sociological areas of activism as the lack of restrictions on social relationships of which most likely increases the consequences of participating in a social movement), and increasing political atmosphere across the county, political activity increased drastically on college campuses.\n\nCollege enrollment reached 9 million by the end of the 1960s. Colleges and universities in America had more students than ever before, and these institutions often tried to restrict student behavior to maintain order on the campuses. To combat this, many college students became active in causes that promoted free speech, student input in the curriculum, and an end to archaic social restrictions. Students joined the antiwar movement because they did not want to fight in a foreign civil war that they believed did not concern them or because they were morally opposed to all war. Others disliked the war because it diverted funds and attention away from problems in the U.S. Intellectual growth and gaining a liberal perspective at college caused many students to become active in the antiwar movement. Another attractive feature of the opposition movement was the fact that it was a popular social event. \nMost student antiwar organizations were locally or campus-based, including chapters of the very loosely co-ordinated [[Students for a Democratic Society]], because they were easier to organize and participate in than national groups. Common antiwar demonstrations for college students featured attempts to sever ties between the war machine and universities through [[Draft card burning|burning draft cards]], protesting universities furnishing grades to draft boards, and protesting military and Dow Chemical job fairs on campus.<ref name=uwmad>{{cite web |url=https://1967.wisc.edu/ |title=A Turning Point |author=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=2017 |access-date= 26 Oct 2017 }}</ref><ref name=worland>\n{{cite magazine |last=Worland |first=Gayle |date=8 Oct 2017 |title=50 years ago, 'Dow Day' left its mark on Madison |url=https://host.madison.com/wsj/article_47f7dc75-e30a-5a16-8cf1-044eebc66f18.html |magazine=Wisconsin State Journal |location=Madison, WI |publisher=John Humenik |access-date=26 Oct 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027125430/http://host.madison.com/wsj/article_47f7dc75-e30a-5a16-8cf1-044eebc66f18.html |archive-date=2017-10-27 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> From 1969 to 1970, student protesters attacked 197 ROTC buildings on college campuses. Protests grew after the [[Kent State shootings]], radicalizing more and more students. Although the media often portrayed the student antiwar movement as aggressive and widespread, only 10% of the 2500 colleges in the United States had violent protests throughout the Vietnam War years. By the early 1970s, most student protest movements died down due to President Nixon's de-escalation of the war, the economic downturn, and disillusionment with the powerlessness of the antiwar movement.<ref name=fry/>\n\n===Arts===\nMany artists during the 1960s and 1970s opposed the war and used their creativity and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], and [[Robert Bly]]. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war as well as the disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists [[Ronald Haeberle]], [[Peter Saul]], and [[Nancy Spero]], among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as [[Lenny Lipton]], Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from the antiwar marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights like [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Megan Terry]], Grant Duay, and [[Kenneth Bernard]] used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans to think more critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular in the early years of the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=149\u2013161|last=Greene|first=Alexis|authorlink=The Arts and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|editor=Barbara Tischler}}</ref>\n\n===Women===\nWomen were a large part of the antiwar movement, even though they were sometimes relegated to second-class status within the organizations or faced sexism within opposition groups.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=149\u2013161|last=Adams|first=Nina|authorlink=The Arts and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|editor=Barbara Tischler|ref={{harvid|Adams|1992}} }}</ref> Some leaders of anti-war groups viewed women as sex objects or secretaries, not actual thinkers who could contribute positively and tangibly to the group's goals, or believed that women could not truly understand and join the antiwar movement because they were unaffected by the draft.<ref name=\"Swerdlow 159\u2013170\">{{harvnb|Swerdlow|1992|pp=159\u2013170}}</ref> Women involved in opposition groups disliked the romanticism of the violence of both the war and the antiwar movement that was common amongst male war protesters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|title=The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America|url=https://archive.org/details/worldsplitopen00ruth|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|ref={{harvid|Rosen|2006}} }}</ref>  Despite the inequalities, participation in various antiwar groups allowed women to gain experience with organizing protests and crafting effective antiwar rhetoric.

At an SDS-organized conference at [[UC Berkeley]] in October 1966, SNCC Chair [[Stokely Carmichael]] challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement. Some participants in [[Urban riots|ghetto rebellions]] of the era had already associated their actions with opposition to the Vietnam War, and SNCC first disrupted an Atlanta draft board in August 1966. According to historians Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin, SDS's first Stop the Draft Week of October 1967 was \"inspired by [[Black Power movement|Black Power]] [and] emboldened by the ghetto rebellions.\" SNCC appear to have originated the popular anti-draft slogan: \"Hell no!

Of these organizations, the Bay Area Coalition Against the War was the biggest and most significant. One of the major reasons leading to their significance was that the BAACAW was \"highly organized, holding biweekly ninety-minute meetings of the Coordinating Committee at which each regional would submit detailed reports and action plans.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: The Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=101}}</ref> The driving force behind their formation was their anger at \"the [[Operation Linebacker II|bombing of Hanoi]] and the [[Operation Pocket Money|mining of Haiphong Harbor]].\" Another aspect of the group's prevalence was the support of the [[Japanese Community Youth Center]], members of the Asian Community Center, student leaders of Asian American student unions, etc. who stood behind it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=101}}</ref> The BAACAW members consisted of many Asians Americans and they were involved in antiwar efforts like marches, study groups, fundraisers, [[teach-in]]s and demonstrations.

As historian [[Daryl Maeda]] notes, \"the antiwar movement articulated Asian Americans' racial commonality with Vietnamese people in two distinctly gendered ways: identification based on the experiences of male soldiers and identification by women.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=104}}</ref> Asian American soldiers in the U.S. military were many times classified as being like the enemy. They were referred to as [[gook]]s and had a racialized identity in comparison to their non-Asian counterparts. There was also the [[hypersexualization]] of Vietnamese women which in turn affected how Asian American women in the military were treated. \"In a [[Gidra (newspaper)|Gidra]] article, [a prominent influential newspaper of the Asian American movement], [[Evelyn Yoshimura]] noted that the U.S. military systematically portrayed Vietnamese women as [[prostitutes]] as a way of dehumanizing them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=113}}</ref> Asian American groups realized in order to extinguish [[Anti-Asian racism in the United States|racism]], they also had to address sexism as well. This in turn led to women's leadership in the Asian American antiwar movement. [[Patsy Chan]], a \"Third World\" activist, said at an antiwar rally in [[San Francisco]], \"We, as [[Third World]] women [express] our militant solidarity with our brothers and sisters from Indochina.

[ consisting of the members] JoAnne 'Nobuko' Miyamoto, Chris Iijima, and William 'Charlie' Chin, performed across the nation as traveling troubadours who set the antiracist politics of the Asian American movement to music.\"<ref name=\"Srikanth and Song\"/> This band was so against the imperialistic actions of the United States, that they supported the Vietnamese people vocally through their song 'War of the Flea'.<ref name=\"Srikanth and Song\"/> Asian American poets and playwrights also joined in unity with the movement's antiwar sentiments. [[Melvyn Escueta]] created the play 'Honey Bucket' and was an Asian American veteran of the war. Through this play, \"Escueta establishes equivalencies between his protagonist, a Filipino American soldier named Andy, and the Vietnamese people.\"<ref name=\"Srikanth and Song\"/>\n\n\"The Asian American antiwar movement emerged from a belief that the mainstream peace movement was racist in its disregard to Asians ... Steve Louie remembers that while the white antiwar movement had 'this moral thing about no killing,' Asian Americans sought to bring attention to 'a bigger issue ... genocide.' ... the broader movement had a hard time with the Asian movement ... because it broadened the issues out beyond where they wanted to go ... the whole question of U.S. imperialism as a system, at home and abroad.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\n===Clergy===\nThe clergy, often a forgotten group during the opposition to the Vietnam War, played a large role as well. The clergy covered any of the religious leaders and members including individuals such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] In his speech \"Beyond Vietnam\" King stated, \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.\"<ref>King, \"Beyond Vietnam\"</ref> King was not looking for racial equality through this speech, but tried to voice for an end to the war instead.\n\nThe involvement of the clergy did not stop at King though. The analysis entitled \"Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement\" expands upon the anti-war movement by taking King, a single religious figurehead, and explaining the movement from the entire clergy's perspective. The clergy were often forgotten though throughout this opposition. The analysis refers to that fact by saying, \"The research concerning clergy anti-war participation is even more barren than the literature on student activism.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Tygart, \"Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement\"</ref> There is a relationship and correlation between [[theology]] and political opinions and during the Vietnam War, the same relationship occurred between feelings about the war and theology.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> This article basically was a social experiment finding results on how the pastors and clergy members reacted to the war. Based on the results found, they most certainly did not believe in the war and wished to help end it.\n\nAnother source, ''Lift Up Your Voice Like A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954\u20131973'' explains the story of the entire spectrum of the clergy and their involvement. [[Michael Freidland]] is able to completely tell the story in his chapter entitled, \"A Voice of Moderation: Clergy and the Anti-War Movement: 1966\u20131967\". In basic summary, each specific clergy from each religion had their own view of the war and how they dealt with it, but as a whole, the clergy was completely against the war.<ref>Friedland, ''Lift Up Your Voice Like A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954\u20131973''</ref>\n\n===Soldiers===\n{{Further|G.I. movement}}\nWithin the United States military various soldiers would organize to avoid military duties and individual actors would also carry out their own acts of resistance.<ref name=wash>{{cite web |url=https://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/gi_mvmt.shtml |title=GI Movement, 1968-1973: Special Section |last=Kindig |first=Jessie |website=washington.edu }}</ref><ref name=monthly>{{cite web |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2016/06/01/vietnam-and-the-soldiers-revolt/ |title=Vietnam and the Soldiers' Revolt The Politics of a Forgotten History |last=Seidman |first=Derek |website=monthlyreview.ord }}</ref>\n\n===Organizations===\n*[[Committee for NonViolent Action]] (CNVA)&nbsp;\u2013 radical [[Pacifism|pacifist]] organization that \"blended philosophical [[anarchism]] with [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] pacifism.\"<ref name=\"Debenedette, Charles 2000\">Debenedette, Charles.

As the war continued, and with the new media coverage, the movement snowballed and popular music reflected this. As early as the summer of 1965, music-based protest against the American involvement in Southeast Asia began with works like [[P. F. Sloan]]'s [[folk rock]] song [[Eve of Destruction (song)|''Eve of Destruction'']], recorded by [[Barry McGuire]] as one of the earliest musical protests against the Vietnam War. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Brummer |first1=Justin |title=Vietnam War Song Project |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/JBrummer/vietnam-war-song-project/ |website=Rate Your Music |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nA key figure on the [[rock music|rock]] end of the antiwar spectrum was [[Jimi Hendrix]] (1942\u20131970). Hendrix had a huge following among the youth culture exploring itself through drugs and experiencing itself through rock music. He was not an official protester of the war; one of Hendrix's biographers contends that Hendrix, being a former soldier, sympathized with the anticommunist view.<ref>Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 248. Print.</ref> He did, however, protest the violence that took place in the Vietnam War. With the song \"[[Machine Gun (Jimi Hendrix song)|Machine Gun]]\", dedicated to those fighting in Vietnam, this protest of violence is manifest. David Henderson, author of '''Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky'', describes the song as \"scary funk ... his sound over the drone shifts from a woman's scream, to a siren, to a fighter plane diving, all amid [[Buddy Miles]]' Gatling-gun snare shots. ... he says 'evil man make me kill you ... make you kill me although we're only families apart.'\"<ref>Henderson, David. 'Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky: Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Child. New York: Atria, 2009. 339. Print</ref> This song was often accompanied with pleas from Hendrix to bring the soldiers back home and cease the bloodshed.<ref>Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 221. Print.</ref> While Hendrix's views may not have been analogous to the protesters, his songs became anthems to the antiwar movement. Songs such as \"Star Spangled Banner\" showed individuals that \"you can love your country, but hate the government.\"<ref>Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 271. Print.</ref> Hendrix's anti-violence efforts are summed up in his words: \"when the power of love overcomes the love of power ... the world will know peace.\" Thus, Hendrix's personal views did not coincide perfectly with those of the antiwar protesters; however, his anti-violence outlook was a driving force during the years of the Vietnam War even after his death (1970).\n\nThe song known to many as the anthem of the protest movement was [[The \"Fish\" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]\u2014first released on an [[Extended play|EP]] in the October 1965 issue of ''Rag Baby''\u2014by [[Country Joe and the Fish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/ragbaby.htm|title=Country Joe's Place|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> one of the most successful protest bands. Although this song was not on music charts probably because it was too radical, it was performed at many public events including the famous [[Woodstock]] music festival (1969). \"Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag\" was a song that used sarcasm to communicate the problems with not only the war but also the public's na\u00efve attitudes towards it. It was said that \"the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was doing to the country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else.\"<ref>Andresen, Lee. Battle Notes. Superior: Savage Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nAlong with singer-songwriter [[Phil Ochs]], who attended and organized anti-war events and wrote such songs as \"I Ain't Marching Anymore\" and \"The War Is Over\", another key historical figure of the antiwar movement was [[Bob Dylan]]. Folk and Rock were critical aspects of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] during the Vietnam War<ref>\nJames, David. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/466424 The Vietnam War and American Music] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215130253/https://www.jstor.org/stable/466424 |date=2018-12-15 }}.\" Social Text 23 (1989): 132.

[[Tor Egil F\u00f8rland]], in his article \"Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist\", quotes Todd Gitlin, a leader of a student movement at the time, in saying \"Whether he liked it or not, Dylan sang for us. ...

To complement \"Blowin' in the Wind\" Dylan's song \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times they are A-Changin']]\" alludes to a new method of governing that is necessary and warns those who currently participate in government that the change is imminent. Dylan tells the \"senators and congressmen [to] please heed the call.\" Dylan's songs were designed to awaken the public and to cause a reaction. The protesters of the Vietnam War identified their cause so closely with the artistic compositions of Dylan that Joan Baez and Judy Collins performed \"The Times they are A-Changin'\" at a march protesting the Vietnam War (1965) and also for President Johnson.<ref name=\"jstor1992\"/> While Dylan renounced the idea of subscribing to the ideals of one individual, his feelings of protest towards Vietnam were appropriated by the general movement and they \"awaited his gnomic yet oracular pronouncements\", which provided a guiding aspect to the movement as a whole.<ref>\nF\u00f8rland, Tor Egil. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27555682 Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215123108/https://www.jstor.org/stable/27555682 |date=2018-12-15 }}.\" Journal of American Studies 26.3 (1992): 352.

Given his immense fame due to the success of the Beatles, he was a very prominent movement figure with the constant media and press attention. Still being proactive on their honeymoon, the newlyweds controversially held a sit-in, where they sat in bed for a week answering press questions. They held numerous sit-ins, one where they first introduced their song \"Give Peace a Chance\". Lennon and Ono's song overshadowed many previous held anthems, as it became known as the ultimate anthem of peace in the 1970s, with their words \"all we are saying ... is give peace a chance\" being sung globally. \"[McCormick, Anita Louise.

On November 2, 32-year-old [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Norman Morrison]] set himself on fire in front of [[The Pentagon]]. On November 9, 22-year-old [[Catholic Worker Movement]] member [[Roger Allen LaPorte]] did the same in front of [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City. Both protests were conscious imitations of earlier (and ongoing) [[Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c|Buddhist protests]] in South Vietnam.\n\n[[File:vietnamdem.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|1967 Anti-Vietnam War demonstration at [[The Pentagon]]]]\nProtests against the Vietnam War took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The protests were part of a movement in opposition to the Vietnam War and took place mainly in the United States. (See also [[Students for a Democratic Society]], [[Free Speech Movement]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Youth International Party]], [[Chicago Seven]].)\n\nThe growing anti-war movement alarmed many in the U.S. government. On August 16, 1966 the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) began investigations of Americans who were suspected of aiding the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|NLF]], with the intent to introduce legislation making these activities illegal. Anti-war demonstrators disrupted the meeting and 50 were arrested.\n\n[[File:Demonstratie tegen oorlog in Vietnam, NATO enz. in Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 921-2506.jpg|thumb|upright|Protest against the Vietnam War in [[Amsterdam]], April 1968]]\nIn February 1967, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' published \"[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]\", an essay by [[Noam Chomsky]], one of the leading intellectual opponents of the war. In the essay Chomsky argued that much responsibility for the war lay with liberal intellectuals and technical experts who were providing what he saw as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] justification for the policies of the U.S. government. The Time Inc magazines ''Time'' and ''Life'' maintained a very pro-war editorial stance until October 1967, when in a ''volte-face'', the editor-in-chief, [[Hedley Donovan]], came out against the war.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam'' p.488-489.</ref> Donovan wrote in an editorial in ''Life'' that the United States had gone into Vietnam for \"honorable and sensible purposes\", but the war had turned out to be \"harder, longer, more complicated\" than expected.<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\">Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam'' p.489.</ref> Donovan ended his editorial by writing the war was \"not worth winning\", as South Vietnam was \"not absolutely imperative\" to maintain American interests in Asia, which made it impossible \"to ask young Americans to die for\".<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\"/>\n\nOn February 1, 1968, [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n L\u00e9m]], a [[Vietcong]] officer suspected of participating in murder of South Vietnamese government officials during the [[Tet Offensive]], was [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Loan]], the South Vietnamese National Police Chief. Loan shot L\u00e9m in the head on a public street in [[Saigon]] front of journalists. South Vietnamese reports provided as justification after the fact claimed that L\u00e9m was captured near the site of a ditch holding as many as thirty-four bound and shot bodies of police and their relatives, some of whom were the families of General Loan's deputy and close friend. The execution provided an iconic image that helped sway public opinion in the United States against the war.\n\nThe events of Tet in early 1968 as a whole were also remarkable in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as [[Walter Cronkite]], interpreted such events as the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon#Tet Offensive|attack on the American embassy]] in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness.<ref>Karnow, Stanley \"Vietnam\"</ref> The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American people that the military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.\n\nIn May 1969, ''Life'' magazine published in a single issue photographs of the faces of the roughly 250 or so American servicemen who had been killed in Vietnam during a \"routine week\" of war in the spring of 1969.<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\"/> Contrary to expectations, the issue sold out with many being haunted by the photographs of the ordinary young Americans killed.<ref name=\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam p.489\"/> On October 15, 1969, hundreds of thousands of people took part in [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|National Moratorium]] anti-war demonstrations across the United States; the demonstrations prompted many workers to call in sick from their jobs and adolescents nationwide engaged in [[truancy]] from school. About 15 million Americans took part in the demonstration of 15 October, making it the largest protests in a single day up to that point.<ref>Fountain, Aaron \"The War in the Schools: San Francisco Bay Area High Schools and the Anti\u2013Vietnam War Movement, 1965\u20131973\" p.33</ref>  A second round of \"Moratorium\" demonstrations was held on November 15 and attracted more people than the first.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam'' p.600.</ref>\n\n[[File:My Lai massacre.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|The [[My Lai massacre]] was used as an example of bad military conduct during the Vietnam War.]]\nThe U.S. realized that the South Vietnamese government needed a solid base of popular support if it were to survive the insurgency. To pursue this goal of winning the \"[[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam)|Hearts and Minds]]\" of the Vietnamese people, units of the [[United States Army]], referred to as \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" units, were used extensively for the first time since World War II.\n\nCivil Affairs units, while remaining armed and under direct military control, engaged in what came to be known as \"[[nation-building]]\": constructing (or reconstructing) schools, public buildings, roads and other [[infrastructure]]; conducting medical programs for civilians who had no access to medical facilities; facilitating cooperation among local civilian leaders; conducting hygiene and other training for civilians; and similar activities.\n\nThis policy of attempting to [[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam War)|win the hearts and minds]] of the Vietnamese people, however, often was at odds with other aspects of the war which sometimes served to antagonize many Vietnamese civilians and provided ammunition to the anti-war movement. These included the emphasis on \"[[body count]]\" as a way of measuring military success on the battlefield, civilian casualties during the bombing of villages (symbolized by journalist [[Peter Arnett]]'s famous quote, \"it was necessary to destroy the village to save it\"), and the killing of civilians in such incidents as the [[My Lai massacre]]. In 1974 the documentary [[Hearts and Minds (film)|''Hearts and Minds'']] sought to portray the devastation the war was causing to the South Vietnamese people, and won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best documentary amid considerable controversy. The South Vietnamese government also antagonized many of its citizens with its suppression of political opposition, through such measures as holding large numbers of political prisoners, torturing political opponents, and holding a [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u#Re-elected unopposed and stagnation|one-man election for President]] in 1971. Covert counter-terror programs and semi-covert ones such as the [[Phoenix Program]] attempted, with the help of anthropologists, to isolate rural South Vietnamese villages and affect the loyalty of the residents.\n\n[[File:Man wearing Purple Heart medal during Vietnam peace march, 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|This man wears a [[Purple Heart]] medal as he watches a San Francisco peace march, April 1967.]]\nDespite the increasingly depressing news of the war, many Americans continued to support President Johnson's endeavors. Aside from the domino theory mentioned above, there was a feeling that the goal of preventing a communist takeover of a pro-Western government in South Vietnam was a noble objective. Many Americans were also concerned about saving face in the event of disengaging from the war or, as President [[Richard M. Nixon]] later put it, \"achieving Peace with Honor.\" In addition, instances of Viet Cong atrocities were widely reported, most notably in an article that appeared in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in 1968 entitled ''The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh''.\n\nHowever, anti-war feelings also began to rise. Many Americans opposed the war on moral grounds, appalled by the devastation and violence of the war. Others claimed the conflict was a war against Vietnamese independence, or an intervention in a foreign [[civil war]]; others opposed it because they felt it lacked clear objectives and appeared to be unwinnable. Many anti-war activists were themselves [[Vietnam veteran]]s, as evidenced by the organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. In April 1971, thousands of these veterans converged on the White House in Washington, D.C., and hundreds of them threw their [[medal]]s and [[Military decoration|decorations]] on the steps of the [[United States Capitol]]. By this time, it had also become commonplace for the most radical anti-war demonstrators to prominently display the flag of the Viet Cong \"enemy\", an act which alienated many who were otherwise morally opposed to the war.\n\n==Political factors==\nIn 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson began his re-election campaign. [[Eugene McCarthy]] ran against him for the nomination on an anti-war platform. McCarthy did not win the first primary election in [[New Hampshire]], but he did surprisingly well against an incumbent. The resulting blow to the Johnson campaign, taken together with other factors, led the President to make a surprise announcement in a March 31 televised speech that he was pulling out of the race. He also announced the initiation of the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Negotiations]] with Vietnam in that speech. Then, on August 4, 1969, U.S. representative [[Henry Kissinger]] and North Vietnamese representative [[Xuan Thuy]] began secret peace negotiations at the apartment of French intermediary [[Jean Sainteny]] in Paris.\n\nAfter breaking with Johnson's pro-war stance, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] entered the race on March 16 and ran for the nomination on an anti-war platform. Johnson's vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], also ran for the nomination, promising to continue to support the South Vietnamese government.\n\n==Draft==\n{{Main|Draft evasion in the Vietnam War}}\n{{See also|Kent State shootings|Jackson State killings}}\n[[File:Charles DeGaulle and Ho Chi Minh are hanged in effigy during the National Shame Day celebration in Saigon, July 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Students demonstrate in [[Saigon]], July 1964, observing the tenth anniversary of the July 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Agreements]].]]\n[[File:Anti Vietnam war demonstration.

Another nineteen cards were burnt on May 22 at a demonstration following the Berkeley [[teach-in]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html |title=UC Berkeley Library Social Activism Sound Recording Project: Anti-Vietnam War Protests&nbsp;\u2013 San Francisco Bay Area |publisher=Lib.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref> Draft card protests were not aimed so much at the draft as at the immoral conduct of the war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=George Q. |title=The Draft, 1940\u20131973 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |year=1993 |series=Modern war studies |isbn=978-0-7006-0586-6 |page=175}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, only a fraction of all men of draft age were actually [[Conscription in the United States|conscripted]], but the [[Selective Service System]] office (\"Draft Board\") in each locality had broad discretion on whom to draft and whom to exempt where there was no clear guideline for exemption. In late July 1965, Johnson doubled the number of young men to be drafted per month from 17,000 to 35,000, and on August 31, signed a law making it a crime to burn a draft card.\n\nOn October 15, 1965 the student-run [[National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] in New York staged the first draft card burning to result in an arrest under the new law.\n\nIn 1967, the continued operation of a seemingly unfair draft system then calling as many as 40,000 men for induction each month fueled a burgeoning draft resistance movement. The draft favored white, middle-class men, which allowed an economically and racially discriminating draft to force young African American men to serve in rates that were disproportionately higher than the general population. Although in 1967 there was a smaller field of draft eligible black men\u201329 percent versus 63 percent of draft eligible white men\u201364 percent of black men were chosen to serve in the war through conscription, compared to only 31 percent of eligible white men.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham III|first=Herman|title=The Brothers' Vietnam War: Black Power, Manhood, and the Military Experience|year=2003|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1967, draft card turn-ins were held across the country, yielding more than 1,000 draft cards, later returned to the [[Justice Department (US)|Justice Department]] as an act of [[civil disobedience]].

Some men were rejected by the military as [[Class 1-A|4-F]] unfit for service failing to meet physical, mental, or moral standards. Still others joined the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] or entered the [[Peace Corps]] as a way of avoiding Vietnam. All of these issues raised concerns about the fairness of who got selected for involuntary service, since it was often the poor or those without connections who were drafted. Ironically, in light of modern political issues, a certain exemption was a convincing claim of [[homosexuality]], but very few men attempted this because of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] involved. Also, conviction for certain crimes earned an exclusion, the topic of the anti-war song \"[[Alice's Restaurant]]\" by [[Arlo Guthrie]].\n\nEven many of those who never received a deferment or exemption never served, simply because the pool of eligible men was so huge compared to the number required for service, that the draft boards never got around to drafting them when a new crop of men became available (until 1969) or because they had high lottery numbers (1970 and later).\n\nOf those soldiers who served during the war, there was increasing opposition to the conflict amongst GIs,<ref>\n[http://libcom.org/history/articles/vietnam-gi-resistance 1961\u20131973: GI Resistance in the Vietnam War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051020114848/http://www.libcom.org/history/articles/vietnam-gi-resistance/ |date=2005-10-20 }}, libcom.org\n</ref> which resulted in [[Frag (military)|fragging]] and many other activities which hampered the US's ability to wage war effectively.\n\nMost of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote or drink in most states, and the image of young people being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of enfranchisement or the ability to drink alcohol legally also successfully pressured legislators to lower the [[voting age]] nationally and the [[drinking age]] in many states.\n\nStudent opposition groups on many college and university campuses seized campus administration offices, and in several instances forced the expulsion of [[ROTC]] programs from the campus.\n\nSome Americans who were not subject to the draft protested the conscription of their tax dollars for the war effort. [[Tax resistance|War tax resistance]], once mostly isolated to solitary anarchists like [[Henry David Thoreau]] and religious [[pacifists]] like the [[Quakers]], became a more mainstream protest tactic. As of 1972, an estimated 200,000\u2013500,000 people were refusing to pay the excise taxes on their telephone bills, and another 20,000 were resisting part or all of their [[income tax]] bills.

The exhibit featured four large posters depicting atrocities committed by American soldiers embellished with red paint. This was followed shortly thereafter by four days of hearings on \"[[war crimes]]\" in Vietnam, which began April 25. Dellums, assisted by the [[Citizens Commission of Inquiry]],<ref name=VNA /> had called for formal investigations into the allegations, but Congress chose not to endorse these proceedings. As such, the hearings were ''ad hoc'' and only informational in nature. As a condition of room use, press and camera presence were not permitted, but the proceedings were transcribed.\n\nIn addition to [Ron Dellums] (Dem-CA), an additional 19 Congressional representatives took part in the hearings, including: [[Bella Abzug]] (Dem-NY), [[Shirley Chisholm]] (Dem-NY), [[Patsy Mink]] (Dem-HI), [[Parren Mitchell]] (Dem-MD), [[John Conyers]] (Dem-MI), [[Herman Badillo]] (Dem-NY), [[James Abourezk]] (Dem-SD), [[Leo Ryan]] (Dem-CA), [[Phil Burton]] (Dem-CA), [[Don Edwards]] (Dem-CA), [[Pete McCloskey]] (Rep-CA), [[Ed Koch]] (Dem-NY), John Seiberling (Dem-OH), [[Henry Reuss]] (Dem-WI), [[Benjamin Stanley Rosenthal]] (Dem-NY), [[Robert Kastenmeier]] (Dem-WI), and [[Abner J.

Some tactics were described as \"gruesome\", such as the severing of ears from corpses to verify body count. Others involved the killing of civilians. Soldiers claimed to have ordered [[artillery]] strikes on villages which did not appear to have any military presence. Soldiers were claimed to use racist terms such as \"gooks\", \"dinks\" and \"slant eyes\" when referring to the Vietnamese.\n\nWitnesses described that legal, by-the-book instruction was augmented by more questionable training by non-commissioned officers as to how soldiers should conduct themselves. One witness testified about \"[[free-fire area|free-fire zones]]\", areas as large as {{convert|80|sqmi|km2}} in which soldiers were free to shoot any Vietnamese they encountered after curfew without first making sure they were hostile. Allegations of exaggeration of body count, torture, murder and general abuse of civilians and the psychology and motivations of soldiers and officers were discussed at length.\n\n===Fulbright (end to war)===\n{{Main|Fulbright Hearing}}\n\nIn April and May 1971, the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], chaired by Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], held a series of 22 hearings (referred to as the [[Fulbright Hearing]]s) on proposals relating to ending the war. On the third day of the hearings, April 22, 1971, future Senator and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] became the first [[Vietnam veteran]] to testify before Congress in opposition to the war. Speaking on behalf of [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], he argued for the immediate, unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. During nearly two hours of discussions with committee members, Kerry related in some detail the findings of the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]], in which veterans had described personally committing or witnessing [[wiktionary:atrocity|atrocities]] and [[war crimes]].\n\n==Effects==\nThe opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which arguably led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States. [[Howard Zinn]], a controversial historian, states in his book ''A People's History of the United States'' that, \"in the course of the war, there developed in the United States the greatest antiwar movement the nation had ever experienced, a movement that played a critical role in bringing the war to an end.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 469</ref>\n\n===Fewer soldiers===\nThe first effect the opposition had that led to the end of the war was that fewer soldiers were available for the army. The draft was protested and even ROTC programs too. Howard Zinn first provides a note written by a student of Boston University on May 1, 1968, which stated to his draft board, \"I have absolutely no intention to report for that exam, or for induction, or to aid in any way the American war effort against the people of Vietnam ...\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''</ref> The opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 486</ref> This refusal letter soon led to an overflow of refusals ultimately leading to the event provided by Zinn stating, \"In May 1969 the Oakland induction center, where draftees reported from all of Northern California, reported that of 4,400 men ordered to report for induction, 2,400 did not show up. In the first quarter of 1970 the Selective Service System, for the first time, could not meet its quota.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fewer numbers of soldiers as an effect of the opposition to the war also can be traced to the protests against the ROTC programs in colleges. Zinn argues this by stating, \"Student protests against the ROTC resulted in the canceling of those programs in over forty colleges and universities. In 1966, 191,749 college students enrolled in ROTC. By 1973, the number was 72,459.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 491</ref> The number of ROTC students in college drastically dropped and the program lost any momentum it once had before the anti-war movement.\n\n===College campuses===\nA further effect of the opposition was that many college campuses were completely shut down due to protests. These protests led to wear on the government who tried to mitigate the tumultuous behavior and return the colleges back to normal. The colleges involved in the anti-war movement included ones such as, Brown University, Kent State University, and the University of Massachusetts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Even at The College of William and Mary unrest occurred with protests by the students and even some faculty members that resulted in \"multiple informants\" hired to report to the CIA on the activities of students and faculty members.<ref>David McCarthy, \"'The Sun Never Sets on the Activities of the CIA': Project Resistance at William and Mary\"</ref> At the University of Massachusetts, \"The 100th Commencement of the University of Massachusetts yesterday was a protest, a call for peace\", \"Red fists of protest, white peace symbols, and blue doves were stenciled on black academic gowns, and nearly every other senior wore an armband representing a plea for peace.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''  Page 491</ref> Additionally, \"At Boston College, a Catholic institution, six thousand people gathered that evening in the gymnasium to denounce the war.\"<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''   Page 490</ref> At Kent State University, \"on May 4, when students gathered to demonstrate against the war, National Guardsmen fired into the crowd. Four students were killed.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 490</ref> Finally, \"At the Brown University commencement in 1969, two-thirds of the graduating class turned their backs when Henry Kissinger stood up to address them.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Basically, from all of the evidence here provided by the historians, Zinn and McCarthy, the second effect was very prevalent and it was the uproar at many colleges and universities as an effect of the opposition to the United States' involvement in Vietnam.\n\n===American soldiers===\nAnother effect the opposition to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them.<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''  Page 496</ref> The statement of one of the soldiers reads,\n\n<blockquote>Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me.<ref>Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 496</ref></blockquote>\n\nHoward Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.\n\n==Timeline==\n{{See also|Lists of protests against the Vietnam War}}\n\n===1964===\n[[File:Demonstrators against the war in Vietnam holding signs on the boardwalk during the 1964 Democratic National Convention (cropped1).jpg|thumb|Demonstrators against the Vietnam War holding signs on the boardwalk during the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]]]\n*On May 12, twelve young men in New York publicly [[Draft-card burning|burned their draft cards]] to protest the war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=George Q. |title=The Draft, 1940\u20131973 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |year=1993 |series=Modern war studies |isbn=978-0700605866 |page=175}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Sherry Gershon |title=Hell no, we won't go!: resisting the draft during the Vietnam War |publisher=Viking |year=1991 |page=xix |quote=1964: May 12\u2014Twelve students at a New York rally burn their draft cards ... |isbn=978-0670839353 |url=https://archive.org/details/hellnowewontgore0000gott }}</ref>\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 Prompted by the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]].\n*In December 1964, [[Joan Baez]] leads six hundred people in an antiwar demonstration in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book|title=An American Ordeal: The Antiwar Movement of the Vietnam Era|url=https://archive.org/details/americanordealan00debe|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, New York|last1=DeBenedetti|first1=Charles|last2=Chatfield|first2=Charles}}</ref>\n\n===1965===\n*On March 24, organized by professors against the war at the [[University of Michigan]], a [[teach-in]] protest was attended by 2,500 participants.

Early in the morning before the march, [[Richard Nixon's visit to the Lincoln Memorial|Nixon met with protesters]] at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] but nothing was resolved and the protest went on as planned.\n* [[Student Strike of 1970|National Student Strike]]: more than 450 university, college and high school campuses across the country were shut by student strikes and both violent and non-violent protests that involved more than 4 million students, in the only nationwide student strike in U.S. history.\n* A Gallup poll in May shows that 56% of the public believed that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake, 61% of those over 50 expressed that belief compared to 49% of those between the ages of 21\u201329.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/commentary/?analysisid=57 |title=Pew Research Center: Generations Divide Over Military Action in Iraq |publisher=People-press.org |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref>\n* On June 13, President Nixon established the [[President's Commission on Campus Unrest]].

The festival, arranged by the People's Army Jamboree (an ''[[ad hoc]]'' group) and Oregon governor [[Tom McCall]], was set up when the FBI told the governor that President Nixon's planned appearance at an [[American Legion]] convention in Portland could lead to violence worse than that seen at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago.\n* The [[Chicano Moratorium]]: on August 29, some 25,000 [[Mexican-American]]s participated in the largest anti-war demonstration in Los Angeles.

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-bless-the-harts-season-one/|title=Season Review: 'Bless the Harts' Season 1|last=Kaldor|first=David|accessdate=April 18, 2020|date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent critic of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] animated comedies like ''[[Family Guy]]'', gave the first episode a negative review, citing \"This tells potential viewers everything they need to know about the show...except for the tasteless appearances of a beer-swilling Jesus who appears in person to mock Jenny at her restaurant, the Last Supper. In the past, Fox has been the TV capital of adult animation. 'The Simpsons' is a mainstay of television (indeed, now holds the record for the longest-running prime-time series in TV history); 'Bob\u2019s Burgers' is consistently amusing; and even 'Family Guy', repugnant though it is, manages a clever joke or one-liner once in a blue moon. But Bless The Harts is just plain lazy. It is clear the show\u2019s creators believe that tired \u201cSouthern redneck\u201d cliches ripped off from 'King of the Hill', plentiful profanity, and a little of the absurdity of the late, unlamented Son of Zorn (which, not coincidentally, was produced by the same team as 'Bless The Harts') are sufficient to entertain audiences, with any effort in the way of genuine characterization or comedy being superfluous. Judging by the first episode, this entire program is a waste of time. The artwork is shoddy, the cutaways nonsensical, and the script is totally lacking in humor. And while the program does boast voiceover talent by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, such talent is utterly wasted when the characters are given nothing funny to say. Using talented voice artists on this dreck is like putting a silk bow on a cowpie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parentstv.org/blog/bless-the-harts-because-no-one-else-will|title='Bless the Harts'

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-bless-the-harts-season-one/|title=Season Review: 'Bless the Harts' Season 1|last=Kaldor|first=David|accessdate=18 April 2020|date=20 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent critic of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] animated comedies like ''[[Family Guy]]'', gave the first episode a negative review, citing \"This tells potential viewers everything they need to know about the show...except for the tasteless appearances of a beer-swilling Jesus who appears in person to mock Jenny at her restaurant, the Last Supper. In the past, Fox has been the TV capital of adult animation. 'The Simpsons' is a mainstay of television (indeed, now holds the record for the longest-running prime-time series in TV history); 'Bob\u2019s Burgers' is consistently amusing; and even 'Family Guy', repugnant though it is, manages a clever joke or one-liner once in a blue moon. But Bless The Harts is just plain lazy. It is clear the show\u2019s creators believe that tired \u201cSouthern redneck\u201d cliches ripped off from 'King of the Hill', plentiful profanity, and a little of the absurdity of the late, unlamented Son of Zorn (which, not coincidentally, was produced by the same team as 'Bless The Harts') are sufficient to entertain audiences, with any effort in the way of genuine characterization or comedy being superfluous. Judging by the first episode, this entire program is a waste of time. The artwork is shoddy, the cutaways nonsensical, and the script is totally lacking in humor. And while the program does boast voiceover talent by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, such talent is utterly wasted when the characters are given nothing funny to say. Using talented voice artists on this dreck is like putting a silk bow on a cowpie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parentstv.org/blog/bless-the-harts-because-no-one-else-will|title='Bless the Harts'

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

David Kirby, writing in ''The New York Times Book Review'' notes that, \"It isn't long before the ethereal quality of these poems begins to remind you of similar effects in the work of T.S.

His critical essays have appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.\n\nIn 2008, [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] published ''As a Friend,'' Gander's novel of a gifted man, a land surveyor, whose impact on those around him provokes an atmosphere of intense self-examination and  eroticism.

Seaver Professor Emeritus of Literary Arts & Comparative Literature at [[Brown University]], Gander won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 2019 for ''Be With'', and is chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. \n\n==Life==\nBorn in the [[Mojave Desert]] as James Forrest Cockerille III, Forrest Gander grew up in Virginia where he and his two sisters were raised by their single mother, an elementary school teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordite.org.au/interviews/magee-gander/|title=Paul Magee Interviews Forrest Gander|date=31 July 2014|website=Cordite.org.au|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> The four shared a two-room apartment in Annandale; Gander's estranged father ran The Mod Scene, a bar on Bleecker St. in Greenwich Village, NY.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/|title=Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series. Encyclopedia.com. 19 Jan. 2019}}</ref> With his mother and sisters, Gander began to travel extensively on summer road trips around the United States. The traveling, which never stopped, came to inform his interest in landscapes, languages, and cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/media/avfiles/poet-poem-gander-bringhurst.mp3|title=The Poet and the Poem Audio Podcast.

His work has been linked to [[ecopoetics]] and ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edgeeffects.net/keller-ecopoetics-anthropocene//|title=Recomposing Ecopoetics: North American Poetry of the Self-Conscious Anthropocene University of Virginia Press, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA writer in multiple genres, Gander is noted for his many collaborations with other artists, including Eiko and Koma.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Laverne|first=Firth|date=2013|title=Book Review of Eiko and Koma|url=https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/eiko-and-koma|journal=New York Journal of Books|volume=|pages=|via=New York Journal of Books}}</ref> He is a [[United States Artists]] [[Rockefeller fellow|Rockefeller Fellow]] and the recipient of fellowships from the [[Library of Congress]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]], [[Whiting Awards|The Whiting Foundation]], and the Howard Foundation. In 2017, he was elected as a Chancellor to the [[Academy of American Poets]] and in 2019, he was awarded [[The Pulitzer Prize]] in poetry.\n\nHe taught at [[Providence College]] and at [[Harvard University]] before becoming the Adele Kellenberg Seaver Professor of Literary Arts and Comparative Literatures at [[Brown University]] in [[Rhode Island]]. Gander was married to the poet [[CD Wright]]. Together they raised a son, the artist-craftsman Brecht Wright Gander. Her sudden death in 2016 precipitated Gander's book ''Be With.''\n\nHe lives now in Petaluma, CA with artist [[Ashwini Bhat]].\n\n\n==Writing and translation==\n[[File:Forrest Gander by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Gander speaking at an event in Phoenix, Arizona in March 2017.]]\nHis poetry is lyrical, but often complex rhythmically and structurally. David Kirby, writing in ''The New York Times Book Review'' notes that, \"It isn't long before the ethereal quality of these poems begins to remind you of similar effects in the work of T.S. Eliot and the 17th century Anglo-Welsh mystic Henry Vaughan....In the midst of such questioning, the only reality is the poet's unflinchingly curious mind.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=David|title=Torn Awake|journal=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=January 20, 2002}}</ref> Noting the frequency and particularity of Gander's references to ecology and landscape, [[Robert Hass]], former U.S. [[Poet Laureate]], calls him \"a Southern poet of a relatively rare kind, a restlessly experimental writer.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hass|first1=Robert|title=Book World|journal=The Washington Post|date=May 2, 1999}}</ref> Gander's book ''Core Samples from the World'' was a finalist for 2012 [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the 2011 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]. The Pulitzer citation notes that ''Core Samples from the World'' is \"A compelling work that explores cross-cultural tensions in the world and digs deeply to identify what is essential in human experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Poetry|title=Category : Journalism|website=Pulitzer.org|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> With Australian poet-activist [[John Kinsella (poet)|John Kinsella]], Gander wrote the cross-genre book ''Redstart: an Ecological Poetics.'' \n\n''Be With'', published in 2018 by [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]], was awarded the 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize]] in poetry and was longlisted for the 2018 [[National Book Award]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndbooks.com/author/forrest-gander/|title=Forrest Gander, New Directions|last=|first=|date=2019|website=https://www.ndbooks.com/author/forrest-gander/|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> It is an [[elegiac]] collection of poetry and testament to his grief over the death of his wife.

His critical essays have appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.\n\nIn 2008, [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] published ''As a Friend,'' Gander's novel of a gifted man, a land surveyor, whose impact on those around him provokes an atmosphere of intense self-examination and  eroticism. In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Jeanette Winterson praised ''As a Friend'' as \"a strange and beautiful novel.... haunting and haunted.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Winterson|first1=Jeanette|title=A Death in Full|journal=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=December 19, 2008}}</ref> ''As a Friend'' has been published in translation in Bulgarian, Spanish, French, Turkish, and German editions. In 2014, [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] released Gander's second novel ''The Trace,'' about a couple who, researching the last journey of Civil War writer Ambrose Bierce, find themselves lost in the Chihuahua Desert. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it a \"carefully crafted novel of intimacy and isolation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Denhoed|first1=Andrea|title=Books to Watch Out For: November|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 4, 2014}}</ref> And in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', Robyn Creswell commented that \"Gander\u2019s landscapes are lyrical and precise (\"raw gashed mountains, gnarly buttes of andesite\"), and his study of a marriage on the rocks is as empathetic as it is unsparing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Creswell|first1=Robyn|title=Staff Picks|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/12/05/staff-picks-reading-aloud-rayon-dresses-red-phones/|publisher=The Paris Review}}</ref>\\\n\nGander is a translator who has edited several anthologies of poetry from Spain, Mexico, and Latin America. In addition, Gander has translated distinct volumes by Mexican poets Pura L\u00f3pez Colom\u00e9, [[Coral Bracho]] (for which he was a [[PEN Translation Prize]] finalist for ''Firefly Under the Tongue''), Valerie Mejer Caso, and Alfonso D'Aquino, another poet connected with [[ecopoetry]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forrestgander.com/books%20translations/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407113803/http://forrestgander.com/books%20translations/index.html |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> With Kyoko Yoshida, Gander translated [http://www.omnidawn.com/products-page/current/spectacle-pigsty-kiwao-nomura-tr-gander-yoshida ''Spectacle & Pigsty: Selected Poems of [[Kiwao Nomura]]'' (OmniDawn, 2011)], winner of the 2012 [[Best Translated Book Award]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/shse/2012-05-15/spectacle-and-pigsty-sweeps-the-best-translated-book-of-poetry-2012-award|title=Spectacle and Pigsty sweeps the Best Translated Book of Poetry 2012 Award - @ Shambaugh House|website=Iwp.uiowa.edu|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> in 2016, New Directions published ''Alice Iris Red Horse'', selected poems of [[Yoshimasu Gozo]], edited by Gander.

Not every move has to form a line of three, but each time a line is formed during a move, a tick will add up to the multiplier bar where every time the bar is filled, the multiplier increases by 1, which multiplies the points earned by matching gems. The multiplier tick bar will be emptied if a move is made which does not line up three or more gems. If the same is done when the bar is empty, the multiplier decreases by 1. The Multiplier maxes out at X10. In all modes but Challenge, there is also a bonus optional mini-challenge that the player can complete by matching the displayed gems in order. Completing the mini-challenge will award the play extra ticks, and will clear one bad gem from the screen (or when there aren't any, more ticks are awarded.) There are several different [[game mode|modes of gameplay]] available.\n\n===Classic===\nThe player attempts to match gems together, and the resulting matches contribute to a level up bar at the left of the screen. When the bar is filled, the player is warped onward to the next level. The game ends when an active Bomb Gem or Doom Gem counts down to zero and the disarm spinner lands on a skull, at which point the game board and the spaceship are destroyed, and the game ends. This is the only mode available in the DSiware version of the game apart from the DS-exclusive Battle Mode. Also, Bomb Gems appear on level 2 and start out with a counter of 20. Every time you level up, it decreases by 1.\n\n===Zen===\nZen Mode is similar to Classic Mode, but do not include Bomb, locked, or Doom gems, therefore it continues endlessly and the player can never lose. This mode does still have Coal for extra bonuses. This mode is intended for beginners and for those who want a more relaxed pace of gameplay.\n\n===Challenge===\nChallenge is unlocked when the player gets to Rank 3 (Rotator).\n\nChallenge Mode is made up of several different challenges. On each planet, the player is given a specific challenge to complete. In the PC and Mac versions, all the planets at the start (except Detonator) are locked. When at least the first challenge on a planet is completed, the next planet is unlocked. Every time a challenge is completed, the player is given stars. Each planet has seven challenges that increase in difficulty. After completing the seventh challenge, the planet's challenge turns into an Eclipse Mode, where the player is given the task to make the highest objective possible in 3 minutes (except for Stratamax and Survivor). There are 13 planets to clear.\n\n===Blitz===\nBlitz is unlocked when Level 10 in Classic Mode is completed for the first time. This mode is unlocked at the beginning in the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] version.\n\n''[[Bejeweled Blitz|Blitz]]'' is the new name for the original ''[[Bejeweled]]'' game's timed mode. The gameplay is the same as in Classic Mode, but with a time limit of five minutes to amass as many points as possible. In the web version, the time limit is three minutes. The game ends when a Bomb Gem counts down to zero, or when time runs out. As the game progresses, the announcer will alert the player how much time remains, starting at one-minute intervals, then thirty seconds, and finally at ten seconds, where a countdown can be heard.\n\n=== Battle ===\nBattle Mode is exclusive to the Nintendo DS and DSiWare versions of the game. It is identical to Classic Mode, but with differences from said mode. It lets the player battle against another player. The player sends bombs to the other player's board by making 6 consecutive matches. The player attempt to fill up a \"tug-of-war\" tube to win the match. The player who fills the battle tube first wins. The player levels up their spaceship after winning matches.\n\n==Gems==\nNormal gems come in eight different colors and shapes such as [[Square (geometry)|square]]-shaped [[ruby|rubies]], [[rhombus]]-shaped [[topaz]]es, [[sphere]]-shaped [[diamond]]s, decagonal [[emerald]]s, [[crystal]]-shaped [[sapphire]]s, [[triangle]]-shaped [[amethyst]]s and [[hexagon]]-shaped [[tourmaline]].\n\n=== Special Gems ===\nThese are in different forms, and they can be created by matching more than 3 gems in a row, or in different conditions.\n\n==== Flame Gem ====\nFlame Gems are created when 4 gems on a straight line, a T, a +, or an L-shaped line of gems are matched. It appears as a gem surrounded with fire. When matched or detonated, it dentonates and eliminates gems in a 3x3 square.\n\n==== Lightning Gem ====\nLightning Gems are created when 5 gems are matched in a row. It appears as a gem full of electricity. When matched or detonated, it destroys all the gems on its row and column.\n\n==== Supernova Gem ====\nSupernova Gems are created when 6 or more gems are matched in a straight line. This can only be created by a cascade. It appears as a burning electric gem. When matched or detonated, it destroys three rows and columns of gems from where the gem was detonated. It can be seen as a combination of a Flame and Lightning Gem.\n\n==== Fruit Gem ====\nFruit Gems are created when maxing out the x10 Multiplier twice. The multiplier does not upgrade after the 10th multiplier. Instead, when the multiplier is filled and the player makes another match, a yellow tick will turn into a rainbow tick. When all the rainbow ticks are filled, the multiplier bar shoots out a beam that turns any bad gem (ex: the bomb with the lowest number) into a Fruit Gem. If there are no Bad Gems, a random gem on the board is turned into a Fruit Gem. When matched or detonated, the Fruit Gem shoots out 3 rings of pulse energy that makes all the gems of its color shake and adds ticks to the bombs, and the 4th ring destroys all the gems of the Fruit Gem's color, as well as any locking gems and Lock gems. Any other Fruit Gems cleared due to having the same color as the Fruit Gem that was matched acts like a Flame Gem instead. The Fruit Gem also adds 10 extra ticks to any leftover Bomb Gems or Doom Gems. After that, the bonus turns into a Mega Fruit Bonus. When the Mega Fruit Bonus is completed, fruits will dance on the screen and give the player a big score bonus, and after the bonus, another fruit gem will appear on the board. Fruit Gems do not affect Locking Doom Gems. Its result is similar to a Hypercube.\n\n=== Coal ===\nCoal gems appear randomly. Coal can't be matched, but when it is destroyed by the explosion of a Flame, Lightning, or Supernova Gem, it breaks open, geodes pop out from the coal and each geode that appears give a score bonus. There is an easter egg, when the player types in \"snackers\" on the keyboard with their cursor off the board in the PC version, all the coal will become the face of Snackers, PopCap co-founder and Bejeweled creator Jason Kapalka's cat.\n\n=== Removed Special Gems ===\nThese are gems not seen normally in-game, but can be placed on the board by modifying the game's files. These were likely concepts, but were taken down later in development.\n\n==== Ice Gems ====\nThe gem would be created by matching 5 gems in an X formation.\n\nIt could stop Bomb and Doom Gems from counting down as well as stopping the Chain Meter from decreasing.\n\nIt still allows time to continue ticking down in timed modes though.\n\n==== Skull Gems ====\nThe notification that appears when an Ice Gem is seen for the first time would have been the only one in Bejeweled Twist that highlights the name of the gem with lavender text color.\n\nWhenever a move is performed while under the effects of an Ice Gem, the Gem Rotator emits small bursts of sparkles as it spins.\n\nWhen matching an Ice Gem, The background turns blue and the music will pause itself until the Ice effect disappears.\n\nThe ice effect lasts for 4 moves but the player can make it last longer by matching more Ice Gems.\n\nThis would have been the only type of match in the Bejeweled franchise that does not require a line of gems to be made.\n\nIt is possible to re-enable the Ice Gem by modifying the game's files, but the Ice Yem will only work in Challenge Mode.\n\n==== Angel Gems ====\nThis is the rarest Special gem in the game that is created by making a + match with 5 gems and it will remove all bad gems onscreen. When the game is hacked and an Angel Gem is matched in-game, the game crashes, as it was not coded before it was scrapped. When players restart the game, the gems remain in the arrangement just before the Angel Gem is cleared.\n\n=== Bad Gems ===\nThe gems over here give obstacles for the player and can end the game. None of these bad gems appear in Zen Mode. At the end of every level in Classic mode, all the bad gems are destroyed.\n\n=== Bomb Gems ===\nThis is the most dangerous gem in the game. These gems appear starting at Level 2 in Classic mode, and instantly in Blitz Mode.\n\nThe gem appears as a gem with a mine. Every time a twist is made, the number on the bomb goes down by 1. On later levels, they start with a lower number. Starting at level 15, Bomb Gems have their timers start at 7 whenever they enter the board. The player must clear the Bomb Gems before the bomb timer reaches 0. When the bomb timer reaches 8, the bomb starts to emit smoke, the number flashes red, and the bomb starts shaking. When the bomb timer reaches 5, the bomb plays a sound every time a twist is made, giving a warning, and the music adds some extra instruments and plays faster. In Classic Mode, if the Bomb Gem reaches 0, the Disarm Spinner appears. In Blitz mode, should a Bomb Gem reach 0, the game immediately ends.\n\nAccording to evidence found inside the game files of Bejeweled Twist, it seems that Bomb Gems were originally known as Counter Gems.\n\nIf players use a Fruit Gem to extend a Bomb Gem by 10 moves, it is possible for the number of moves on it to go over 20.\n\nIt is possible to modify one of the XMLs to change the default number of moves on the Bomb Gem, and/or not make it count down one move when starting the next level. One instance where it will be achieved is by changing the number of moves to 35.\n\nThe highest possible number of moves that can be on a Bomb Gem, if extended by hacking, is 2,147,483,647; if extended by a Fruit Gem, the number on the bomb will just flash red (as it does when the bomb ticks down to 8 moves) and it will not count down any further with any move.\n\n===== Disarm Spinner =====\nWhen a bomb hits 0, the Disarm Spinner appears, giving the player one last chance to destroy the bomb. A wheel of 8 gems will appear, but 2 gems will immediately turn into Skulls. The wheel will then start spinning, and the player must click on \"Click to Stop\" (or touch to stop) to stop spinning the wheel.\n\nIf the spinner lands on the pair of gems, the bomb will match with the gems, disarming the bomb. 6 more ticks will also be added to any remaining Bomb and Doom Gems.\n\nIf the spinner lands on the pair of skulls, the bomb will ignite, and explode, destroying the spaceship, the board, and the planet cube, and the game ends.\n\nEach time a bomb hits 0, two more pairs will turn into skulls until one pair of gems is left. The Disarm Spinner doesn't appear in Blitz mode, so if a bomb hits 0, it instantly explodes and the game ends.\n\nThe Disarm Spinner doesn't affect Doom Gems.\n\n=== Locked Gems ===\nThese gems start appearing in level 4 in Classic mode, but in later levels, they appear more frequently. It doesn't appear in Blitz mode, but they appear in the Challenge Mode's challenge planet, Survivor.\n\nAt a random point, a lock will appear over a gem. If the gem isn't matched in the next move, it will turn into a locked gem. A Locked Gem can't be twisted, but it can still be matched to destroy the lock.\n\n=== Doom Gems ===\nThese deadly gems start appearing at level 13 in Classic. Like Locked Gems, they don't appear in Blitz mode. However, Doom Gems do appear in the challenge modes Survivor and Chain Reaction (only in Eclipse mode).\n\nAt a random point, like a Locked Gem, a slightly larger lock with small spikes and purple vapor will appear over a gem. If the gem isn't matched after the next move, it becomes a Doom Gem.\n\nDoom Gems are a unique combination of a Coal, Bomb, and Locked Gem. Like Coals, they can't be matched. They tick down like Bomb Gems, but only after matchless moves. Like Locked Gems, they can't be moved. Only one Doom Gem appears on the board at a time. The gem has a countdown number like a Bomb Gem. If the Doom Gem's number hits 0, it instantly explodes with no chance to disarm it, and the game ends. It cannot be moved or matched, and the Doom Gem can only be destroyed by the explosion of a Flame, Lightning, or Supernova Gem.\n\nIn Classic Mode, the lowest starting number for a Doom Gem is 9. Only one Doom Gem appears per level starting at level 13.\n\nIn Survivor mode, the Doom Gem is set to a counter of 20, whereas in Eclipse, the Doom Gem is instead set to a counter of 15.\n\nIn Chain Reaction (only Eclipse mode), the Doom Gem is set to a counter of 1 to make the challenge more difficult.\n\nThe notification that appears when a Doom Gem is seen for the first time is the only one in the game that highlights the name of the gem with red text color. Unlike Locking Gems, Locking Doom Gems do not a have a unique mouseover description.\n\nThe sound of a Doom Gem exploding is slightly different from that of a Bomb Gem. The animation slows down a little bit whenever a Doom Gem is destroyed, similar to Coal Gems. Similar to Bomb Gems, the number displayed on the front of a Doom Gem has a colored outline: red-violet. According to early screenshots of Bejeweled Twist, the color of the number displayed on the front of a Doom Gem was originally violet and the outline of the number was bright gray. According to evidence found inside the game files of Bejeweled Twist, it seems that Doom Gems were originally known as Devil Gems. Although Doom Gems do not appear in Bejeweled Blitz and Bejeweled 3, graphics of them can be found inside the game files of those games.\n\nThe sound of the Doom Gem ticking down is the same as the sound heard in Bejeweled 3 when a new Bomb Gem appears on the screen.

Not every move has to form a line of three, but each time a line is formed during a move, a tick will add up to the multiplier bar where every time the bar is filled, the multiplier increases by 1, which multiplies the points earned by matching gems. The multiplier tick bar will be emptied if a move is made which does not line up three or more gems. If the same is done when the bar is empty, the multiplier decreases by 1. The Multiplier maxes out at X10. In all modes but Challenge, there is also a bonus optional mini-challenge that the player can complete by matching the displayed gems in order. Completing the mini-challenge will award the play extra ticks, and will clear one bad gem from the screen (or when there aren't any, more ticks are awarded.) There are several different [[game mode|modes of gameplay]] available.\n\n===Classic===\nThe player attempts to match gems together, and the resulting matches contribute to a level up bar at the left of the screen. When the bar is filled, the player is warped onward to the next level. The game ends when an active Bomb Gem or Doom Gem counts down to zero and the disarm spinner lands on a skull, at which point the game board and the spaceship are destroyed, and the game ends. This is the only mode available in the DSiware version of the game apart from the DS-exclusive Battle Mode.\n\n===Zen===\nZen Mode is similar to Classic Mode, but do not include Bomb, locked, or Doom gems, therefore it continues endlessly and the player can never lose. This mode does still have Coal for extra bonuses. This mode is intended for beginners and for those who want a more relaxed pace of gameplay.\n\n===Challenge===\nChallenge is unlocked when the player gets to Rank 3 (Rotator).\n\nChallenge Mode is made up of several different challenges. On each planet, the player is given a specific challenge to complete. In the PC and Mac versions, all the planets at the start (except Detonator) are locked. When at least the first challenge on a planet is completed, the next planet is unlocked. Every time a challenge is completed, the player is given stars. Each planet has seven challenges that increase in difficulty. After completing the seventh challenge, the planet's challenge turns into an Eclipse Mode, where the player is given the task to make the highest objective possible in 3 minutes (except for Stratamax and Survivor). There are 13 planets to clear.\n\n===Blitz===\nBlitz is unlocked when Level 10 in Classic Mode is completed for the first time. This mode is unlocked at the beginning in the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] version.\n\n''[[Bejeweled Blitz|Blitz]]'' is the new name for the original ''[[Bejeweled]]'' game's timed mode. The gameplay is the same as in Classic Mode, but with a time limit of five minutes to amass as many points as possible. In the web version, the time limit is three minutes. The game ends when a Bomb Gem counts down to zero, or when time runs out. As the game progresses, the announcer will alert the player how much time remains, starting at one-minute intervals, then thirty seconds, and finally at ten seconds, where a countdown can be heard.\n\n=== Battle ===\nBattle Mode is exclusive to the Nintendo DS and DSiWare versions of the game. It is identical to Classic Mode, but with differences from said mode. It lets the player battle against another player. The player sends bombs to the other player's board by making 6 consecutive matches. The player attempt to fill up a \"tug-of-war\" tube to win the match. The player who fills the battle tube first wins. The player levels up their spaceship after winning matches.\n\n==Gems==\nNormal gems come in eight different colors and shapes such as [[Square (geometry)|square]]-shaped [[ruby|rubies]], [[rhombus]]-shaped [[topaz]]es, [[sphere]]-shaped [[diamond]]s, decagonal [[emerald]]s, [[crystal]]-shaped [[sapphire]]s, [[triangle]]-shaped [[amethyst]]s and [[hexagon]]-shaped [[tourmaline]].\n\n=== Special Gems ===\nThese are in different forms, and they can be created by matching more than 3 gems in a row, or in different conditions.\n\n==== Flame Gem ====\nFlame Gems are created when 4 gems on a straight line, a T, a +, or an L-shaped line of gems are matched. It appears as a gem surrounded with fire. When matched or detonated, it dentonates and eliminates gems in a 3x3 square.\n\n==== Lightning Gem ====\nLightning Gems are created when 5 gems are matched in a row. It appears as a gem full of electricity. When matched or detonated, it destroys all the gems on its row and column.\n\n==== Supernova Gem ====\nSupernova Gems are created when 6 or more gems are matched in a straight line. This can only be created by a cascade. It appears as a burning electric gem. When matched or detonated, it destroys three rows and columns of gems from where the gem was detonated. It can be seen as a combination of a Flame and Lightning Gem.\n\n==== Fruit Gem ====\nFruit Gems are created when maxing out the x10 Multiplier twice. The multiplier does not upgrade after the 10th multiplier. Instead, when the multiplier is filled and the player makes another match, a yellow tick will turn into a rainbow tick. When all the rainbow ticks are filled, the multiplier bar shoots out a beam that turns any bad gem (ex: the bomb with the lowest number) into a Fruit Gem. If there are no Bad Gems, a random gem on the board is turned into a Fruit Gem. When matched or detonated, the Fruit Gem shoots out 3 rings of pulse energy that makes all the gems of its color shake and adds ticks to the bombs, and the 4th ring destroys all the gems of the Fruit Gem's color, as well as any locking gems and Lock gems. Any other Fruit Gems cleared due to having the same color as the Fruit Gem that was matched acts like a Flame Gem instead. The Fruit Gem also adds 10 extra ticks to any leftover Bomb Gems or Doom Gems. After that, the bonus turns into a Mega Fruit Bonus. When the Mega Fruit Bonus is completed, fruits will dance on the screen and give the player a big score bonus, and after the bonus, another fruit gem will appear on the board. Fruit Gems do not affect Locking Doom Gems. Its result is similar to a Hypercube.\n\n=== Coal ===\nCoal gems appear randomly. Coal can't be matched, but when it is destroyed by the explosion of a Flame, Lightning, or Supernova Gem, it breaks open, geodes pop out from the coal and each geode that appears give a score bonus. There is an easter egg, when the player types in \"snackers\" on the keyboard with their cursor off the board in the PC version, all the coal will become the face of Snackers, PopCap co-founder and Bejeweled creator Jason Kapalka's cat.\n\n=== Removed Special Gems ===\nThese are gems not seen normally in-game, but can be placed on the board by modifying the game's files. These were likely concepts, but were taken down later in development.\n\n==== Ice Gems ====\nThe gem would be created by matching 5 gems in an X formation.\n\nIt could stop Bomb and Doom Gems from counting down as well as stopping the Chain Meter from decreasing.\n\nIt still allows time to continue ticking down in timed modes though.\n\n==== Skull Gems ====\nThe notification that appears when an Ice Gem is seen for the first time would have been the only one in Bejeweled Twist that highlights the name of the gem with lavender text color.\n\nWhenever a move is performed while under the effects of an Ice Gem, the Gem Rotator emits small bursts of sparkles as it spins.\n\nWhen matching an Ice Gem, The background turns blue and the music will pause itself until the Ice effect disappears.\n\nThe ice effect lasts for 4 moves but the player can make it last longer by matching more Ice Gems.\n\nThis would have been the only type of match in the Bejeweled franchise that does not require a line of gems to be made.\n\nIt is possible to re-enable the Ice Gem by modifying the game's files, but the Ice Yem will only work in Challenge Mode.\n\n==== Angel Gems ====\nThis is the rarest Special gem in the game that is created by making a + match with 5 gems and it will remove all bad gems onscreen. When the game is hacked and an Angel Gem is matched in-game, the game crashes, as it was not coded before it was scrapped. When players restart the game, the gems remain in the arrangement just before the Angel Gem is cleared.\n\n=== Bad Gems ===\nThe gems over here give obstacles for the player and can end the game. None of these bad gems appear in Zen Mode. At the end of every level in Classic mode, all the bad gems are destroyed.\n\n=== Bomb Gems ===\nThis is the most dangerous gem in the game. These gems appear starting at Level 2 in Classic mode, and instantly in Blitz Mode.\n\nThe gem appears as a gem with a mine. Every time a twist is made, the number on the bomb goes down by 1. On later levels, they start with a lower number. Starting at level 15, Bomb Gems have their timers start at 7 whenever they enter the board. The player must clear the Bomb Gems before the bomb timer reaches 0. When the bomb timer reaches 8, the bomb starts to emit smoke, the number flashes red, and the bomb starts shaking. When the bomb timer reaches 5, the bomb plays a sound every time a twist is made, giving a warning, and the music adds some extra instruments and plays faster. In Classic Mode, if the Bomb Gem reaches 0, the Disarm Spinner appears. In Blitz mode, should a Bomb Gem reach 0, the game immediately ends.\n\nAccording to evidence found inside the game files of Bejeweled Twist, it seems that Bomb Gems were originally known as Counter Gems.\n\nIf players use a Fruit Gem to extend a Bomb Gem by 10 moves, it is possible for the number of moves on it to go over 20.\n\nIt is possible to modify one of the XMLs to change the default number of moves on the Bomb Gem, and/or not make it count down one move when starting the next level. One instance where it will be achieved is by changing the number of moves to 35.\n\nThe highest possible number of moves that can be on a Bomb Gem, if extended by hacking, is 2,147,483,647; if extended by a Fruit Gem, the number on the bomb will just flash red (as it does when the bomb ticks down to 8 moves) and it will not count down any further with any move.\n\n===== Disarm Spinner =====\nWhen a bomb hits 0, the Disarm Spinner appears, giving the player one last chance to destroy the bomb. A wheel of 8 gems will appear, but 2 gems will immediately turn into Skulls. The wheel will then start spinning, and the player must click on \"Click to Stop\" (or touch to stop) to stop spinning the wheel.\n\nIf the spinner lands on the pair of gems, the bomb will match with the gems, disarming the bomb. 6 more ticks will also be added to any remaining Bomb and Doom Gems.\n\nIf the spinner lands on the pair of skulls, the bomb will ignite, and explode, destroying the spaceship, the board, and the planet cube, and the game ends.\n\nEach time a bomb hits 0, two more pairs will turn into skulls until one pair of gems is left. The Disarm Spinner doesn't appear in Blitz mode, so if a bomb hits 0, it instantly explodes and the game ends.\n\nThe Disarm Spinner doesn't affect Doom Gems.\n\n=== Locked Gems ===\nThese gems start appearing in level 4 in Classic mode, but in later levels, they appear more frequently. It doesn't appear in Blitz mode, but they appear in the Challenge Mode's challenge planet, Survivor.\n\nAt a random point, a lock will appear over a gem. If the gem isn't matched in the next move, it will turn into a locked gem. A Locked Gem can't be twisted, but it can still be matched to destroy the lock.\n\n=== Doom Gems ===\nThese deadly gems start appearing at level 13 in Classic. Like Locked Gems, they don't appear in Blitz mode. However, Doom Gems do appear in the challenge modes Survivor and Chain Reaction (only in Eclipse mode).\n\nAt a random point, like a Locked Gem, a slightly larger lock with small spikes and purple vapor will appear over a gem. If the gem isn't matched after the next move, it becomes a Doom Gem.\n\nDoom Gems are a unique combination of a Coal, Bomb, and Locked Gem. Like Coals, they can't be matched. They tick down like Bomb Gems, but only after matchless moves. Like Locked Gems, they can't be moved. Only one Doom Gem appears on the board at a time. The gem has a countdown number like a Bomb Gem. If the Doom Gem's number hits 0, it instantly explodes with no chance to disarm it, and the game ends. It cannot be moved or matched, and the Doom Gem can only be destroyed by the explosion of a Flame, Lightning, or Supernova Gem.\n\nIn Classic Mode, the lowest starting number for a Doom Gem is 9. Only one Doom Gem appears per level starting at level 13.\n\nIn Survivor mode, the Doom Gem is set to a counter of 20, whereas in Eclipse, the Doom Gem is instead set to a counter of 15.\n\nIn Chain Reaction (only Eclipse mode), the Doom Gem is set to a counter of 1 to make the challenge more difficult.\n\nThe notification that appears when a Doom Gem is seen for the first time is the only one in the game that highlights the name of the gem with red text color. Unlike Locking Gems, Locking Doom Gems do not a have a unique mouseover description.\n\nThe sound of a Doom Gem exploding is slightly different from that of a Bomb Gem. The animation slows down a little bit whenever a Doom Gem is destroyed, similar to Coal Gems. Similar to Bomb Gems, the number displayed on the front of a Doom Gem has a colored outline: red-violet. According to early screenshots of Bejeweled Twist, the color of the number displayed on the front of a Doom Gem was originally violet and the outline of the number was bright gray. According to evidence found inside the game files of Bejeweled Twist, it seems that Doom Gems were originally known as Devil Gems. Although Doom Gems do not appear in Bejeweled Blitz and Bejeweled 3, graphics of them can be found inside the game files of those games.\n\nThe sound of the Doom Gem ticking down is the same as the sound heard in Bejeweled 3 when a new Bomb Gem appears on the screen. The lock on a Locking Doom Gem is slightly larger than the lock on a regular Locking Gem, and also has spikes on it. It is possible to clear the Locking Doom Gem in two moves, but it takes timing and speed to execute it.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack to the game is composed by Finnish musician [[Peter Hajba]], known by his demoscene nickname '''Skaven''', and Phillipe Charon.<ref name=\"BejeweledTwist\">{{Cite web | title=Bejeweled Twist Readme | url=http://www.popcap.com/faq/bejeweledtwist/1033/pc/readme.html | postscript=. | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813150254/http://www.popcap.com/faq/bejeweledtwist/1033/pc/readme.html | archivedate=August 13, 2009 }}</ref> The voice in the main menu and during gameplay is performed by [[Ken Tamplin]].<ref name=\"BejeweledTwist\" /> In the Xbox 360 version, it is voiced by [[Lani Minella]].\n\n==Legacy==\nIn [[Bejeweled Blitz|Bejeweled Blitz LIVE]], one of the game modes, Twist, was inspired by this game.

{"title_page": "Hillary Clinton email controversy", "text_new": "{{short description|American political controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's conduct while Secretary of State}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Hillary Clinton series}}\nDuring [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|her tenure as United States Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]] drew controversy by using a private [[email server]] for official public communications rather than using official [[United States Department of State|State Department]] email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed \"Secret\" and 22 deemed \"Top Secret\". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. \n\nSome experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \"innocuous\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach according to the CIA.<ref name=\"secrecy defines\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain |work=Federation of American Scientists |date=June 11, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/ }}</ref>  \n\nThe controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" but recommended that no charges be filed. Clinton's opponent, then presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname \"Crooked Hillary\" to criticize Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas |title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails.

An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed \"Secret\" and 22 deemed \"Top Secret\". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. \n\nSome experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \"innocuous\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach according to the CIA.<ref name=\"secrecy defines\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain |work=Federation of American Scientists |date=June 11, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/ }}</ref>  \n\nThe controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" but recommended that no charges be filed. Clinton's opponent, then presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname \"Crooked Hillary\" to criticize Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas |title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails.
