A sequel to the maxi-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', this book's purpose was to remove the [[Justice Society of America]] from the DC universe, because the writers felt that the team of aging heroes had become irrelevant in the post-''Crisis'' world. However, it was done in such a way that the JSA could be brought back in the future, should any writer wish.\n\n==Main characters==\nThe following heroes take part in the main action of the book:\n{{col-begin|width=60%}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Atom (Al Pratt)]]\n* [[Doctor Fate]] (Kent Nelson)\n* [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] (Charles McNider)\n* [[Flash (Jay Garrick)]]\n* [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]])\n* [[Hawkgirl]] (Shiera Sanders Hall)\n* [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)]]\n* [[Hourman]] (Rex Tyler)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Power Girl]]\n* [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)]]\n* [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandy the Golden Boy]]\n* [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] ([[Jim Corrigan]])\n* [[Star-Spangled Kid]] ([[Sylvester Pemberton]])\n* [[Starman (Ted Knight)]]\n* [[Johnny Thunder]] and his [[Thunderbolt (DC Comics)|Thunderbolt]]\n* [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Wildcat]] (Ted Grant)\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe following heroes appear in the 1945 flashback:\n* [[Batman (Earth-Two)]]\n* [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)]]\n* [[Superman (Earth-Two)]]\n* [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)]]\n\nThe following members of [[Infinity, Inc.]] make two [[cameo appearance]]s:\n* [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave, Jr.]]\n* [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] (Hippolyta Trevor)\n* [[Jade (comics)|Jade]]\n* [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]]\n* [[Nuklon]] ([[Albert Rothstein]])\n* [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]]\n* [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]]\n\nThe principal villain of the story is [[Adolf Hitler]], as he was depicted in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nFifteen members and associates of the Justice Society\u2014Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Flash, Green Lantern, Sandman, Sandy, Starman, Dr. Mid-Nite, Dr. Fate, Atom, Johnny Thunder, Hourman, Wildcat, Power Girl, and Star-Spangled Kid\u2014are gathered for a private memorial service for the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Robin]] and [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] of [[Earth-Two]], who had recently been killed in the Crisis. Feeling redundant in a world filled with younger heroes, the JSA is about to officially disband, when suddenly The Spectre appears to them, apparently fatally wounded despite being a ghost. In an instant of psychic communion, he puts a message into Dr. Fate's head, and then dissipates. Dr. Fate then psychically shares this information with all the others, and elaborates as he casts a spell to transport them all through time and space to Berlin on April 15, 1945.\n\nThe message was that, while The Spectre was lying unconscious in the cosmic void in the aftermath of the Crisis, his unchecked energy had reached out in space and time, making contact with the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] in 1945 while Adolf Hitler was trying to use it to bring about the end of the world. The Spectre's power, added to that of the Spear, enabled it to bring about Hitler's \"Twilight of the Gods,\" destroying the Earth and the universe, and fatally wounding The Spectre in the process. He'd managed to reach the modern-day JSA and warn them of this disaster just before the altered past caught up with the present.\n\nThe heroes arrive at their destination just in time to see Hitler start his spell, opening a whirling hole in the sky. The JSA fly up through the hole and find themselves in the realm of Asgard, home of the Norse/Teutonic Gods, who are about to fight their final battle (i.e., [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]). To prevent the Norse Gods from losing, and thus prevent the destruction of the Earth, Dr. Fate uses his magic to physically merge the other heroes with the Gods, adding to their might and willpower. Many of the heroes/Gods are killed in the battle, but the remaining ones fight on, determined to change its predetermined outcome.\n\nDuring the battle, days pass on Earth; Hitler's spell fails, Germany is defeated by the Allies, and Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] commit suicide.\n\nThe heroes defeat almost all of the enemy, but they still have to beat Surtur, the fire-giant who's determined to burn away all life on the battlefield (and also the Earth). Due to the non-linear nature of time in the Asgardian realm, Dr. Fate is able to bring the slain heroes back to life, and together they fight and kill Surtur. However, because Ragnar\u00f6k is a never-ending battle, the battle starts all over again, and the heroes must re-fight it forever to prevent the end of the world. Dr. Fate sends Power Girl and the Star-Spangled Kid back home against their will, saying the young must sometimes be spared the fate of the old; Fate then prepares to enter the eternal battle alongside his comrades, when The Spectre\u2014apparently fully healed\u2014stops him, saying that Fate's magic is needed to eternally sustain the other heroes. Against his will, Fate is sent back home by The Spectre, who says that he himself has been called home by his Master.\n\nDr. Fate finds himself back at the site of the memorial service along with Power Girl and Star-Spangled Kid. Seven members of Infinity, Inc. are also present, having shown up late for the service, and Fate psychically shows them everything that has happened. They walk away, along with PG and SSK, to grieve for the loss of their families and allies, leaving only Dr. Fate behind. Lying at his feet are chessmen shaped like the eternally-battling heroes.\n\n==Notes==\n* In the story, Hitler's Ragnar\u00f6k spell took place on the day of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s funeral, at which the then-current roster of the JSA (including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Mr. Terrific) served as an honor guard.

Alabama had a chance to win it in regulation but missed a short field goal and the game was sent to OT.

Alabama coach [[Nick Saban]] made a gutsy call at the half to change QBs, going with freshman [[Tua Tagovailoa]]. Alabama chipped away at the Georgia lead in the second half eventually scoring the game tying TD on a 4th and goal from the 6 yard line late in the contest. Alabama had a chance to win it in regulation but missed a short field goal and the game was sent to OT. Georgia kicker Rodrigo Blankenship hit a 51-yard field goal, setting a National Championship game record to give the Bulldogs a 3-point lead in OT. On Alabama's OT possession they scored a TD on second down that won the game and gave Alabama their 5th National Championship under Nick Saban.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Roster==\n{{American football

The magazine is published by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]] on behalf of the Foundation for the Study of Independent Social Ideas. Former co-editors include [[Irving Howe]], [[Mitchell Cohen]], [[Michael Walzer]], and David Marcus.\n\n==History==\nThe magazine was established in 1954 by a group of [[New York Intellectuals]], which included [[Lewis A. Coser]], [[Irving Howe]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Henry Pachter]], and [[Meyer Schapiro]]. From its inception, ''Dissent''{{'}}s politics deviated from the standard ideological positions of the left and right. Like ''[[Politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and the French socialist magazine ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', ''Dissent'' sought to formulate a third position between the liberalism of the West and the communism of the East.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://dissentmagazine.org/files/wordtoreaders1954.pdf|title=A Word to Our Readers|work=Dissent |date=Winter 1954}}</ref> Troubled by the rampant bureaucratization of both capitalist and communist society, ''Dissent'' was home to writers like [[C. Wright Mills]] and [[Paul Goodman]] who identified themselves as radical democrats as well as to editors who like [[Irving Howe]] and [[Michael Harrington]] more closely identified with [[democratic socialism]].

Former co-editors include [[Irving Howe]], [[Mitchell Cohen]], [[Michael Walzer]], and David Marcus.\n\n==History==\nThe magazine was established in 1954 by a group of [[New York Intellectuals]], which included [[Lewis A. Coser]], [[Irving Howe]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Henry Pachter]], and [[Meyer Schapiro]]. From its inception, ''Dissent''{{'}}s politics deviated from the standard ideological positions of the left and right. Like ''[[Politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and the French socialist magazine ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', ''Dissent'' sought to formulate a third position between the liberalism of the West and the communism of the East.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://dissentmagazine.org/files/wordtoreaders1954.pdf|title=A Word to Our Readers|work=Dissent |date=Winter 1954}}</ref> Troubled by the rampant bureaucratization of both capitalist and communist society, ''Dissent'' was home to writers like [[C. Wright Mills]] and [[Paul Goodman]] who identified themselves as radical democrats as well as to editors who like [[Irving Howe]] and [[Michael Harrington]] more closely identified with [[democratic socialism]]. Over its seven decades in publication, it has also become an influential venue for social and cultural criticism, publishing political philosophers including [[Michael Walzer]], [[Cornel West]], and [[Iris Marion Young]], as well as novelists and poets such as [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] and [[Czeslaw Milosz]].<ref>Maurice Isserman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BjK7AAAAIAAJ ''If I Had a Hammer: The Death of the Old Left and the Birth of the New Left''.]</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, ''Dissent''{{'}}s skepticism toward [[Third World]] revolutions and the culture of the [[New Left]] occasionally isolated it from student movements, but its commitment to both pluralist and egalitarian politics\u2014in particular, when it came to social and civil rights issues\u2014separated it from both the mainstream liberalism and the growing [[neoconservative]] movement.
