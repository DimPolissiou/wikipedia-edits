Sporcle began operations as an online [[trivia]] website, launched on January 30, 2007, and expanded into the [[pub quiz]] business in 2013. \n\nThe Sporcle website was started in response to website founder Matt Ramme's desire to learn trivia and his accompanying frustration that there was no existing website suitable for his needs.<ref name=\"globe\">{{cite news|last=Aucoin|first=Don|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2009/06/16/visitors_to_website_sporcle_learn_geography_and_other_subjects____and_have_fun/|title=On top of the world|date=2009-06-16|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> Users can play and make quizzes on this trivia quiz website, which hosts close to one million user-made quizzes that have been played over 3.4 billion times.

Quizzes come in eight game types: Classic, Clickable, Picture Click, Map, Multiple Choice, Picture Box, Slideshow, and Grid, each of which can be played in a variety of ways, including Minefield, Forced Order, or entering the answers in any order. The type and method by which users will complete the quiz is chosen by the quiz creators.\n\n====Categories====\nThe games on Sporcle fall into 15 categories: Entertainment, Gaming, Geography, History, Holiday, Just for Fun, Language, Literature, Miscellaneous, Movies, Music, Religion, Science, Sports, and Television.
