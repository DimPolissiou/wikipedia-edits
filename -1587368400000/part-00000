Subject headings from the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress]] fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort to keep up with these changes and try to bring \"structure and order\" to the task of helping users find information.<ref name=tws2NovY312 />\n\n==Benefits of authority control==\n* ''Better researching''.

The process of authority control is not only of great help to researchers searching for a particular subject to study, but it can help catalogers organize information as well.

(5113074392).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] is described in one authority file as \"Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\" which is an official heading.]]\n\nSometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for only one person or subject.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/><ref name = tws2NovY909 />  This can bring confusion since researchers may miss some information. Authority control is used by catalogers to [[collocation|collocate]] materials that logically belong together but which present themselves differently. Records are used to establish [[uniform title]]s which collocate all versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such versions are issued under different titles. With authority control, one unique preferred name represents all variations and will include different variations, spellings and misspellings, uppercase versus lowercase variants, differing dates, and so forth. For example, in Wikipedia, the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] is described by an article [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] as well as numerous other descriptors, e.g. [[Princess Diana]], but both ''Princess Diana'' and ''Diana, Princess of Wales'' describe the same person; an authority record would choose one title as the preferred one for consistency. In an online library catalog, various entries might look like the following:<ref name=tws2NovY111 /><ref name=\"ALT-for-dead-link-footnote\"/>\n\n::#Diana. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (13)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997 (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (2)\n::#DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES, 1961\u20131997. (1)\n\nThese different terms describe the same person. Accordingly, authority control reduces these entries to one unique entry or official authorized heading, sometimes termed an ''access point'':\n\n::Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n{{clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:35%; border:solid 1px #cccccc; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background-color:#f8f8f8\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n\n|-style=\"background-color:#ccccff; font-size:1.1em;\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Authority File</span>\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Heading / ID</span>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|Virtual International Authority File}}\n|VIAF ID: 107032638\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikipedia\n|Diana, Princess of Wales<ref>Note: this is the article title as of March 12, 2013</ref>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikidata\n|Wikidata identifier: [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9685 Q9685]\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND)\n|GND ID: 118525123\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Library of Congress|U.S. Library of Congress]]\n|Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[WorldCat]] Identities\n|Diana Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[National Library of Spain|Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]\n|Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Getty Union List of Artist Names\n|Diana, Princess of Wales English noble and patron, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|[[National Library of the Netherlands]]}}\n|Diana, prinses van Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n|}\nGenerally there are different authority file headings and identifiers used by different libraries in different countries, possibly inviting confusion, but there are different approaches internationally to try to lessen the confusion. One international effort to prevent such confusion is the [[Virtual International Authority File]] which is a collaborative attempt to provide a single heading for a particular subject. It is a way to standardize information from different authority files around the world such as the [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND) maintained and used cooperatively by many libraries in German-speaking countries and the United States [[Library of Congress]]. The idea is to create a single worldwide virtual authority file. For example, the ID for [[Princess Diana]] in the GND is ''118525123'' (preferred name: ''Diana &lt;Wales, Prinzessin&gt;'') while the United States Library of Congress uses the term ''Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997'';  other authority files have other choices. The Virtual International Authority File choice for all of these variations is ''VIAF ID: 107032638'' \u2014 that is, a common number representing all of these variations.<ref name=\"VIAF\">[[viaf:107032638/|Virtual International Authority File]]. Records for Princess Diana, Retrieved on 12 March 2013</ref>\n\nThe English Wikipedia prefers the term \"Diana, Princess of Wales\", but at the bottom of the article about her, there are links to various international cataloging efforts for reference purposes.\n\n===Same name describes two different subjects===\nSometimes two different authors have been published under the same name.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This can happen if there is a title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918\u20131965 when the person [[Floruit|flourished]], or a brief descriptive epithet. When catalogers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can [[Word-sense disambiguation|disambiguate]] them using authority control.\n\n==Authority records and files==\nA customary way of enforcing authority control in a bibliographic catalog is to set up a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalog. This separate index is often referred to as an \"authority file.\" It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by catalogers in a given library (or\u2014as is increasingly the case\u2014cataloging consortium), which catalogers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings.  As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.<ref name =tws2NovY434 />\n\nWhile authority files provide information about a particular subject, their primary function is not to provide information but to organize it.<ref name=\"tws2NovY434\">{{cite news|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html|title=A bird's eye view of authority control in cataloging|last=Calhoun|first=K.|date=1998|newspaper=Cornell University Library|accessdate=25 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> They contain enough information to establish that a given author or title is unique, but that is all; irrelevant but interesting information is generally excluded.  Although practices vary internationally, authority records in the English-speaking world generally contain the following information:\n\n* ''Headings'' show the preferred title chosen as the official and authorized version. It is important that the heading be unique; if there is a conflict with an identical heading, then one of the two will have to be chosen:\n{{Quote |Since the headings function as access points, making sure that they are distinct and not in conflict with existing entries is important. For example, the English novelist William Collins (1824\u201389), whose works include the Moonstone and The Woman in White is better known as Wilkie Collins. Cataloguers have to decide which name the public would most likely look under, and whether to use a see also reference to link alternative forms of an individual's name.|Mason, M.K.|title=Purpose of authority work and files|source=http://www.moyak.com/papers/libraries-bibliographic-control.html}}\n* ''Cross references'' are other forms of the name or title that might appear in the catalog and include:\n#''see'' references are forms of the name or title that describe the subject but which have been passed over or ''deprecated'' in favor of the authorized heading form\n#''see also'' references point to other forms of the name or title that are also authorized. These ''see also'' references generally point to earlier or later forms of a name or title.\n* ''Statement(s) of justification'' is a brief account made by the cataloger about particular information sources used to determine both authorized and deprecated forms. Sometimes this means citing the title and publication date of the source, the location of the name or title on that source, and the form in which it appears on that source.\n\n[[File:An example of an authority record.png|thumb|right|300px]]\nFor example, the Irish writer [[Brian O'Nolan]], who lived from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many [[pen name]]s such as Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form\u2014\"O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966\"\u2014as the official heading.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://authorities.loc.gov/ | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Authorities files }}; the original record has been abbreviated for clarity.</ref>  The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading ''O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966'' is the form of the name that the [[Library of Congress]] chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with ''Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966'' are the ''see'' references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: \"See O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966.\" There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: \"Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966\" has an extra ''C'' inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized ''C'' shows the correct root word while the preceding ''g'' indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. ''See also'' references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with ''His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939.'' constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds'', whereas the author's other ''noms de plume'' appeared on later publications.\n[[File:Sample Catalog Record.png|thumb|220px|Card catalog records such as this one used to be physical cards contained in long rectangular drawers in a library; today, generally, this information is stored in online databases.<ref name = \"Calhoun\">{{Cite journal | first = Karen | last = Calhoun | publisher = Cornell University Library | url = http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html | title = A Bird's Eye View of Authority Control in Cataloging }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Sample Name Authority Record.png|thumb|220px|Authority control with \"Kesey, Ken\" as the chosen heading.<ref name = \"Calhoun\" />]]\n\n==Access control==\nThe act of choosing a single authorized heading to represent all forms of a name is quite often a difficult and complex task, considering that any given individual may have legally changed their name or used a variety of legal names in the course of their lifetime, as well as a variety of nicknames, pen names, stage names or other alternative names. It may be particularly difficult to choose a single authorized heading for individuals whose various names have controversial political or social connotations, when the choice of authorized heading may be seen as endorsement of the associated political or social ideology.\n\nAn alternative to using authorized headings is the idea of ''access control,'' where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.<ref>Barnhart, L.

Retrieved on 28 January 2020.</ref>\n\n==Cooperative cataloging==\nBefore the advent of digital [[online public access catalog]]s and the Internet, creating and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the authority files of the different libraries. For the early part of library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.\n\nAs libraries became more attuned to the needs of researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as [[OCLC]] and [[RLIN]] in the [[United States]], in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.\n\nIn the United States, the primary organization for maintaining cataloging standards with respect to authority work operates under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]], and is known as the Name Authority Cooperative Program, or NACO Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/|title=Program for

Subject headings from the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress]] fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort to keep up with these changes and try to bring \"structure and order\" to the task of helping users find information.<ref name=tws2NovY312 />\n\n==Benefits of authority control==\n* ''Better researching''. Authority control helps researchers get a handle on a specific subject with less wasted effort.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> A well-designed digital catalog/database enables a researcher to query a few words of an entry to bring up the already established term or phrase, thus improving accuracy and saving time.<ref name=tws2NovY323/>\n* ''Makes searching more predictable''.<ref name=\"tws2NovY909\">{{cite news|url=http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/staff/training/training_docs/authority_control_unicorn.shtml|title=Authority Control in Unicorn WorkFlows August 2001|last=Rutgers University Libraries.|first=|date=2012|work=|access-date=23 January 2020|url-status=live|publisher=|quote=Why Authority Control?}}</ref> It can be used in conjunction with keyword searching using \"and\" or \"not\" or \"or\" or other [[Logical connective|Boolean operators]] on a web browser.<ref name=tws2NovY877/> It increases chances that a given search will return relevant items.<ref name=\"tws2NovY323\">{{cite news|url=https://staff.lib.ncsu.edu/confluence/display/MNC/brief+guidelines+on+authority+control+decision-making|title=Brief guidelines on authority control decision-making|last=NCSU Libraries.|first=|date=2012|work=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113100248/https://staff.lib.ncsu.edu/confluence/display/MNC/brief+guidelines+on+authority+control+decision-making|archive-date=13 January 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Consistency of records''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/authorityworkcre00burg|url-access=registration|title=Authority work: The creation, use, maintenance, and evaluation of authority records and files.|last=Burger|first=R.H.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1985|isbn=9780872874916|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=orhBAAAACAAJ | title=Authority Control: Principles, Applications, and Instructions | publisher=UMI Books on Demand | author=Clack, D.H. | year=1990 | isbn=9780608014432}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/maxwellsguidetoa00maxw_0|url-access=registration|title=Maxwell's guide to authority work|last=Maxwell|first=R.L.|publisher=American Library Association|year=2002|isbn=9780838908228|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* ''Organization and structure of information''.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/>\n* ''Efficiency for catalogers''. The process of authority control is not only of great help to researchers searching for a particular subject to study, but it can help catalogers organize information as well.

(5113074392).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] is described in one authority file as \"Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\" which is an official heading.]]\n\nSometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for only one person or subject.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/><ref name = tws2NovY909 />  This can bring confusion since researchers may miss some information. Authority control is used by catalogers to [[collocation|collocate]] materials that logically belong together but which present themselves differently. Records are used to establish [[uniform title]]s which collocate all versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such versions are issued under different titles. With authority control, one unique preferred name represents all variations and will include different variations, spellings and misspellings, uppercase versus lowercase variants, differing dates, and so forth. For example, in Wikipedia, the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] is described by an article [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] as well as numerous other descriptors, e.g. [[Princess Diana]], but both ''Princess Diana'' and ''Diana, Princess of Wales'' describe the same person; an authority record would choose one title as the preferred one for consistency. In an online library catalog, various entries might look like the following:<ref name=tws2NovY111 /><ref name=\"ALT-for-dead-link-footnote\"/>\n\n::#Diana. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (13)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997 (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (2)\n::#DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES, 1961\u20131997. (1)\n\nThese different terms describe the same person. Accordingly, authority control reduces these entries to one unique entry or official authorized heading, sometimes termed an ''access point'':\n\n::Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n{{clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:35%; border:solid 1px #cccccc; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background-color:#f8f8f8\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n\n|-style=\"background-color:#ccccff; font-size:1.1em;\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Authority File</span>\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Heading / ID</span>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|Virtual International Authority File}}\n|VIAF ID: 107032638\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikipedia\n|Diana, Princess of Wales<ref>Note: this is the article title as of March 12, 2013</ref>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikidata\n|Wikidata identifier: [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9685 Q9685]\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND)\n|GND ID: 118525123\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Library of Congress|U.S. Library of Congress]]\n|Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[WorldCat]] Identities\n|Diana Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[National Library of Spain|Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]\n|Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Getty Union List of Artist Names\n|Diana, Princess of Wales English noble and patron, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|[[National Library of the Netherlands]]}}\n|Diana, prinses van Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n|}\nGenerally there are different authority file headings and identifiers used by different libraries in different countries, possibly inviting confusion, but there are different approaches internationally to try to lessen the confusion. One international effort to prevent such confusion is the [[Virtual International Authority File]] which is a collaborative attempt to provide a single heading for a particular subject. It is a way to standardize information from different authority files around the world such as the [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND) maintained and used cooperatively by many libraries in German-speaking countries and the United States [[Library of Congress]]. The idea is to create a single worldwide virtual authority file. For example, the ID for [[Princess Diana]] in the GND is ''118525123'' (preferred name: ''Diana &lt;Wales, Prinzessin&gt;'') while the United States Library of Congress uses the term ''Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997'';  other authority files have other choices. The Virtual International Authority File choice for all of these variations is ''VIAF ID: 107032638'' \u2014 that is, a common number representing all of these variations.<ref name=\"VIAF\">[[viaf:107032638/|Virtual International Authority File]]. Records for Princess Diana, Retrieved on 12 March 2013</ref>\n\nThe English Wikipedia prefers the term \"Diana, Princess of Wales\", but at the bottom of the article about her, there are links to various international cataloging efforts for reference purposes.\n\n===Same name describes two different subjects===\nSometimes two different authors have been published under the same name.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This can happen if there is a title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918\u20131965 when the person [[Floruit|flourished]], or a brief descriptive epithet. When catalogers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can [[Word-sense disambiguation|disambiguate]] them using authority control.\n\n==Authority records and files==\nA customary way of enforcing authority control in a bibliographic catalog is to set up a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalog. This separate index is often referred to as an \"authority file.\" It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by catalogers in a given library (or\u2014as is increasingly the case\u2014cataloging consortium), which catalogers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings.  As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.<ref name =tws2NovY434 />\n\nWhile authority files provide information about a particular subject, their primary function is not to provide information but to organize it.<ref name=\"tws2NovY434\">{{cite news|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html|title=A bird's eye view of authority control in cataloging|last=Calhoun|first=K.|date=1998|newspaper=Cornell University Library|accessdate=25 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> They contain enough information to establish that a given author or title is unique, but that is all; irrelevant but interesting information is generally excluded.  Although practices vary internationally, authority records in the English-speaking world generally contain the following information:\n\n* ''Headings'' show the preferred title chosen as the official and authorized version. It is important that the heading be unique; if there is a conflict with an identical heading, then one of the two will have to be chosen:\n{{Quote |Since the headings function as access points, making sure that they are distinct and not in conflict with existing entries is important. For example, the English novelist William Collins (1824\u201389), whose works include the Moonstone and The Woman in White is better known as Wilkie Collins. Cataloguers have to decide which name the public would most likely look under, and whether to use a see also reference to link alternative forms of an individual's name.|Mason, M.K.|title=Purpose of authority work and files|source=http://www.moyak.com/papers/libraries-bibliographic-control.html}}\n* ''Cross references'' are other forms of the name or title that might appear in the catalog and include:\n#''see'' references are forms of the name or title that describe the subject but which have been passed over or ''deprecated'' in favor of the authorized heading form\n#''see also'' references point to other forms of the name or title that are also authorized. These ''see also'' references generally point to earlier or later forms of a name or title.\n* ''Statement(s) of justification'' is a brief account made by the cataloger about particular information sources used to determine both authorized and deprecated forms. Sometimes this means citing the title and publication date of the source, the location of the name or title on that source, and the form in which it appears on that source.\n\n[[File:An example of an authority record.png|thumb|right|300px]]\nFor example, the Irish writer [[Brian O'Nolan]], who lived from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many [[pen name]]s such as Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form\u2014\"O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966\"\u2014as the official heading.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://authorities.loc.gov/ | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Authorities files }}; the original record has been abbreviated for clarity.</ref>  The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading ''O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966'' is the form of the name that the [[Library of Congress]] chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with ''Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966'' are the ''see'' references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: \"See O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966.\" There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: \"Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966\" has an extra ''C'' inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized ''C'' shows the correct root word while the preceding ''g'' indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. ''See also'' references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with ''His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939.'' constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds'', whereas the author's other ''noms de plume'' appeared on later publications.\n[[File:Sample Catalog Record.png|thumb|220px|Card catalog records such as this one used to be physical cards contained in long rectangular drawers in a library; today, generally, this information is stored in online databases.<ref name = \"Calhoun\">{{Cite journal | first = Karen | last = Calhoun | publisher = Cornell University Library | url = http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html | title = A Bird's Eye View of Authority Control in Cataloging }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Sample Name Authority Record.png|thumb|220px|Authority control with \"Kesey, Ken\" as the chosen heading.<ref name = \"Calhoun\" />]]\n\n==Access control==\nThe act of choosing a single authorized heading to represent all forms of a name is quite often a difficult and complex task, considering that any given individual may have legally changed their name or used a variety of legal names in the course of their lifetime, as well as a variety of nicknames, pen names, stage names or other alternative names. It may be particularly difficult to choose a single authorized heading for individuals whose various names have controversial political or social connotations, when the choice of authorized heading may be seen as endorsement of the associated political or social ideology.\n\nAn alternative to using authorized headings is the idea of ''access control,'' where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.<ref>Barnhart, L.

Retrieved on 28 January 2020.</ref>\n\n==Cooperative cataloging==\nBefore the advent of digital [[online public access catalog]]s and the Internet, creating and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the authority files of the different libraries. For the early part of library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.\n\nAs libraries became more attuned to the needs of researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as [[OCLC]] and [[RLIN]] in the [[United States]], in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.\n\nIn the United States, the primary organization for maintaining cataloging standards with respect to authority work operates under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]], and is known as the Name Authority Cooperative Program, or NACO Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/|title=Program for

Chevron's \"People Do\" advertisements were aimed at a \"hostile audience\" of \"societally conscious\" people. Two years after the launch of the campaign, surveys found people in California trusted Chevron more than other oil companies to protect the environment. In the late 1980s The [[American Chemistry Council]] started a program called [[Responsible Care]], which shone light on the environmental performances and precautions of the group's members. The loose guidelines of responsible care caused industries to adopt self-regulation over government regulation.<ref name=tglo/><ref name=gfs/>\n\nIn 1991, a study published in the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing ([[American Marketing Association]]) found that 58% of environmental ads had at least one deceptive claim. Another study found that 77% of people said the environmental reputation of company affected whether they would buy their products. One fourth of all household products marketed around Earth Day advertised themselves as being green and environmentally friendly. In 1998 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] created the \"Green Guidelines,\" which defined terms used in environmental marketing. The following year the FTC found that the Nuclear Energy Institute claims of being environmentally clean were not true. The FTC did nothing about the ads because they were out of their jurisdiction. This caused the FTC to realize they needed new clear enforceable standards. In 1999, according to environmental activist organizations, the word \"greenwashing\" was added to the ''Oxford English Dictionary''.<ref name=tglo/><ref name=gfs/>\n\nIn 2002, during the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg, the Greenwashing Academy hosted the Greenwash Academy Awards.

In 2005, Ramus and Monteil conducted secondary data analysis of two databases to uncover corporate commitment to implementation of environmental policies as opposed to greenwashing.

In general, if the environmental attribute or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified \"[[recyclable]]\" claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.<ref name=gft/>\n*Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the environmental attribute or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is in fact negligible.<ref name=gft/>\n*Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a comparative statement should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.<ref name=gft/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe FTC has said in 2010 that it will update its guidelines for environmental marketing claims in an attempt to reduce greenwashing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencleancertified.com/green-cleaning-health/green-watch/FTC-Reviews-Guidelines-for-Green-Claims/ |title=FTC Reviews Guidelines for Green Claims |website=Greencleancertified.com |date=2016-06-15 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref> The revision to the FTC's Green Guides covers a wide range of public input, including hundreds of consumer and industry comments on previously proposed revisions. The updates and revision to the existing Guides include a new section of carbon offsets, \"green\" certifications and seals renewable energy and renewable materials claims.

TerraChoice Environmental Marketing, an advertising consultancy company, issued a report denoting a 79% increase in the usage of corporate greenwashing between 2007 and 2009. Additionally, it has begun to manifest itself in new varied ways. Within the non-residential building products market in the United States, some companies are beginning to claim that their environmentally minded policy changes will allow them to earn points through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating program. This point system has been held up as an example of the \"gateway effect\" that the drive to market products as environmentally friendly is having on company policies. Some have claimed that the greenwashing trend may be enough to eventually effect a genuine reduction in environmentally damaging practices.\n\nAccording to the Home and Family Edition, 95% consumer products claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of the \"Sins of Greenwashing\". The Seven Sins of Greenwashing are as follows:\n# Sin of the Hidden Trade-off, committed by suggesting a product is \"green\" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other important environmental issues.\n# Sin of No Proof, committed by an environmental claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible supporting information or by a reliable third-party certification. \n# Sin of [[Vagueness]], committed by every claim that is so poorly defined or broad that its real meaning is likely to be misunderstood by the consumer.\n# Sin of Worshiping False Labels is committed when a claim, communicated either through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party [[testimonial|endorsement]] where no such endorsement exists. \n# Sin of [[Irrelevance]], committed by making an environmental claim that may be truthful but which is unimportant or unhelpful for consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.\n# Sin of Lesser of Two Evils, committed by claims that may be true within the product category, but that risk distracting consumers from the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole.\n# Sin of [[Fibbing]], the least frequent Sin, is committed by making environmental claims that are simply false.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/ |title=Home and Family Edition |publisher=The Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2016-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717143618/http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/ |archive-date=2014-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Ed Gillespie identified \"ten signs of greenwashing\", which are similar to the ''Seven Sins'' listed above, but with three additional indicators.\n# Suggestive pictures - Images that imply a baseless green impact, such as flowers issuing from the exhaust pipe of a vehicle.\n# Just not credible - A claim that touts the [[environmentally friendly]] attributes of a dangerous product, such as cigarettes.\n# Gobbledygook - The use of [[jargon]] or information that the average person can not readily understand or be able to verify.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gillespie |first=Ed |title=Stemming the tide of 'greenwash' |journal=Consumer Policy Review |date=May 2008 |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=79 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32818374/stemming-tide-greenwash |via=ebscohost |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCompanies may pursue [[environmental certification]] to avoid greenwashing through independent verification of their green claims.

Chevron's \"People Do\" advertisements were aimed at a \"hostile audience\" of \"societally conscious\" people. Two years after the launch of the campaign, surveys found people in California trusted Chevron more than other oil companies to protect the environment. In the late 1980s The [[American Chemistry Council]] started a program called [[Responsible Care]], which shone light on the environmental performances and precautions of the group's members. The loose guidelines of responsible care caused industries to adopt self-regulation over government regulation.<ref name=tglo/><ref name=gfs/>\n\nIn 1991, a study published in the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing ([[American Marketing Association]]) found that 58% of environmental ads had at least one deceptive claim. Another study found that 77% of people said the environmental reputation of company affected whether they would buy their products. One fourth of all household products marketed around Earth Day advertised themselves as being green and environmentally friendly. In 1998 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] created the \"Green Guidelines,\" which defined terms used in environmental marketing. The following year the FTC found that the Nuclear Energy Institute claims of being environmentally clean were not true. The FTC did nothing about the ads because they were out of their jurisdiction. This caused the FTC to realize they needed new clear enforceable standards. In 1999, according to environmental activist organizations, the word \"greenwashing\" was added to the ''Oxford English Dictionary''.<ref name=tglo/><ref name=gfs/>\n\nIn 2002, during the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg, the Greenwashing Academy hosted the Greenwash Academy Awards.

In 2005, Ramus and Monteil conducted secondary data analysis of two databases to uncover corporate commitment to implementation of environmental policies as opposed to greenwashing.

Listed below are the green guidelines set by the FTC.\n<blockquote>\n*Qualifications and disclosures: The Commission traditionally has held that in order to be effective, any qualifications or disclosures such as those described in these guides should be sufficiently clear, prominent and understandable to prevent deception. Clarity of language, relative type size and proximity to the claim being qualified, and an absence of contrary claims that could undercut effectiveness, will maximize the likelihood that the qualifications and disclosures are appropriately clear and prominent.<ref name=gft>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117145015/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm |archivedate=November 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n*Distinction between benefits of product, package and service: An environmental marketing claim should be presented in a way that makes clear whether the environmental attribute or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product's [[packaging]], a service or to a portion or component of the product, package or service. In general, if the environmental attribute or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified \"[[recyclable]]\" claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.<ref name=gft/>\n*Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the environmental attribute or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is in fact negligible.<ref name=gft/>\n*Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a comparative statement should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.<ref name=gft/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe FTC has said in 2010 that it will update its guidelines for environmental marketing claims in an attempt to reduce greenwashing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencleancertified.com/green-cleaning-health/green-watch/FTC-Reviews-Guidelines-for-Green-Claims/ |title=FTC Reviews Guidelines for Green Claims |website=Greencleancertified.com |date=2016-06-15 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref> The revision to the FTC's Green Guides covers a wide range of public input, including hundreds of consumer and industry comments on previously proposed revisions. The updates and revision to the existing Guides include a new section of carbon offsets, \"green\" certifications and seals renewable energy and renewable materials claims. According to FTC Chairman [[Jon Leibowitz]], \"The introduction of environmentally friendly products into the marketplace is a win for consumers who want to purchase greener products and producers who wants to sell them.\" Leibowitz also says the win-win can only claim if marketers' claims are straightforward and proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/greenguides.shtm |title=FTC Issues Revised \"Green Guides\"  |website=US Federal Trade Commission |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the FTC began enforcing the revisions put forth in the Green Guides. The FTC cracked down on six different companies, in which five of the cases were concerned with the false or misleading advertising surrounding the [[biodegradability]] of plastics.

TerraChoice Environmental Marketing, an advertising consultancy company, issued a report denoting a 79% increase in the usage of corporate greenwashing between 2007 and 2009. Additionally, it has begun to manifest itself in new varied ways. Within the non-residential building products market in the United States, some companies are beginning to claim that their environmentally minded policy changes will allow them to earn points through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating program. This point system has been held up as an example of the \"gateway effect\" that the drive to market products as environmentally friendly is having on company policies. Some have claimed that the greenwashing trend may be enough to eventually effect a genuine reduction in environmentally damaging practices.\n\nAccording to the Home and Family Edition, 95% consumer products claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of the \"Sins of Greenwashing\". The Seven Sins of Greenwashing are as follows:\n# Sin of the Hidden Trade-off, committed by suggesting a product is \"green\" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other important environmental issues.\n# Sin of No Proof, committed by an environmental claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible supporting information or by a reliable third-party certification. \n# Sin of [[Vagueness]], committed by every claim that is so poorly defined or broad that its real meaning is likely to be misunderstood by the consumer.\n# Sin of Worshiping False Labels is committed when a claim, communicated either through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party [[testimonial|endorsement]] where no such endorsement exists. \n# Sin of [[Irrelevance]], committed by making an environmental claim that may be truthful but which is unimportant or unhelpful for consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.\n# Sin of Lesser of Two Evils, committed by claims that may be true within the product category, but that risk distracting consumers from the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole.\n# Sin of [[Fibbing]], the least frequent Sin, is committed by making environmental claims that are simply false.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/ |title=Home and Family Edition |publisher=The Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2016-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717143618/http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/ |archive-date=2014-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Ed Gillespie identified \"ten signs of greenwashing\", which are similar to the ''Seven Sins'' listed above, but with three additional indicators.\n# Suggestive pictures - Images that imply a baseless green impact, such as flowers issuing from the exhaust pipe of a vehicle.\n# Just not credible - A claim that touts the [[environmentally friendly]] attributes of a dangerous product, such as cigarettes.\n# Gobbledygook - The use of [[jargon]] or information that the average person can not readily understand or be able to verify.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gillespie |first=Ed |title=Stemming the tide of 'greenwash' |journal=Consumer Policy Review |date=May 2008 |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=79 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32818374/stemming-tide-greenwash |via=ebscohost |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCompanies may pursue [[environmental certification]] to avoid greenwashing through independent verification of their green claims.

Shani has also been raising her spirited son Jomo, a very energetic young elephant who just wants to play with the other animals, such as lechwes and [[baboons]].\n\nWhen the land is about to dry up, Gaia leads the elephants to an almost dry waterhole to enjoy the mud before leaving the desert. They are soon joined by other elephants who visit, play, and drink from the water. When the water dries up, Gaia notices a baby elephant suffocating and stuck in the mud, so she goes to its rescue, and the baby is reunited with its mother. \n\nThe Herd leaves the desert to join the other elephants on the long journey, they take a lunch break to have a family reunion with other herds of elephants, with some not seeing Gaia for over a year. Jomo starts making new friends with the other baby elephants, and for ages, Shani reunites with many of her long lost cousins. Gaia's herd and other herds of elephants have no luck trying to find food, but a male elephant (who is visiting his family) uses his trunk to drop a bunch of seedpods from trees. Everyone munches happily.\n\nGaia's herd comes across ancient paths that their ancestors created when they migrated. When they've reached a dry waterhole, they noticed an elephant skeleton. Shani shows a confused Jomo a life lesson. The herd moves on and finds another waterhole (this time with water). As the elephants drink, Jomo plays with a group of [[warthogs]]. The water is ruined by its previous visitors, so the elephants munch on Mopani trees but are chased off by caterpillars eating the entire trees.\n\nThe Herd continues their journey to a small little island. There is no water for them to drink, but Gaia leads her herd to Baobab trees which they could drink water from its sap. Shani teaches the young elephants how to get sap by ripping the thick bark. The Herd rests on the island for the night.\n\nContinuing their journey, the Herd trudges through sand storms. Shani and Gaia sense the ground trembling, which meant a river close by, but they are despaired when they reach the river. It is far below the cliffs where the elephants are, but thanks to the help of a flock of Quelea birds, the herd makes their way to [[Victoria Falls]], the place that Gaia has been searching for. The Herd happily drinks, but are soon confronted by [[crocodiles]]. Luckily no one was hurt when they crossed the river. They reach the islands, and The Herd enjoys their times in Victoria Falls and even munch on [[Palm nuts]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the highlands of [[Angola]], rain starts to pour, which means the water is going off to the [[Okavango Delta]], Shani and Jomo's home.\n\nSoon after, Gaia starts to get tired and weak and finds the food hard to eat. She and The Herd start making their way back to Okavango. Shani helps Gaia gather the herd, with Jomo by their side. Gaia realizes that the Angolan falls are early, and she and Shani immediately gather the herd to use the shortest route, but they soon find themselves confronted by a pride of [[Lions]]. As the elephants settle in for the night, the lions attack Jomo, but he is saved by Shani. But by morning, Gaia dies, with the herd sharing a heartbreaking goodbye to their great matriarch, while the lions share their feast. Shani finds her leadership to the other elephants difficult. A week later, an elephant gives birth to a newborn baby calf. Jomo is unimpressed, but soon lets go of being the baby of the family and warms up to his new playmate.\n\nShani soon uses Gaia's memories, and begins to lead the herd back to the Delta. They are soon confronted by a rival herd of elephants, who are going after the newborn calf. Shani stands her ground at the rival matriarch, and the rival herd retreats. They make their way home to Okavango, where the land is bursting back to life. The Herd soon accepts Shani as the new matriarch, while Jomo teaches the newborn calf how to play with the other animals.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|12036052}}\n* {{Disney+ movie}}\n\n{{Disney+ Films}}\n{{Disneynature}}\n\n[[Category:2020 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Disneynature films]]\n[[Category:Disney+ original films]]\n[[Category:Films about elephants]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Linfield]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n{{nature-documentary-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Film about elephants}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Elephant\n| image          = Elephant - official release poster.jpg\n| caption        = Official release poster\n| director       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Mark Linfield]]\n* Vanessa Berlowitz\n}}\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Mark Linfield\n* Vanessa Berlowitz\n* [[Roy Conli]]\n}}\n| writer         = \n| narrator       = [[Meghan Markle]]\n| music          = [[Ramin Djawadi]]\n| cinematography = {{Plainlist|\n* Martyn Colbeck\n* Mike Holding\n* Tom Walker\n}}\n| editing        = Nigel Buck\n| studio         = [[Disneynature]]\n| distributor    = [[Disney+]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2020|04|03}}\n| runtime        = 89 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''Elephant''''' is an American [[Nature documentary|nature documentary]] film about [[Elephant|elephants]] directed by [[Mark Linfield]] and Vanessa Berlowitz and narrated by [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex]].<ref>https://dtcimedia.disney.com/news/earth-month-disneynature-2020</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/meghan-markle-disney-plus-elephants-1203545835/|title=Meghan Markle Narrating Disney Plus Nature Documentary \u2018Elephants\u2019|website=Variety|last=Vary|first=Adam B.|date=March 26, 2020|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> It is the fifteenth nature documentary to be released under the [[Disneynature]] label.

The Herd rests on the island for the night.\n\nContinuing their journey, the Herd trudges through sand storms. Shani and Gaia sense the ground trembling, which meant a river close by, but they are despaired when they reach the river. It is far below the cliffs where the elephants are, but thanks to the help of a flock of Quelea birds, the herd makes their way to [[Victoria Falls]], the place that Gaia has been searching for. The Herd happily drinks, but are soon confronted by [[crocodiles]]. Luckily no one was hurt when they crossed the river. They reach the islands, and The Herd enjoys their times in Victoria Falls and even munch on [[Palm nuts]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the highlands of [[Angola]], rain starts to pour, which means the water is going off to the [[Okavango Delta]], Shani and Jomo's home.\n\nSoon after, Gaia starts to get tired and weak and finds the food hard to eat. She and The Herd start making their way back to Okavango. Shani helps Gaia gather the herd, with Jomo by their side. Gaia realizes that the Angolan falls are early, and she and Shani immediately gather the herd to use the shortest route, but they soon find themselves confronted by a pride of [[Lions]]. As the elephants settle in for the night, the lions attack Jomo, but he is saved by Shani. But by morning, Gaia dies, with the herd sharing a heartbreaking goodbye to their great matriarch, while the lions share their feast. Shani finds her leadership to the other elephants difficult. A week later, an elephant gives birth to a newborn baby calf. Jomo is unimpressed, but soon lets go of being the baby of the family and warms up to his new playmate.\n\nShani soon uses Gaia's memories, and begins to lead the herd back to the Delta. They are soon confronted by a rival herd of elephants, who are going after the newborn calf. Shani stands her ground at the rival matriarch, and the rival herd retreats. They make their way home to Okavango, where the land is bursting back to life. The Herd soon accepts Shani as the new matriarch, while Jomo teaches the newborn calf how to play with the other animals.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|12036052}}\n* {{Disney+ movie}}\n\n{{Disney+ Films}}\n{{Disneynature}}\n\n[[Category:2020 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Disneynature films]]\n[[Category:Disney+ original films]]\n[[Category:Films about elephants]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Linfield]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n{{nature-documentary-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "216.154.40.172", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_(2020_film)"}

In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century.

The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched.

He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor.

Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council.

In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started. They found home in [[Church of the Jacobins|''Les Jacobins'']]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Within the Kingdom of France===\n\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] and declared a \"[[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|royal city]]\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1323 the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the next hundred years. The [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\n\nThe 14th century brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population by [[crusades|Crusaders]] in 1320,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/.\" | title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. \"Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\" The Atlantic.

For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
