quickly to wireless devices if a ballistic missile is heading toward Hawaii. If the missile is fired from North Korea, the missile would take approximately 20 minutes to reach Hawaii. [[United States Pacific Command|PACOM]] would take less than 5 minutes to make a determination that the missile could impact Hawaii and would then notify the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA). HI-EMA would issue the Civil Defense Warning (CDW) that an inbound missile could impact Hawaii and that people should Shelter-in-Place: ''Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned''. People in Hawaii would have 12 to 15 minutes before impact. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not required to be notified for approval to cancel an alert. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the President. FEMA can send alerts to targeted audiences but has not implemented this as of January 2018. Other states can take as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute a missile alert.

quickly to wireless devices if a ballistic missile is heading toward Hawaii. If the missile is fired from North Korea, the missile would take approximately 20 minutes to reach Hawaii. [[United States Pacific Command|PACOM]] would take less than 5 minutes to make a determination that the missile could impact Hawaii and would then notify the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA). HI-EMA would issue the Civil Defense Warning (CDW) that an inbound missile could impact Hawaii and that people should Shelter-in-Place: ''Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned''. People in Hawaii would have 12 to 15 minutes before impact. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not required to be notified for approval to cancel an alert. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the President. FEMA can send alerts to targeted audiences but has not implemented this as of January 2018. Other states can take as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute a missile alert.

At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century.\n\nThe Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019). The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company. Bloomsbury Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4088-6440-1}}.</ref> After the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, the British government assumed direct administration of India. The Bengal Presidency was re-organized. In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].\n\nBengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name=\"Parthasarathi\">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600\u20131850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself. Western areas, including the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] and [[Punjab Province (British India)|The Punjab]], were further reorganized. Northeastern areas became [[Colonial Assam]]. The [[Partition of British India]] in 1947 resulted in [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Bengal's division]] on religious grounds.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:Jahangir of India.jpg|thumb|Jahangir first permitted the East India Company (HEIC) to trade in Bengal]]\nIn 1599, a [[Royal Charter]] was granted by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] to allow the creation of a trading company in [[London]] for the purposes of trade with the East Indies. The governance of the company was placed in the hands of a governor and a 24-member Court of Directors. The corporation became known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). It rose to account for half of the world's trade. The company was given a monopoly for British trade in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  \n \nIn 1608, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading post on the west coast of India. It was followed in 1611 by a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] in South India, and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies to trade in the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]] in the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452\u2013472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, as the Nawab of Bengal in [[Murshidabad]] became financially independent with the help of bankers such as the [[Jagat Seth]]. The Nawabs began entering into treaties with numerous European companies, including the [[French East India Company]], the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the [[Danish East India Company]]. The Mughal court in [[Delhi]] was weakened by [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion from Persia (1739) and [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]]'s invasion from Afghanistan (1761). The East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (against the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757) and the [[Battle of Buxar]] (against the Nawabs of Bengal and [[Nawab of Oudh|Oudh]] in 1764) led to the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793. The Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across India and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=473\u2013487}}</ref> By the mid-19th century, the East India Company had become the paramount political and military power in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

II|1908|pp=488\u2013514}}</ref> The Company also issued coins in the name of the nominal Mughal Emperor (who was exiled in 1857).\n\n===Administrative changes and the Permanent Settlement===\n{{see also|Cornwallis in India}}\n[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, which marked the defeat of the last independent Nawab of Bengal [[Siraj-ud-Daulah]]]]\n[[File:The trail of Warren Hastings, 1788.jpg|thumb|The [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings]]]] \nUnder [[Warren Hastings]], the consolidation of British imperial rule over Bengal was solidified, with the  conversion of a trade area into an occupied territory under a military-civil government, while the formation of a regularised system of legislation was brought in under [[John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth|John Shore]]. Acting through [[Lord Cornwallis]], then Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or ''zamindars'', on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the [[Permanent Settlement]] of the Land Revenue. It was designed to \"introduce\" ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.\n\nThe ''Cornwallis Code'', while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ''ryots'' (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of [[opium]] and [[indigo]], the former by the state, and the latter by British planters. Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.\n\nSo unsuccessful was the Permanent Settlement that it was not introduced in the North-Western Provinces (taken from the Marathas during the campaigns of [[Lord Lake]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]) after 1831, in Punjab after its conquest in 1849, or in [[Oudh]] which was annexed in 1856. These regions were nominally part of the Bengal Presidency, but remained administratively distinct. The area of the Presidency under direct administration was sometimes referred to as Lower Bengal to distinguish it from the Presidency as a whole. Officially Punjab, Agra and Allahabad had Lieutenant-Governors subject to the authority of the Governor of Bengal in Calcutta, but in practice they were more or less independent. The only all-Presidency institutions which remained were the Bengal Army and the Civil Service. The Bengal Army was finally amalgamated into the new [[British-Indian Army]] in 1904\u20135, after a lengthy struggle over its reform between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the Commander-in-Chief, and [[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy.\n\n===Straits Settlements===\nIn 1830, the British Straits Settlements on the coast of the [[Malacca Straits]] was made a residency of the Presidency of Bengal in Calcutta. The area included the erstwhile [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Province Wellesley]], as well as the ports of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. Previously, the Straits Settlements (formed by the HEIC in 1826) was administered as a separate presidency with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as the capital. However, the presidency was found to be too costly to administer. Hence, the HEIC decided to reduce the status of the Straits Settlements from a presidency to a residency of the Presidency of Bengal, which was under the governor-general of India based in Calcutta.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> As a residency, all administrative decisions and legislations concerning the Straits Settlements were made in Calcutta, and the governor of the Straits Settlements became a mere resident without executive and legislative powers. Overall, this arrangement proved to be ineffective. Without proper representation in Calcutta and due to the distance between the Straits Settlements and Calcutta, the Indian government found it difficult to advance their interests in the Straits such as by cultivating better ties with the Malay states.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Straits Settlements remained in the Presidency of Bengal for more than three decades. During this period, the Straits Settlements underwent a number of administrative changes. In 1832, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements. In 1851, direct control over the Straits Settlements was transferred to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. Under the administration of the East India Company, the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,<ref>Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857\u20138: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press.

The [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] divisions, the [[Malda District]] and the States of [[Tripura (princely state)|Hill Tripura]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Comilla]] were transferred from Bengal to a new province, [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]; the five Hindi-speaking states of [[Chota Nagpur States|Chota Nagpur]], namely [[Changbhakar State|Changbhakar]], [[Koriya State|Korea]], [[Surguja State|Surguja]], [[Udaipur State, Chhattisgarh|Udaipur]] and [[Jashpur State]], were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces; and [[Sambalpur State]] and the five Oriya states of [[Bamra State|Bamra]], [[Rairakhol State|Rairakhol]], [[Sonepur State|Sonepur]], [[Patna State|Patna]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]] were transferred from the [[Central Provinces]] to Bengal.\n\nThe province of West Bengal then consisted of the thirty-three districts of [[Burdwan District|Burdwan]], [[Birbhum District|Birbhum]], [[Bankura]], [[Midnapur]], [[Hooghly District|Hughli]], [[Howrah]], [[Twenty-four Parganas]], [[Calcutta]], [[Nadia District|Nadia]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Jessore]], [[Khulna]], [[Patna]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Shahabad District|Shahabad]], [[Saran district|Saran]], [[Champaran District|Champaran]], [[Muzaffarpur District|Muzaffarpur]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Monghyr]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Purnea]], [[Santhal Parganas]], [[Cuttack]], [[Balasore]], [[Angul]] and [[Kandhmal]], [[Puri]], [[Sambalpur]], [[Singhbhum]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Ranchi]], [[Palamau]], and [[Manbhum]]. The [[princely states]] of [[Sikkim]] and the [[tributary state]]s of [[Odisha]] and [[Chhota Nagpur States|Chhota Nagpur]] were not part of Bengal, but British relations with them were managed by its government.\n\nThe [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] expanded the legislative councils of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam provinces to include up to 50 nominated and elected members, in addition to three ''ex officio'' members from the executive council.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 431.</ref>\n\nBengal's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 could be officials, and two nominated experts. Of the 26 elected members, one was elected by the [[Corporation of Calcutta]], six by municipalities, six by district boards, one by the [[University of Calcutta]], five by landholders, four by Muslims, two by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, and one by the Calcutta Trades Association. Eastern Bengal and Assam's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 be officials and one representing Indian commerce, and two nominated experts. Of the 18 elected members, three were elected by municipalities, five by district and local boards, two by landowners, four by Muslims, two by the tea interest, one by the jute interest, and one by the Commissioners of the [[Port of Chittagong]].<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 432\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe partition of Bengal proved highly controversial, as it resulted in a largely Hindu West Bengal and a largely Muslim East. Serious popular agitation followed the step, partly on the grounds that this was part of a cynical policy of divide and rule, and partly that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically dominant under the one, while the bulk would be in the new division. In 1906\u20131909 the unrest developed to a considerable extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and Home governments, and this led to the decision being reversed in 1911.\n\n===Reorganisation of Bengal, 1912===\n[[File:King George V 1911 color-crop.jpg|thumb|In 1911, George V announced the annulment of the first partition of Bengal and the transfer of India's capital from Calcutta to New Delhi]]\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to Delhi, the reunification of the five predominantly Bengali-speaking divisions into a Presidency (or province) of Bengal under a Governor, the creation of a new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] under a lieutenant-governor, and that [[Assam Province]] would be reconstituted under a chief commissioner. On 21 March 1912 [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael|Thomas Gibson-Carmichael]] was appointed Governor of Bengal; prior to that date the Governor-General of India had also served as the governor of Bengal Presidency.

The partition was opposed by the last Governor of Bengal Sir [[Frederick Burrows]].<ref>''The Transfer of Power in India'' By [[V.P.

It was the only province that would be allowed to remain independent should it  choose to do so. On May 23, the British Cabinet meeting also hoped that Bengal would remain united. British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] on 2 June 1947 that there was a\"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Shoaib Daniyal |url=https://scroll.in/article/907754/why-did-british-prime-minister-attlee-think-bengal-was-going-to-be-an-independent-country-in-1947 |title=Why did British prime minister Attlee think Bengal was going to be an independent country in 1947? |publisher=Scroll.in |date=2019-01-06 |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] gave a mandate for [[Sylhet Division]] to be re-united into Bengal. However, Hindu nationalist leaders in West Bengal and conservative East Bengali Muslim leaders were against the prospect.\n\nOn 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to vote on partition plans. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

The governor of Bengal was concurrently the governor-general of India for many years. The East India Company maintained control with its private armies and administrative machinery. Nevertheless, the East India Company was a quasi-official entity, having received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1600. The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] caused the British government to assume direct control of India's administration under the [[Government of India Act, 1858]]. The head of state became the [[British monarch]], who was also given the title of [[Emperor of India]]/[[Empress of India]]. The monarch was represented through a viceroy. The [[Viceroy of India]] was based in the Bengal Presidency until 1911. The [[Secretary of State for India]] was also an important official. The Bengal Civil Service managed the provincial government. Modern scholars decry the colonial system as bureaucratic authoritarianism.<ref name=\"JalalJalal1995\">{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor History Ayesha Jalal|author2=Ayesha Jalal|title=Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia: A Comparative and Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHPok4epvlIC|date=6 April 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47862-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\n===Executive councils===\nEstablished by [[Charter Act of 1833]], the [[Council of India|Governor-General in Council]] was subordinate to the Court of Directors of the East India Company and the British Crown. The Governor-General in Council in Fort William enacted legislation, such as the prohibition of Persian as an official language under Act no. XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[File:Calcutta High Court 1860.jpg|thumb|Calcutta High Court, 1860s]]\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] was set up in 1862. The building was designed on the model of [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] in Belgium. The [[Dhaka High Court|Dacca High Court]] building was built during the early 20th century, with elements of a Roman [[Pantheon (Rome)|pantheon]]. District courts were established in all district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. At the district level, tax collectors and revenue officers acted with the power of [[magistrates]]. In 1814, the East India Company pressed the Bengal Government to consider the [[Madras Presidency]]'s model of uniting of judicial and executive powers at the district level. Ultimately Lord Hastings empowered the Governor General-in-Council by Regulation IV of 1821 to authorize the Collectors and Revenue Officers to exercise powers of magistrates. In 1829, magisterial power was given to all Collectors and Revenue Officers. The controversy regarding the lack of [[separation of powers]] continued until 1921. During the period from 1853 to 1921, as many as four reports were prepared on the issue of separation of the judiciary from the executive. The first was in 1893, the second in 1900, the third in 1908 and the fourth in 1913. The Islington Commission was formed by the Secretary of State for India in 1912 to enquire into the problems of judicial administration in India. In its report submitted on August 14, 1915; the Commission opined that legislation would be necessary to effect separation of executive and judicial functions of the officers. Despite these reports, the structure as laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure continued until 1921. On April 5, 1921 the Bengal Legislative Council adopted the following resolution: \"This Council recommends to the Government that early steps be taken for the separation of the judiciary from the executive functions in the administration of this Presidency.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Separation_of_the_Judiciary |title=Separation of the Judiciary - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Council (1862-1947)===\n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Council}}\n{{See also|Legislative Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam}}\n[[File:The Town Hall, Calcutta in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|The Legislative Council met in Calcutta Town Hall]]\nThe British government began to appoint legislative councils under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. The Bengal Legislative Council was established in 1862. It was one of the largest and most important legislative councils in British India. Over the years, the council's powers were gradually expanded from an advisory role to debating government policies and enacting legislation. Under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], the council became the [[upper chamber]] of the Bengali legislature.\n\n===Dyarchy (1920\u201337)===\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, enacted in 1921, expanded the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members to include more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were [[Surendranath Banerjee]] (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921\u20131924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927\u20131928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] (Education 1924). [[Bhupendra Nath Bose]] and [[Abdur Rahim (judge)|Sir Abdur Rahim]] were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Working Of Dyarchy In India 1919 1928|publisher=D.B.Taraporevala Sons And Company.|url=https://archive.org/details/workingofdyarchy029425mbp}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Assembly (1935-1947)===      \n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Assembly}}\n[[File:Bengal PMs.png|thumb|Statesmen who served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]]]\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 established the Bengal Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber of the Bengali legislature. It was a 250-seat assembly where most members were elected by either the General Electorate or the Muslim Electorate (under the [[Communal Award]]). Other members were nominated. The separate electorate dividing Muslims from the general electorate was deeply controversial. The [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] was a member of the assembly.\n\nIn the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|1937 election]], the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] emerged as the single largest party but short of an absolute majority. The second-largest party was the [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]] (BPML), followed in third place by the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. The BPML, Krishak Praja Party and independent legislators formed a coalition government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jalal |first=Ayesha |authorlink=Ayesha Jalal |date=1994 |title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&pg=PA26 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=26\u201327 |isbn=978-0-521-45850-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sanaullah|first1=Muhammad|title=A.K.

Fazlul Huq]], a founder of the BPML who later broke away to form the Krishak Praja Party, was elected as parliamentary leader and prime minister. Huq pursued a policy of [[Hindu-Muslim unity]]. His cabinet included leading Hindu and Muslim figures, including [[Nalini Ranjan Sarkar]] (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja [[Srish Chandra Nandy]] (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab [[Khwaja Habibullah]] (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), [[Musharraf Hussain (nawab)|Nawab Musharraf Hussain]] (judicial and legislative affairs), and [[Syed Nausher Ali]] (public health and local self-government).<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Huq,_AK_Fazlul</ref> Huq promoted financial and [[land reform]]s with the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938), The Money Lenders' Act (1938), and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938). He introduced the Primary Education Bill to make primary education free and compulsory. He established schools such as the [[Lady Brabourne College]]. In 1941, Prime Minister Huq joined the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy's]] Defence Council in support of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war efforts. In a letter to Governor [[John Herbert (Conservative politician)|John Herbert]], Huq called for the resurrection of a Bengal Army. He wrote \"I want you to consent to the formation of a Bengali Army of a hundred thousand young Bengalis consisting of Hindu and Muslim youths on a fifty-fifty basis. There is an insistent demand for such a step being taken at once, and the people of Bengal will not be satisfied with any excuses. It is a national demand which must be immediately conceded\".<ref name=\"thedailystar1\">{{cite web|author=Syed Ashraf Ali |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-60600 |title=Sher-e-Bangla: A natural leader |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> Huq supported the adoption of the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1940. He envisaged Bengal as one of the \"independent states\" outlined by the resolution.\n\nThe first Huq cabinet dissolved after the BPML withdrew from his government. Huq then formed a second coalition with the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] led by [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]]. This cabinet was known as the Shyama-Huq Coalition.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\"/> The cabinet included Nawab Bahabur Khwaja Habibullah, Khan Bahadur Abdul Karim, Khan Bahadur Hashem Ali Khan, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Santosh Kumar Bose and Upendranath Barman. Huq's government fell in 1943 and a BPML government under [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]] as [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Prime Minister]] was formed. Nazimuddin's tenure coincided with the Bengal famine of 1943. His government was replaced by [[Governor's rule]]. After the end of World War II, [[1946 Indian provincial elections|elections were held in 1946]] in which the BPML won an overwhelming majority of 113 seats in the 250-seat assembly. A government under [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] was formed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nalanda Year-book & Who's who in India|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zja2AAAAIAAJ|year=1946}}</ref> Prime Minister Suhrawardy continued with the policy of power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. He also advocated a plan for a Bengali sovereign state with a [[Multiconfessionalism|multiconfessionalist]] political system. The breakdown of Hindu-Muslim unity across India eventually upended Bengali power-sharing. Religious violence, including the [[Noakhali riots]] and [[Direct Action Day]] riots, contributed to the polarization. When the Bengal Assembly met to vote on Partition, most West Bengali legislators held a separate meeting and resolved to partition the province and join the Indian union. Most East Bengali legislators favored an undivided Bengal.\n\nThe Bengal Assembly was divided into the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] during the Partition of British India.\n\n===Civil liberties===\n[[English common law]] was applied to Bengal. Local legislation was enacted by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. [[Case law]] was also an important source of law. Many laws enacted in British Bengal are still in use today, including the [[Indian Penal Code]]. In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] extended wartime powers under the Defence of India Act 1915, including arbitrary arrests and trial without juries. Press freedom was muzzled by the Indian Press Act 1910. The Seditious Meetings Act 1908 curtailed freedom of assembly. Regulation III of 1818 was also considered draconian. King [[George V]] granted a royal amnesty to free political prisoners. Some draconian laws were repealed, including the Rowlatt Act.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gentlemanly-terrorists/reforms-of-1919-montaguchelmsford-the-rowlatt-act-jails-commission-and-the-royal-amnesty/D97CA2DF6D0AEBDD9AD2066DB1504C04/core-reader</ref> Despite being a common law jurisdiction, British India did not enjoy the same level of protection for civil liberties as in the United Kingdom. It was only after independence in 1947 and the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, that human rights were clearly enshrined in law.\n\n===Princely states===\n[[File:Thirteenth Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso.jpg|thumb|upright|The 13th [[Dalai Lama]] in Calcutta in 1910]]\n[[Princely states]] were autonomous principalities under the [[suzerainty]] of the British Crown in India. Initially, the Bengal Presidency managed the British government's relations with most princely states in the northern subcontinent, extending from [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] in the northeast. An [[Agencies of British India|Agency]] was often formed to be the liaison between the government and the princely states. The largest of these agencies under Bengal once included the [[Rajputana Agency]]. Other agencies covered the [[Chota Nagpur Tributary States]] and the [[Orissa Tributary States]]. Agents were also appointed to deal with tribal chiefs, such as the three tribal kings in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the jurisdiction of the [[Bengal States Agency]] included [[Cooch Behar State]] and [[Hill Tipperah]].\n\n===Himalayan kingdoms===\nBengal was strategically important for the Himalayan regions of Nepal, [[Tibet]], Bhutan and Sikkim. The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] between the East India Company and the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] was concluded with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], which ended [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] territorial expansion. The [[Treaty of Titalia]] was signed in 1817 between the HEIC and the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] to establish British hegemony over Sikkim. The [[Bhutan War]] in the 1860s saw the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] lose control of the [[Bengal Duars]] to the British. The [[British Expedition to Tibet]] took place between 1903 and 1904. It resulted in the [[Treaty of Lhasa]] which acknowledged [[Qing China]]'s supremacy over Tibet.\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe [[United States of America]] began sending envoys to Fort William in the 18th-century. President [[George Washington]] nominated Benjamin Joy as the first Consul to Fort William on 19 November 1792. The nomination was supported by the erstwhile Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] and approved by the U. S. Senate on 21 November 1792. Benjamin Joy reached Calcutta in 1794. The HEIC did not recognize Joy as an official consul but allowed him to be a Commercial Agent.<ref>https://in.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/kolkata/</ref> The American [[Consulate General]] was established during formal British rule. A consular agency for Chittagong was created in the 1860s. Many other countries also set up consulates in Calcutta.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:A statue at victoria memorial. kolkata.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Lord William Bentinck]] in Calcutta Victoria Memorial. As Governor-General, Bentinck made English the medium of instruction in schools and phased out Persian.]]\n[[File:Ram Mohan Roy statue.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Raja Ram Mohun Roy]], a native reformer and educationist]]\nBritish rule saw the establishment of [[liberal arts colleges]] in many districts of Bengal. There were only two full-fledged universities in Bengal during British rule, including the University of Calcutta and the University of Dacca. Both universities were represented in the Bengal Legislative Assembly under the Government of India Act, 1935.\n\nPrimary education was mandatory under the Compulsory Education Acts.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Education |title=Education - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Despite significant advances and the emergence of a large educated middle class, most of the population did not have access to a proper education. During 1946\u201347, there were 5,298 high schools with an enrolment of 21,99,000 pupils whereas the corresponding figures for 1916-17 were 1,507 and 57,200. The demand for secondary education increased with the growth of political consciousness amongst the masses. The result was the establishment of schools in villages and towns where backward communities could enroll. Female education too received a good deal of attention during the period. Consequently, between 1921\u201322 and 1946\u201347, the number of educational institutions for girls nearly doubled.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> Some of the leading schools included the [[Oriental Seminary]] in Calcutta, the [[St. Gregory's High School]] in Dacca, the [[Rajshahi Collegiate School]] in Rajshahi and the [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] in Chittagong. European missionaries, Hindu philanthropists and Muslim aristocrats were influential promoters of education. Ethnic minorities maintained their own institutions, such as the Armenian [[Pogose School]].\n\nEach district of Bengal had a [[List of Zilla Schools of Bangladesh|district school]], which were the leading secondary institutions. Due to Calcutta being the colonial capital, the city had a large concentration of educational institutions. It was followed by Dacca, which served as a provincial capital between 1905 and 1912. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the colonial government and the [[Zamindar]]s. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library. [[Northbrook Hall]] was established in 1882 in honor of Governor-General [[Lord Northbrook]]. Other libraries built include the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910).

Ganguly directed and wrote ''[[Bilat Ferat(1921)|Bilat Ferat]]'' in 1921, which was the first production of the Indo British Film Co.

There was a growing cultural awakening in [[Bengali Muslim]] society, including the emergence of [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] as the first Muslim novelist of Bengal; [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] as a celebrated poet who merged Bengali and Hindustani influences; [[Begum Rokeya]] and [[Nawab Faizunnesa]] as feminist educators; [[Kaykobad]] as an epic poet; and members of the [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]].\n\nBengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Pakistan movement]]. The earliest organized anti-colonial groups appeared in Bengal. The region produced many of the subcontinent's political leaders during the early 20th century. Political parties and rebel groups were formed across the region.\n\n===Architecture===\nCivic architecture began following European styles after the advent of the East India Company's authority. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, merging [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], was started by British architects in the late 19th-century. While cities such as Calcutta and Dacca featured more civic architecture, [[country houses]] were built in many towns and villages across Bengal. [[Art deco]] influences began in the 1930s. Wealthy Bengali families (especially [[zamindar]] estates) employed European firms to design houses and palaces. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Architecture in British Bengal\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"180\">\nThe Hooghly Bridge (BOND 0034).jpeg|[[Howrah Bridge]] in 1945\nVictoria Memorial, Calcutta - LIFE.jpg|[[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]]\nWriters Building.jpg|[[Writer's Building]]\nRuplal House old.jpg|[[Ruplal House]]\nCompleted Bridge.

Historians have argued that the British used a policy of [[divide and rule]] among Hindus and Muslims. This meant favoring Hindus over Muslims and vice versa in certain sectors. For example, after the [[Permanent Settlement]], Hindu merchants such as the [[Tagore family]] were awarded large land grants that previously belonged to the Mughal aristocracy. In Calcutta, where Hindus formed a majority, wealthy Muslims were often given favors over Hindus. One aspect that benefitted the Hindu community was increased literacy rates. Many Muslims, however, remained alienated from English education after the abolition of Persian. Bengali society continued to experience religious nationalism which led to the partition of Bengal in 1947.\n\nBritish Bengali cities included a cosmopolitan population, including Armenians and Jews. [[Anglo-Indians]] formed a prominent part of the urban population. Several [[Gentlemen's clubs]] were established, including the [[Bengal Club]], [[Calcutta Club]], [[Dhaka Club|Dacca Club]], [[Chittagong Club]], [[Tollygunge Club]] and [[Saturday Club (Kolkata)|Saturday Club]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of governors of Bengal]]\n* [[Advocate-General of Bengal]]\n\n== References == \n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Works cited == \n{{EB1911|wstitle=Bengal}}\n* [[Christopher Bayly|C.

At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century.\n\nThe Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019).

In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].\n\nBengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name=\"Parthasarathi\">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600\u20131850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself.

The governance of the company was placed in the hands of a governor and a 24-member Court of Directors. The corporation became known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). It rose to account for half of the world's trade. The company was given a monopoly for British trade in the Indian ocean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  \n \nIn 1608, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading post on the west coast of India. It was followed in 1611 by a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] in South India, and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies to trade in the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]] in the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452\u2013472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, as the Nawab of Bengal in [[Murshidabad]] became financially independent with the help of bankers such as the [[Jagat Seth]]. The Nawabs began entering into treaties with numerous European companies, including the [[French East India Company]], the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the [[Danish East India Company]]. The Mughal court in [[Delhi]] was weakened by [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion from Persia (1739) and [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]]'s invasion from Afghanistan (1761). The East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (against the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757) and the [[Battle of Buxar]] (against the Nawabs of Bengal and [[Nawab of Oudh|Oudh]] in 1764) led to the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793. The Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across India and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol.

Acting through [[Lord Cornwallis]], then Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or ''zamindars'', on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the [[Permanent Settlement]] of the Land Revenue. It was designed to \"introduce\" ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.\n\nThe ''Cornwallis Code'', while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ''ryots'' (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of [[opium]] and [[indigo]], the former by the state, and the latter by British planters. Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.\n\nSo unsuccessful was the Permanent Settlement that it was not introduced in the North-Western Provinces (taken from the Marathas during the campaigns of [[Lord Lake]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]) after 1831, in Punjab after its conquest in 1849, or in [[Oudh]] which was annexed in 1856. These regions were nominally part of the Bengal Presidency, but remained administratively distinct. The area of the Presidency under direct administration was sometimes referred to as Lower Bengal to distinguish it from the Presidency as a whole. Officially Punjab, Agra and Allahabad had Lieutenant-Governors subject to the authority of the Governor of Bengal in Calcutta, but in practice they were more or less independent. The only all-Presidency institutions which remained were the Bengal Army and the Civil Service. The Bengal Army was finally amalgamated into the new [[British-Indian Army]] in 1904\u20135, after a lengthy struggle over its reform between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the Commander-in-Chief, and [[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy.\n\n===Straits Settlements===\nIn 1830, the British Straits Settlements on the coast of the [[Malacca Straits]] was made a residency of the Presidency of Bengal in Calcutta. The area included the erstwhile [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Province Wellesley]], as well as the ports of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. Previously, the Straits Settlements (formed by the HEIC in 1826) was administered as a separate presidency with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as the capital. However, the presidency was found to be too costly to administer. Hence, the HEIC decided to reduce the status of the Straits Settlements from a presidency to a residency of the Presidency of Bengal, which was under the governor-general of India based in Calcutta.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> As a residency, all administrative decisions and legislations concerning the Straits Settlements were made in Calcutta, and the governor of the Straits Settlements became a mere resident without executive and legislative powers. Overall, this arrangement proved to be ineffective. Without proper representation in Calcutta and due to the distance between the Straits Settlements and Calcutta, the Indian government found it difficult to advance their interests in the Straits such as by cultivating better ties with the Malay states.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Straits Settlements remained in the Presidency of Bengal for more than three decades. During this period, the Straits Settlements underwent a number of administrative changes. In 1832, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements. In 1851, direct control over the Straits Settlements was transferred to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. Under the administration of the East India Company, the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,<ref>Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857\u20138: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press.

Serious popular agitation followed the step, partly on the grounds that this was part of a cynical policy of divide and rule, and partly that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically dominant under the one, while the bulk would be in the new division. In 1906\u20131909 the unrest developed to a considerable extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and Home governments, and this led to the decision being reversed in 1911.\n\n===Reorganisation of Bengal, 1912===\n[[File:King George V 1911 color-crop.jpg|thumb|In 1911, George V announced the annulment of the first partition of Bengal and the transfer of India's capital from Calcutta to New Delhi]]\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to Delhi, the reunification of the five predominantly Bengali-speaking divisions into a Presidency (or province) of Bengal under a Governor, the creation of a new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] under a lieutenant-governor, and that [[Assam Province]] would be reconstituted under a chief commissioner.

The governor of Bengal was concurrently the governor-general of India for many years. The East India Company maintained control with its private armies and administrative machinery. Nevertheless, the East India Company was a quasi-official entity, having received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1600. The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] caused the British government to assume direct control of India's administration under the [[Government of India Act, 1858]]. The head of state became the [[British monarch]], who was also given the title of [[Emperor of India]]/[[Empress of India]]. The monarch was represented through a viceroy. The [[Viceroy of India]] was based in the Bengal Presidency until 1911. The [[Secretary of State for India]] was also an important official. The Bengal Civil Service managed the provincial government. Modern scholars decry the colonial system as bureaucratic authoritarianism.<ref name=\"JalalJalal1995\">{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor History Ayesha Jalal|author2=Ayesha Jalal|title=Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia: A Comparative and Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHPok4epvlIC|date=6 April 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47862-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\n===Executive councils===\nEstablished by [[Charter Act of 1833]], the [[Council of India|Governor-General in Council]] was subordinate to the Court of Directors of the East India Company and the British Crown. The Governor-General in Council in Fort William enacted legislation, such as the prohibition of Persian as an official language under Act no. XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[File:Calcutta High Court 1860.jpg|thumb|Calcutta High Court, 1860s]]\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] was set up in 1862. The building was designed on the model of [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] in Belgium. The [[Dhaka High Court|Dacca High Court]] building was built during the early 20th century, with elements of a Roman [[Pantheon (Rome)|pantheon]]. District courts were established in all district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. At the district level, tax collectors and revenue officers acted with the power of [[magistrates]]. In 1814, the East India Company pressed the Bengal Government to consider the [[Madras Presidency]]'s model of uniting of judicial and executive powers at the district level. Ultimately Lord Hastings empowered the Governor General-in-Council by Regulation IV of 1821 to authorize the Collectors and Revenue Officers to exercise powers of magistrates. In 1829, magisterial power was given to all Collectors and Revenue Officers. The controversy regarding the lack of [[separation of powers]] continued until 1921. During the period from 1853 to 1921, as many as four reports were prepared on the issue of separation of the judiciary from the executive. The first was in 1893, the second in 1900, the third in 1908 and the fourth in 1913. The Islington Commission was formed by the Secretary of State for India in 1912 to enquire into the problems of judicial administration in India. In its report submitted on August 14, 1915; the Commission opined that legislation would be necessary to effect separation of executive and judicial functions of the officers. Despite these reports, the structure as laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure continued until 1921. On April 5, 1921 the Bengal Legislative Council adopted the following resolution: \"This Council recommends to the Government that early steps be taken for the separation of the judiciary from the executive functions in the administration of this Presidency.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Separation_of_the_Judiciary |title=Separation of the Judiciary - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Council (1862-1947)===\n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Council}}\n{{See also|Legislative Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam}}\n[[File:The Town Hall, Calcutta in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|The Legislative Council met in Calcutta Town Hall]]\nThe British government began to appoint legislative councils under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. The Bengal Legislative Council was established in 1862. It was one of the largest and most important legislative councils in British India. Over the years, the council's powers were gradually expanded from an advisory role to debating government policies and enacting legislation. Under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], the council became the [[upper chamber]] of the Bengali legislature.\n\n===Dyarchy (1920\u201337)===\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, enacted in 1921, expanded the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members to include more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were [[Surendranath Banerjee]] (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921\u20131924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927\u20131928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] (Education 1924). [[Bhupendra Nath Bose]] and [[Abdur Rahim (judge)|Sir Abdur Rahim]] were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Working Of Dyarchy In India 1919 1928|publisher=D.B.Taraporevala Sons And Company.|url=https://archive.org/details/workingofdyarchy029425mbp}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Assembly (1935-1947)===      \n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Assembly}}\n[[File:Bengal PMs.png|thumb|Statesmen who served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]]]\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 established the Bengal Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber of the Bengali legislature. It was a 250-seat assembly where most members were elected by either the General Electorate or the Muslim Electorate (under the [[Communal Award]]). Other members were nominated. The separate electorate dividing Muslims from the general electorate was deeply controversial. The [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] was a member of the assembly.\n\nIn the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|1937 election]], the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] emerged as the single largest party but short of an absolute majority. The second-largest party was the [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]] (BPML), followed in third place by the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. The BPML, Krishak Praja Party and independent legislators formed a coalition government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jalal |first=Ayesha |authorlink=Ayesha Jalal |date=1994 |title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&pg=PA26 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=26\u201327 |isbn=978-0-521-45850-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sanaullah|first1=Muhammad|title=A.K.

Fazlul Huq]], a founder of the BPML who later broke away to form the Krishak Praja Party, was elected as parliamentary leader and prime minister. Huq pursued a policy of [[Hindu-Muslim unity]]. His cabinet included leading Hindu and Muslim figures, including [[Nalini Ranjan Sarkar]] (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja [[Srish Chandra Nandy]] (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab [[Khwaja Habibullah]] (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), [[Musharraf Hussain (nawab)|Nawab Musharraf Hussain]] (judicial and legislative affairs), and [[Syed Nausher Ali]] (public health and local self-government).<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Huq,_AK_Fazlul</ref> Huq promoted financial and [[land reform]]s with the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938), The Money Lenders' Act (1938), and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938). He introduced the Primary Education Bill to make primary education free and compulsory. He established schools such as the [[Lady Brabourne College]]. In 1941, Prime Minister Huq joined the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy's]] Defence Council in support of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war efforts. In a letter to Governor [[John Herbert (Conservative politician)|John Herbert]], Huq called for the resurrection of a Bengal Army. He wrote \"I want you to consent to the formation of a Bengali Army of a hundred thousand young Bengalis consisting of Hindu and Muslim youths on a fifty-fifty basis. There is an insistent demand for such a step being taken at once, and the people of Bengal will not be satisfied with any excuses. It is a national demand which must be immediately conceded\".<ref name=\"thedailystar1\">{{cite web|author=Syed Ashraf Ali |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-60600 |title=Sher-e-Bangla: A natural leader |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> Huq supported the adoption of the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1940. He envisaged Bengal as one of the \"independent states\" outlined by the resolution.\n\nThe first Huq cabinet dissolved after the BPML withdrew from his government. Huq then formed a second coalition with the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] led by [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]]. This cabinet was known as the Shyama-Huq Coalition.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\"/> The cabinet included Nawab Bahabur Khwaja Habibullah, Khan Bahadur Abdul Karim, Khan Bahadur Hashem Ali Khan, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Santosh Kumar Bose and Upendranath Barman. Huq's government fell in 1943 and a BPML government under [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]] as [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Prime Minister]] was formed. Nazimuddin's tenure coincided with the Bengal famine of 1943. His government was replaced by [[Governor's rule]]. After the end of World War II, [[1946 Indian provincial elections|elections were held in 1946]] in which the BPML won an overwhelming majority of 113 seats in the 250-seat assembly. A government under [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] was formed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nalanda Year-book & Who's who in India|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zja2AAAAIAAJ|year=1946}}</ref> Prime Minister Suhrawardy continued with the policy of power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. He also advocated a plan for a Bengali sovereign state with a [[Multiconfessionalism|multiconfessionalist]] political system. The breakdown of Hindu-Muslim unity across India eventually upended Bengali power-sharing. Religious violence, including the [[Noakhali riots]] and [[Direct Action Day]] riots, contributed to the polarization. When the Bengal Assembly met to vote on Partition, most West Bengali legislators held a separate meeting and resolved to partition the province and join the Indian union. Most East Bengali legislators favored an undivided Bengal.\n\nThe Bengal Assembly was divided into the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] during the Partition of British India.\n\n===Civil liberties===\n[[English common law]] was applied to Bengal. Local legislation was enacted by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. [[Case law]] was also an important source of law. Many laws enacted in British Bengal are still in use today, including the [[Indian Penal Code]]. In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] extended wartime powers under the Defence of India Act 1915, including arbitrary arrests and trial without juries. Press freedom was muzzled by the Indian Press Act 1910. The Seditious Meetings Act 1908 curtailed freedom of assembly. Regulation III of 1818 was also considered draconian. King [[George V]] granted a royal amnesty to free political prisoners. Some draconian laws were repealed, including the Rowlatt Act.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gentlemanly-terrorists/reforms-of-1919-montaguchelmsford-the-rowlatt-act-jails-commission-and-the-royal-amnesty/D97CA2DF6D0AEBDD9AD2066DB1504C04/core-reader</ref> Despite being a common law jurisdiction, British India did not enjoy the same level of protection for civil liberties as in the United Kingdom. It was only after independence in 1947 and the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, that human rights were clearly enshrined in law.\n\n===Princely states===\n[[File:Thirteenth Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso.jpg|thumb|upright|The 13th [[Dalai Lama]] in Calcutta in 1910]]\n[[Princely states]] were autonomous principalities under the [[suzerainty]] of the British Crown in India. Initially, the Bengal Presidency managed the British government's relations with most princely states in the northern subcontinent, extending from [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] in the northeast. An [[Agencies of British India|Agency]] was often formed to be the liaison between the government and the princely states. The largest of these agencies under Bengal once included the [[Rajputana Agency]]. Other agencies covered the [[Chota Nagpur Tributary States]] and the [[Orissa Tributary States]]. Agents were also appointed to deal with tribal chiefs, such as the three tribal kings in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the jurisdiction of the [[Bengal States Agency]] included [[Cooch Behar State]] and [[Hill Tipperah]].\n\n===Himalayan kingdoms===\nBengal was strategically important for the Himalayan regions of Nepal, [[Tibet]], Bhutan and Sikkim. The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] between the East India Company and the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] was concluded with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], which ended [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] territorial expansion. The [[Treaty of Titalia]] was signed in 1817 between the HEIC and the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] to establish British hegemony over Sikkim. The [[Bhutan War]] in the 1860s saw the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] lose control of the [[Bengal Duars]] to the British. The [[British Expedition to Tibet]] took place between 1903 and 1904. It resulted in the [[Treaty of Lhasa]] which acknowledged [[Qing China]]'s supremacy over Tibet.\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe [[United States of America]] began sending envoys to Fort William in the 18th-century. President [[George Washington]] nominated Benjamin Joy as the first Consul to Fort William on 19 November 1792. The nomination was supported by the erstwhile Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] and approved by the U. S. Senate on 21 November 1792. Benjamin Joy reached Calcutta in 1794. The HEIC did not recognize Joy as an official consul but allowed him to be a Commercial Agent.<ref>https://in.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/kolkata/</ref> The American [[Consulate General]] was established during formal British rule. A consular agency for Chittagong was created in the 1860s. Many other countries also set up consulates in Calcutta.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:A statue at victoria memorial. kolkata.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Lord William Bentinck]] in Calcutta Victoria Memorial.

There were only two full-fledged universities in Bengal during British rule, including the University of Calcutta and the University of Dacca. Both universities were represented in the Bengal Legislative Assembly under the Government of India Act, 1935.\n\nPrimary education was mandatory under the Compulsory Education Acts.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Education |title=Education - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Despite significant advances and the emergence of a large educated middle class, most of the population did not have access to a proper education. During 1946-47, there were 5,298 high schools with an enrolment of 21,99,000 pupils whereas the corresponding figures for 1916-17 were 1,507 and 57,200. The demand for secondary education increased with the growth of political consciousness amongst the masses. The result was the establishment of schools in villages and towns where backward communities could enroll. Female education too received a good deal of attention during the period. Consequently, between 1921\u201322 and 1946\u201347, the number of educational institutions for girls nearly doubled.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> Some of the leading schools included the [[Oriental Seminary]] in Calcutta, the [[St. Gregory's High School]] in Dacca, the [[Rajshahi Collegiate School]] in Rajshahi and the [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] in Chittagong. European missionaries, Hindu philanthropists and Muslim aristocrats were influential promoters of education. Ethnic minorities maintained their own institutions, such as the Armenian [[Pogose School]].\n\nEach district of Bengal had a [[List of Zilla Schools of Bangladesh|district school]], which were the leading secondary institutions. Due to Calcutta being the colonial capital, the city had a large concentration of educational institutions. It was followed by Dacca, which served as a provincial capital between 1905 and 1912. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the colonial government and the [[Zamindar]]s. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library. [[Northbrook Hall]] was established in 1882 in honor of Governor-General [[Lord Northbrook]]. Other libraries built include the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910).

Initially, the English East India Company promoted opium cultivation which caused the [[Opium Wars]] with [[Qing China]]. The East India Company's promotion of indigo farming caused the [[Indigo revolt]]. The British were much criticized for favoring textile imports and suppressing local [[muslin]] production. The chaos of the Company rule period culminated in the [[Indian Mutiny]] in 1857. In 1858, the British government gained direct control of Indian administration. Bengal was plugged into the market-driven economy and trade networks of the [[British Empire]].\n\nThe Bengal Presidency had the largest gross domestic product in British India.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.daily-sun.com/home/printnews/218795 |title=Reimagining the Colonial Bengal Presidency Template (Part I) |publisher=Daily sun |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> The first British colonial banks in the Indian subcontinent were founded in Bengal.

The Permanent Settlement enforced a system in which peasants were indebted to the Zamindars. The peasants rented land from the Zamindars and became tenant farmers. Strong control of land by the Zamindars meant the British had few headaches in exploiting trade and business. However, Bengal received little attention for industrialization due to the entrenched peasant-zamindar relationship under the Permanent Settlement.<ref>https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/30f0/3c45a7353c581c40ac39dbe4ee88621304a2.pdf</ref> The [[Zamindars of Bengal]] built mansions, lodges, modern bungalows, townhouses, and palaces on their estates.

The literary polymath [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1913. The cultural activist [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] gained popularity as British India's ''Rebel Poet''. [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] pioneered Bengali science fiction. [[Begum Rokeya]], author of ''[[Sultana's Dream]]'', became an early feminist science fiction author.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:1780-01-29 Berkeley Page 1a.png|thumb|left|The frontpage of ''Hicky's Bengal Gazette'' on 29 January 1780]]\nNumerous newspapers were published in British Bengal since the 18th-century. Many were in English. ''[[Hicky's Bengal Gazette]]'' was a major weekly publication. The first Bengali periodicals appeared in the 19th-century.  The ''Calcutta Journal'' became the first daily newspaper in British India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Newspapers_and_Periodicals |title=Newspapers and Periodicals - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Other newspapers included the ''[[Dacca News]]'' and ''[[The Bengal Times]]''.

European photographers also worked in the region. The modernist [[Bengal school]] of painting evolved in the province. European sculptures were widely imported by wealthy Zamindars. In the 1940s, [[Zainul Abedin]] emerged as a modernist painter depicting poverty and the Bengal famine.\n\n===Calcutta Time===\n[[Calcutta Time]] was the [[time zone]] of the Bengal Presidency. It was established in 1884. It was one of the two time zones of British India.

The first Bengali feature film, ''[[Billwamangal]]'', was produced and released in 1919 under the banner of the Madan Theatre. The movie was directed by Rustomji Dhotiwala and produced by Priyonath Ganguli. A Bengali film company called the [[Indo British Film Co]] was soon formed in Calcutta by [[Dhirendra Nath Ganguly]]. Ganguly directed and wrote ''[[Bilat Ferat(1921)|Bilat Ferat]]'' in 1921, which was the first production of the Indo British Film Co.

In addition to horse races, the club also launched [[polo]] matches among natives and colonialists.

There was a growing cultural awakening in [[Bengali Muslim]] society, including the emergence of [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] as the first Muslim novelist of Bengal; [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] as a celebrated poet who merged Bengali and Hindustani influences; [[Begum Rokeya]] and [[Nawab Faizunnesa]] as feminist educators; [[Kaykobad]] as an epic poet; and members of the [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]].\n\nBengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Pakistan movement]]. The earliest organized anti-colonial groups appeared in Bengal. The region produced many of the subcontinent's political leaders during the early 20th century. Political parties and rebel groups were formed across the region.\n\n===Architecture===\nCivic architecture began following European styles after the advent of the East India Company's authority. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, merging [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], was started by British architects in the late 19th-century. While cities such as Calcutta and Dacca featured more civic architecture, [[country houses]] were built in many towns and villages across Bengal. [[Art deco]] influences began in the 1930s. Wealthy Bengali families (especially [[zamindar]] estates) employed European firms to design houses and palaces. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Architecture in British Bengal\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"180\">\nThe Hooghly Bridge (BOND 0034).jpeg|[[Howrah Bridge]] in 1945\nVictoria Memorial, Calcutta - LIFE.jpg|[[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]]\nWriters Building.jpg|[[Writer's Building]]\nRuplal House old.jpg|[[Ruplal House]]\nCompleted Bridge.

Historians have argued that the British used a policy of [[divide and rule]] among Hindus and Muslims. This meant favoring Hindus over Muslims and vice versa in certain sectors. For example, after the [[Permanent Settlement]], Hindu merchants such as the [[Tagore family]] were awarded large land grants that previously belonged to the Mughal aristocracy. In Calcutta, where Hindus formed a majority, wealthy Muslims were often given favors over Hindus. One aspect that benefitted the Hindu community was increased literacy rates. Many Muslims, however, remained alienated from English education after the abolition of Persian. Bengali society continued to experience religious nationalism which led to the partition of Bengal in 1947.\n\nBritish Bengali cities included a cosmopolitan population, including Armenians and Jews. [[Anglo-Indians]] formed a prominent part of the urban population. Several [[Gentlemen's clubs]] were established, including the [[Bengal Club]], [[Calcutta Club]], [[Dhaka Club|Dacca Club]], [[Chittagong Club]], [[Tollygunge Club]] and [[Saturday Club (Kolkata)|Saturday Club]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of governors of Bengal]]\n* [[Advocate-General of Bengal]]\n\n== References == \n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Works cited == \n{{EB1911|wstitle=Bengal}}\n* [[Christopher Bayly|C.

{"title_page": "1922 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1922}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

"text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1922}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

The games were played over the space of just 8 days.\n\nAfter the [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby league team|NZ M\u0101ori]] team returned from their tour of Australia seven members of their team were transferred to the Fire Brigade Club, though only four played in their round 9 match (Pitman, Gardner, Yeats and Te Whata).\n\nHistory was made on 2 September when [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] was defeated for the first time in a Northern Union Challenge Cup match. They had held the Cup for over a decade, but had to hand it over when they were defeated by [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] 21 to 20 on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of a large crowd. On 16 September they met the touring New South Wales team at the [[Auckland Domain]] and in front of a huge crowd of 20,000 they went down in a \u201ctremendously fast and exciting game\u201d by 45 points to 25.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =New South Wales Team\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18198\n| date = 1922-09-20\n| url
