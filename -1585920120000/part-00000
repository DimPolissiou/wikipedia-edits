Amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available,<ref>Roy, D. et al. Amiodarone to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2000;342:913-920</ref><ref>Singh, B.N., et al. Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2005;352:1861-1872</ref><ref>Kochiadakis, G.E., et al. Low dose amiodarone and sotalol in the treatment of recurrent, symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a comparative, placebo controlled study.

Structure-activity relationships and electrophysiological effects of short-acting amiodarone homologs in guinea pig isolated heart. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001;297:260-266</ref> are discouraging its use. Budiodarone only differs in structure from amiodarone through the presence of a [[sec-Butyl acetate|''sec''-butyl acetate]] side chain at position 2 of the [[benzofuran]] moiety.<ref>Mason, P.K., DiMarco, P. Advances in Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology. Circulation. 2009;2:588-597</ref> This side chain allows for budiodarone to have a shorter [[half-life]] in the body than amiodarone (7 hours versus 35\u201368 days) which allows it to have a faster onset of action and metabolism while still maintaining similar electrophysiological activity.<ref name=\"Morey\" /> The faster metabolism of budiodarone allows for fewer adverse side effects than amiodarone principally due to decreased levels of toxicity in the body.\n\n==Creation of arrythmias==\n[[Arrhythmias]] may be caused by changes in ion channel mRNA and protein expression which modify [[action potential]] generation through dysfunctional channels and increase the likelihood of inappropriate electrical re-entry (electrical stimulus entering back into the cell to prematurely start the next action potential).<ref>Bosch, R.F., Nattel, S. Cellular electrophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Cardiovasc Res. 2002;54:259-269</ref> The increase in electrical re-entry causes the [[fibrillation]] or uncontrolled action potential discord of [[atrial myocytes]]. Arrhythmias have historically been treated using atrial [[ablation]] or antiarrhythmic drugs to decrease electrical re-entry and therefore fibrillation.\n\n==Treatment of arrhythmias==\nBudiodarone holds much promise as an antiarrhythmic drug to prevent fibrillation. As a drug that spans over many of antiarrhythmic drug classes, the electrophysiological activity of budiodarone includes:<ref name=\"Morey\" />\n\n===Inhibition of potassium, sodium and calcium channels===\nThrough inhibiting potassium channels, budiodarone causes a decreased efflux of potassium out of the myocyte during the [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of its action potential, increasing the time it takes to reach the resting [[membrane potential]].\n\nThrough blocking sodium channels, budiodarone causes a decrease in sodium influx into myocytes during the [[depolarization]] period of its action potential.\n\nThrough blocking calcium channels, budiodarone causes a decrease in calcium influx into myocytes, decreasing intracellular calcium and decreasing cardiac [[contractility]], which is beneficial in preventing arrhythmias, but detrimental in ventricular contraction.\n\n===Increase in atrial myocyte refractory period===\nThrough prolonging the refractory and depolarization periods of the action potential, there is a decreased likelihood that electrical re-entry will occur.\n\n===Increased stimulus-to-atrium and atrium-to-bundle of his intervals===\nIncreasing the time interval between stimulus to atrium and/or atrium to [[bundle of his]] in action potential conduction slows the rate of myocyte contraction, thereby slowing heart rate.\n\n===Increased MAPD90 and QT-intervals===\nIncreasing the time interval of MAPD90 (response of monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization) and/or [[QT interval|QT]] in action potential conduction slows the rate of myocyte contraction, thereby slowing heart rate.\n\n===Dose-dependent decrease in heart rate===\nA decrease in heart rate reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation.\n\n==Clinical trials==\nPreliminary trials of budiodarone have administered the drug orally as a [[tartrate]] salt in amounts ranging from 200\u2013800&nbsp;mg bid.<ref name=\"Arya\">Arya, A. et al.

Amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available,<ref>Roy, D. et al. Amiodarone to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2000;342:913-920</ref><ref>Singh, B.N., et al. Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2005;352:1861-1872</ref><ref>Kochiadakis, G.E., et al. Low dose amiodarone and sotalol in the treatment of recurrent, symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a comparative, placebo controlled study. Heart. 2000;84:251-257</ref> but its adverse side effects, including hepatic, pulmonary and thyroid toxicity as well as multiple drug interactions,<ref name=\"Morey\">Morey, T.E. et al. Structure-activity relationships and electrophysiological effects of short-acting amiodarone homologs in guinea pig isolated heart. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001;297:260-266</ref> are discouraging its use. Budiodarone only differs in structure from amiodarone through the presence of a [[sec-Butyl acetate|''sec''-butyl acetate]] side chain at position 2 of the [[benzofuran]] moiety.<ref>Mason, P.K., DiMarco, P. Advances in Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology. Circulation. 2009;2:588-597</ref> This side chain allows for budiodarone to have a shorter [[half-life]] in the body than amiodarone (7 hours versus 35\u201368 days) which allows it to have a faster onset of action and metabolism while still maintaining similar electrophysiological activity.<ref name=\"Morey\" /> The faster metabolism of budiodarone allows for fewer adverse side effects than amiodarone principally due to decreased levels of toxicity in the body.\n\n==Creation of arrythmias==\n[[Arrhythmias]] may be caused by changes in ion channel mRNA and protein expression which modify [[action potential]] generation through dysfunctional channels and increase the likelihood of inappropriate electrical re-entry (electrical stimulus entering back into the cell to prematurely start the next action potential).<ref>Bosch, R.F., Nattel, S. Cellular electrophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Cardiovasc Res. 2002;54:259-269</ref> The increase in electrical re-entry causes the [[fibrillation]] or uncontrolled action potential discord of [[atrial myocytes]]. Arrhythmias have historically been treated using atrial [[ablation]] or antiarrhythmic drugs to decrease electrical re-entry and therefore fibrillation.\n\n==Treatment of arrhythmias==\nBudiodarone holds much promise as an antiarrhythmic drug to prevent fibrillation. As a drug that spans over many of antiarrhythmic drug classes, the electrophysiological activity of budiodarone includes:<ref name=\"Morey\" />\n\n===Inhibition of potassium, sodium and calcium channels===\nThrough inhibiting potassium channels, budiodarone causes a decreased efflux of potassium out of the myocyte during the [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of its action potential, increasing the time it takes to reach the resting [[membrane potential]].\n\nThrough blocking sodium channels, budiodarone causes a decrease in sodium influx into myocytes during the [[depolarization]] period of its action potential.\n\nThrough blocking calcium channels, budiodarone causes a decrease in calcium influx into myocytes, decreasing intracellular calcium and decreasing cardiac [[contractility]], which is beneficial in preventing arrhythmias, but detrimental in ventricular contraction.\n\n===Increase in atrial myocyte refractory period===\nThrough prolonging the refractory and depolarization periods of the action potential, there is a decreased likelihood that electrical re-entry will occur.\n\n===Increased stimulus-to-atrium and atrium-to-bundle of his intervals===\nIncreasing the time interval between stimulus to atrium and/or atrium to [[bundle of his]] in action potential conduction slows the rate of myocyte contraction, thereby slowing heart rate.\n\n===Increased MAPD90 and QT-intervals===\nIncreasing the time interval of MAPD90 (response of monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization) and/or [[QT interval|QT]] in action potential conduction slows the rate of myocyte contraction, thereby slowing heart rate.\n\n===Dose-dependent decrease in heart rate===\nA decrease in heart rate reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation.\n\n==Clinical trials==\nPreliminary trials of budiodarone have administered the drug orally as a [[tartrate]] salt in amounts ranging from 200\u2013800&nbsp;mg bid.<ref name=\"Arya\">Arya, A. et al.

He previously managed [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] from November 2018 to August 2019. A [[centre back]], he had a 20-year career playing in the [[Premier League]] and an 11-year international career with the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nBorn in [[North East (London sub region)|east London]] to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the team to victory in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a free transfer, and as a result has known as \u2018Judas\u2019 and has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two [[FA Cup]] winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|double]], and being part of the team that became known as ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'' for their undefeated [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|2003\u201304 Premier League campaign]]. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In August 2006, he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]] to join League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHaving already won caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] and [[England national football B team|England B team]], Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after [[Bobby Moore]], aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced an (ultimately unsuccessful) ambition to become the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] nominee for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 election]].<ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/sol-campbell-confirms-intentions-to-run-for-london-mayor-i-have-got-so-much-to-offer-10071666.html|title=Sol Campbell confirms his intentions to run for this high-powered political role|date=26 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCampbell was born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.<ref>{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=5}}</ref> He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=2}}</ref> His father Sewell was a railway worker and his mother Wihelmina was a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker.<ref name=\"page 2\"/> Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood to a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/inside-the-mind-of-sol-campbell-411153.html |title=Inside the mind of Sol Campbell |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2010 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"I became a recluse within my own house.

He previously managed [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] from November 2018 to August 2019. A [[centre back]], he had a 20-year career playing in the [[Premier League]] and an 11-year international career with the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nBorn in [[North East (London sub region)|east London]] to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the team to victory in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a free transfer, and as a result has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two [[FA Cup]] winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|double]], and being part of the team that became known as ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'' for their undefeated [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|2003\u201304 Premier League campaign]]. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In August 2006, he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]] to join League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHaving already won caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] and [[England national football B team|England B team]], Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after [[Bobby Moore]], aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced an (ultimately unsuccessful) ambition to become the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] nominee for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 election]].<ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/sol-campbell-confirms-intentions-to-run-for-london-mayor-i-have-got-so-much-to-offer-10071666.html|title=Sol Campbell confirms his intentions to run for this high-powered political role|date=26 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCampbell was born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.<ref>{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=5}}</ref> He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=2}}</ref> His father Sewell was a railway worker and his mother Wihelmina was a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker.<ref name=\"page 2\"/> Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood to a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/inside-the-mind-of-sol-campbell-411153.html |title=Inside the mind of Sol Campbell |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2010 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"I became a recluse within my own house.

Directly north-west, Affetside Moor rises to a height of more than 900&nbsp;ft above sea level and further north Top of Quarlton and Holcombe Moor dominate the skyline. From elevated parts of the town Scout Moor, Harden Moor and Knowl Hill are visible to the east. The villages of Affetside, Greenmount and Hawkshaw are north of the town, with Walshaw to the south west. Until the post-war period Tottington was a ribbon development along the Bury to Blackburn road, the Kirklees Valley to the east stopped development in that direction and kept Tottington distinct from [[Brandlesholme]]. Within the Kirklees Valley there are a number of artificial mill ponds and reservoirs created during Tottington's industrial heyday.

At that point, it eliminated music and switched to a [[talk radio|news/talk]] format.  WBBM adopted its current all-news format in May 1968 (after co-owned [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] [[New York City]] switched to all news in 1967 and [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] [[Los Angeles]] made the change in Spring of 1968).  The station has been the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] of the [[Chicago Bears]] since 2000, and in its history has also aired [[Chicago White Sox]] [[baseball]] games and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] [[NHL|hockey]] games.\n\nOver the years, WBBM fended off competition from other all-news stations that were attempted in the Chicago [[media market|radio market]]: [[George McLendon|McLendon]]-owned WNUS-AM-FM (1390 AM, now [[WGRB]] and 107.5 FM, now [[WGCI-FM]]), [[NBC]]'s 101.1 WNIS-FM (now [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]]) and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]]'s 670 [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] (now [[WSCR]]), which came under the CBS umbrella when [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] purchased CBS in 1995. \n\nFrom the 1950s through the 90s, WBBM had been in a spirited battle with rival news/talk/sports station 720 [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] for the position of the #1 radio station in the Chicago market. In the June 2009 ratings period, as estimated by [[Arbitron]], WGN held a slight edge over WBBM in [[Portable People Meter|PPM]]-metered listener ratings. However, since the fall of 2009, WBBM has maintained a lead while WGN's listenership began to decline. \n\n===FM simulcast===\nAnother challenge to WBBM's news radio domination came from Merlin Media (operated by former Tribune Company executive [[Randy Michaels]]).  Michaels purchased FM station 101.1 [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]] (the successor to WNIS-FM) in June 2011 and flipped formats.  He began the female-focused ''FM News 101.1'' the next month.  But on August 1, 2011, CBS launched a [[simulcast]] of WBBM on co-owned 105.9 [[WCFS-FM]]. For years, WBBM had been plagued by a marginal signal in downtown Chicago, particularly in office buildings.  WCFS-FM helps improve WBBM's coverage where the AM signal is not strong. Additionally, the FM simulcast helped increase listenership among younger listeners, who rarely switch over to AM. \n\nPreviously, WBBM had been simulcast since 2009 over WCFS-[[HD Radio|HD2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/14850277/it's-official-cbs-to-expand-newsradio-brand-with-fm-simulca|title=It's official: CBS to expand Newsradio brand with FM simulcast|last=Feder|first=Robert|date=15 July 2011|publisher=[[Time Out Chicago]]|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> The FM station's call letters were retained and should not be confused with [[WBBM-FM]], a [[contemporary hit radio|CHR/Top 40]] station.  WCFS-FM's former [[adult contemporary]] format moved to the HD2 channel, effectively switching signals with WBBM's audio.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\nOn June 5, 2014, the [[Chicago Cubs]] announced that the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station for their [[Chicago Cubs Radio Network|radio broadcasts]] would move from 720 [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] to WBBM for the 2015 season under a seven-year deal. The switch to WBBM ended the team's 90-year association with WGN.  The station had broadcast Cubs games from its establishment in 1924, became its exclusive broadcaster in 1958, and was co-owned with the Cubs by [[Tribune Company]] from 1981 to 2009.  \n\nCubs games were only broadcast on WBBM's AM feed.

At that point, it eliminated music and switched to a [[talk radio|news/talk]] format.  WBBM adopted its current all-news format in May 1968 (after co-owned [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] [[New York City]] switched to all news in 1967 and [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] [[Los Angeles]] made the change in Spring of 1968).  The station has been the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] of the [[Chicago Bears]] since 2000, and in its history has also aired [[Chicago White Sox]] [[baseball]] games and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] [[NHL|hockey]] games.\n\nOver the years, WBBM fended off competition from other all-news stations that were attempted in the Chicago [[media market|radio market]]: [[George McLendon|McLendon]]-owned WNUS-AM-FM (1390 AM, now [[WGRB]] and 107.5 FM, now [[WGCI-FM]]), [[NBC]]'s 101.1 WNIS-FM (now [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]]) and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]]'s 670 [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] (now [[WSCR]]), which came under the CBS umbrella when [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] purchased CBS in 1995. \n\nFrom the 1950s through the 90s, WBBM had been in a spirited battle with rival news/talk/sports station 720 [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] for the position of the #1 radio station in the Chicago market. In the June 2009 ratings period, as estimated by [[Arbitron]], WGN held a slight edge over WBBM in [[Portable People Meter|PPM]]-metered listener ratings. However, since the fall of 2009, WBBM has maintained a lead while WGN's listenership began to decline. \n\n===FM simulcast===\nAnother challenge to WBBM's news radio domination came from Merlin Media (operated by former Tribune Company executive [[Randy Michaels]]).  Michaels purchased FM station 101.1 [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]] (the successor to WNIS-FM) in June 2011 and flipped formats.  He began the female-focused ''FM News 101.1'' the next month.  But on August 1, 2011, CBS launched a [[simulcast]] of WBBM on co-owned 105.9 [[WCFS-FM]]. For years, WBBM had been plagued by a marginal signal in downtown Chicago, particularly in office buildings.  WCFS-FM helps improve WBBM's coverage where the AM signal is not strong. Additionally, the FM simulcast helped increase listenership among younger listeners, who rarely switch over to AM. \n\nPreviously, WBBM had been simulcast since 2009 over WCFS-[[HD Radio|HD2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/14850277/it's-official-cbs-to-expand-newsradio-brand-with-fm-simulca|title=It's official: CBS to expand Newsradio brand with FM simulcast|last=Feder|first=Robert|date=15 July 2011|publisher=[[Time Out Chicago]]|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> The FM station's call letters were retained and should not be confused with [[WBBM-FM]], a [[contemporary hit radio|CHR/Top 40]] station.  WCFS-FM's former [[adult contemporary]] format moved to the HD2 channel, effectively switching signals with WBBM's audio.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\nOn June 5, 2014, the [[Chicago Cubs]] announced that the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station for their [[Chicago Cubs Radio Network|radio broadcasts]] would move from 720 [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] to WBBM for the 2015 season under a seven-year deal. The switch to WBBM ended the team's 90-year association with WGN.  The station had broadcast Cubs games from its establishment in 1924, became its exclusive broadcaster in 1958, and was co-owned with the Cubs by [[Tribune Company]] from 1981 to 2009.  \n\nCubs games were only broadcast on WBBM's AM feed.  While the games were being played, 105.9 WCFS-FM could continue to broadcast WBBM's regular all-news programming uninterrupted.<ref name=chctrb-wbbmcubs>{{cite web|title=Cubs, WBBM make radio deal official|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-cubs-wgn-wbbm-radio-20140605,0,5683316.story|website=Chicago Tribune|date=June 5, 2014|author=Robert Channick|accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe arrangement lasted only one season.  After co-owned [[sports radio]] station 670 [[WSCR]] lost the [[White Sox]] to 890 [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] for the 2016 season, an option was invoked which moved the Cubs to WSCR, giving the sports station another Chicago baseball team.<ref name=suntimes-cubswscr>{{cite web|title=Cubs make their radio move to WSCR official|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1091613/cubs-make-radio-move-wscr-official|website=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 11, 2015|author=Kyle Thele|accessdate=17 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117224156/http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1091613/cubs-make-radio-move-wscr-official|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-04/business/chi-cubs-radio-wgn-wbbm-20140603_1_chicago-cubs-new-radio-home-pat-hughes|title=WBBM to be Cubs' new radio home|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 4, 2014|author=Robert Channick|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WSCR-AM 670 The Score Named The Cubs' New Flagship Station|url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/11/11/wscr-am-670-the-score-named-the-cubs-new-flagship-station/|website=chicago.cbslocal.com|date=November 11, 2015|publisher=CBS Chicago|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>  Interestingly, WLS only aired White Sox games for one season.  In 2017, the White Sox relocated to WGN.  \n\n===Entercom ownership===\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with [[Entercom]], the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States.  The sale was conducted using a [[Reverse Morris Trust]] to avoid a tax liability.  While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating the WBBM radio stations (both 780 and [[WBBM-FM|FM 96.3]]) plus WCFS-FM from Channel 2 [[WBBM-TV]]. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.<ref name=\"variety-cbsentercom\">{{cite web|title=CBS Sets Radio Division Merger With Entercom|author=Cynthia Littleton|date=February 2, 2017|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/cbs-entercom-radio-division-merger-1201976392/|website=Variety|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2017/02/02/cbs-entercom-radio-merger/|title=CBS and Entercom Are Merging Their Radio Stations (Reuters)|date=February 2, 2017|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.entercom.com/entercom-receives-fcc-approval-for-merger-with-cbs-radio#.Wg54UWVqaNZ \"Entercom Receives FCC Approval for Merger with CBS Radio\"] (Press release), November 9, 2017 (entercom.com)</ref><ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/121072/entercom-completes-cbs-radio-merger/ \"Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger\"] by Lance Venta, February 24, 2018 (radioinsight.com)</ref> \n\nDespite the ownership change, WBBM radio and WBBM-TV maintain a partnership, with WBBM radio making use of some WBBM-TV local news and weather reporting. On March 1, 2018, Entercom launched a new website for WBBM alone on the company's [[Radio.com]] portal, breaking it off from the former CBS Chicago portal.\n\nShortly after the move of the transmitter to the WSCR site, WBBM adjusted its news wheel for some segments for the first time in decades, presumably due to lengthening traffic reports and the adjustment of some ad breaks. The sports news segment moved to :16/:46, with business news coverage moving to :23/:53 past the hour, and hourly feature segments moving to :21 past the hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wbbm780.radio.com/shows/wbbm-newsradio-3|title=WBBM Newsradio|accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Relocating the transmitter===\nIn 2018, WBBM was granted an FCC [[construction permit]] to move its transmitter to WSCR's tower site in [[Bloomingdale, Illinois|Bloomingdale]].
