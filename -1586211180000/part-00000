He spent his early years growing up with his great-grandmother Aulga Clarke in [[Homestead, Florida]] and later moved to his father's home at the age of 11. Taylor was baptized at the Bethel Seventh-day Adventist Church in [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]] by Pastor David Peay.

He originally began his high school football career at [[Miami Killian High School]], a Class 2A public school, but transferred to [[Gulliver Preparatory School]], a Class prep school, where he was a three-sport star in football, track and basketball. He played both [[Offense (sports)|offense]] and [[Defense (sport)|defense]]. Despite missing the first game of the season (the team's only loss), he helped Gulliver win the Florida Class 2A State Championship in 2000 with a 14\u20131 record. Taylor was a star on both sides of the ball during that season, playing [[running back]], [[defensive back]] and [[linebacker]].<ref name=heraldupdate1>Beras, Erika. [http://www.miamiherald.com/588/story/321952.html NFL's Taylor responsive after shooting]. ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. November 27, 2007.</ref> He rushed for 1,400 yards and a state-record 44 touchdowns and on two separate occasions, rushed for more than 200 yards during Gulliver's state playoff run. He also compiled more than 100 tackles during the season and scored three touchdowns (two receiving, one rushing) in the state title game victory over [[Marianna High School]]. In [[track & field]], Taylor won the state 2A [[100-meter dash]] in 2000 and was also one of the state's top [[400-meter dash]] sprinters. At Gulliver, Taylor was a teammate of future NFL player [[Buck Ortega]]. His championship HS team was coached by [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], Ralph Ortega, Dirk Moran, Lee Horn, Dave Burns, and John McCloskey.\n\nTaylor was considered the No. 1 prospect in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. He was also rated the nation's No. 1 skill athlete and an All-American by ''[[Super Prep]]''. Taylor was also an ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' Super Southern Team selection, the No. 1 athlete on the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' Super 75 list and rated the No. 1 player in Florida by ''[[The Gainesville Sun]]''.\n\nIn 2007, he was also named to the [[FHSAA's All-Century Team|Florida High School Association All-Century Team]], which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state. After his death, Taylor was honored at Gulliver by a plaque that was placed in the school's cafeteria.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3135111 | work=ESPN | title=In life, and in death, Taylor was a natural mystery | date=December 2, 2007}}</ref> The football field at Gulliver Prep was renamed Sean Taylor Memorial Field on September 5, 2009.\n\n==College career==\nTaylor was recruited to play for coach [[Larry Coker]]'s [[Miami Hurricanes football]] team at the [[University of Miami]]. He was also a member of the Hurricanes [[track & field]] team, competing in events such as the 100-meter and 200-meters.\n\n===2001 season===\nAs a freshman (one of four true freshmen to play for the team), Taylor carved a niche for himself in Miami's secondary in nickel and dime defensive schemes. During the season, Taylor was named Big East [[Big East Conference football awards|Special Teams Player of the Week]] for his performance against the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]].<ref name=heraldupdate1 /> The Hurricanes won the national championship in 2001.\n\n===2002 season===\nIn 2002, his first season as a starter, Taylor was a second-team All-Big East selection by the league's head coaches. He finished third on the team in tackles with 85 (53 solo), broke up 15 passes, intercepted 4 passes, forced one fumble, blocked one kick and returned a punt for a touchdown. He led all Miami defensive backs in tackles, interceptions and passes broken up, and had a career-high 11 tackles (2 solo) and intercepted 2 passes in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] loss to [[Ohio State University football|Ohio State]]. He made a critical play during the game, in which he intercepted Buckeyes quarterback [[Craig Krenzel]] in the endzone and returned the ball out of the endzone. Buckeyes running back [[Maurice Clarett]] ran Taylor down, and in the process stripped the ball away from him. Clarett recovered the ball for Ohio State, allowing them to kick a field goal to go up 17\u20137 at the time.\n\n===2003 season===\nTaylor produced a historic season during his final year at Miami that culminated with a plethora of honors and awards. He was named a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big East Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the [[Jim Thorpe Award]], given to the nation's best defensive back. He led the Big East Conference and ranked first nationally in interceptions with 10, tying the record for interceptions in a season with former Hurricanes standout [[Bennie Blades]]. Taylor also finished first in total tackles with 77 (57 solo). He intercepted two passes in Miami's impressive 28\u201314 win over [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], playing a key role as the Hurricanes limited All-American receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]] to just three receptions for 26 yards. He returned interceptions for an average of 18.4 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown return at [[Boston College football|Boston College]], a 50-yard scoring runback at [[Florida State University football|Florida State]] and a 44-yard scoring runback against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]]. His three touchdown returns of interceptions is a Miami single-season record.\n\nTaylor also competed in [[track & field]] as a senior for the Hurricanes. He placed 4th in the 100-meter at the Gatorade Invitational in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] with a time of 10.77 seconds, behind teammates Terrell Walden, [[Roscoe Parrish]] and Travarous Bain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-04-20/sports/0304200210_1_lake-howell-lake-brantley-rivers|title=Rivers Flowing To Top Of Charts|publisher=}}</ref> His best efforts for the season came at the Big East Outdoor T&F Championships in [[Storrs, Connecticut]], where he ran personal-bests of 10.74 seconds in the [[100-meter dash]] and 21.60 seconds in the [[200-meter dash]].<ref>http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mifl/sports/m-track/auto_pdf/m-track-outdoor-perfs03.pdf</ref> He also participated as a member of the 4x100 relay.\n\n===College statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| !!colspan=5| Defense\n|-\n!

He played both [[Offense (sports)|offense]] and [[Defense (sport)|defense]]. Despite missing the first game of the season (the team's only loss), he helped Gulliver win the Florida Class 2A State Championship in 2000 with a 14\u20131 record. Taylor was a star on both sides of the ball during that season, playing [[running back]], [[defensive back]] and [[linebacker]].<ref name=heraldupdate1>Beras, Erika. [http://www.miamiherald.com/588/story/321952.html NFL's Taylor responsive after shooting]. ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.

He also compiled more than 100 tackles during the season and scored three touchdowns (two receiving, one rushing) in the state title game victory over [[Marianna High School]]. In [[track & field]], Taylor won the state 2A [[100-meter dash]] in 2000 and was also one of the state's top [[400-meter dash]] sprinters. At Gulliver, Taylor was a teammate of future NFL player [[Buck Ortega]]. His championship HS team was coached by [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], Ralph Ortega, Dirk Moran, Lee Horn, Dave Burns, and John McCloskey.\n\nTaylor was considered the No. 1 prospect in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. He was also rated the nation's No. 1 skill athlete and an All-American by ''[[Super Prep]]''. Taylor was also an ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' Super Southern Team selection, the No. 1 athlete on the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' Super 75 list and rated the No. 1 player in Florida by ''[[The Gainesville Sun]]''.\n\nIn 2007, he was also named to the [[FHSAA's All-Century Team|Florida High School Association All-Century Team]], which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state.

He was also a member of the Hurricanes [[track & field]] team, competing in events such as the 100-meter and 200-meters.\n\n===2001 season===\nAs a freshman (one of four true freshmen to play for the team), Taylor carved a niche for himself in Miami's secondary in nickel and dime defensive schemes. During the season, Taylor was named Big East [[Big East Conference football awards|Special Teams Player of the Week]] for his performance against the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]].<ref name=heraldupdate1 /> The Hurricanes won the national championship in 2001.\n\n===2002 season===\nIn 2002, his first season as a starter, Taylor was a second-team All-Big East selection by the league's head coaches. He finished third on the team in tackles with 85 (53 solo), broke up 15 passes, intercepted 4 passes, forced one fumble, blocked one kick and returned a punt for a touchdown. He led all Miami defensive backs in tackles, interceptions and passes broken up, and had a career-high 11 tackles (2 solo) and intercepted 2 passes in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] loss to [[Ohio State University football|Ohio State]]. He made a critical play during the game, in which he intercepted Buckeyes quarterback [[Craig Krenzel]] in the endzone and returned the ball out of the endzone. Buckeyes running back [[Maurice Clarett]] ran Taylor down, and in the process stripped the ball away from him. Clarett recovered the ball for Ohio State, allowing them to kick a field goal to go up 17\u20137 at the time.\n\n===2003 season===\nTaylor produced a historic season during his final year at Miami that culminated with a plethora of honors and awards. He was named a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big East Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the [[Jim Thorpe Award]], given to the nation's best defensive back. He led the Big East Conference and ranked first nationally in interceptions with 10, tying the record for interceptions in a season with former Hurricanes standout [[Bennie Blades]]. Taylor also finished first in total tackles with 77 (57 solo). He intercepted two passes in Miami's impressive 28\u201314 win over [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], playing a key role as the Hurricanes limited All-American receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]] to just three receptions for 26 yards. He returned interceptions for an average of 18.4 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown return at [[Boston College football|Boston College]], a 50-yard scoring runback at [[Florida State University football|Florida State]] and a 44-yard scoring runback against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]]. His three touchdown returns of interceptions is a Miami single-season record.\n\nTaylor also competed in [[track & field]] as a senior for the Hurricanes.

He was a founder of the [[The Society of Legal Scholars|Society of Public Teachers of Law]] and its secretary 1909-1917.\n\nHe married first in 1890 to Annie Ingham, who died after giving birth to a son; the son would die fighting in the Great War. His second marriage in 1898 was to Dorothy Maud, a daughter of Sir [[William Bower Forwood]], with whom he had a daughter, and a son [[Jorian Jenks]].\n\nJenks wrote a number of books and essays dealing with law, politics and history. He was the principal editor of ''A Digest of English Civil Law'' (1905\u20131917) which led to receipt of an honorary doctorate from Paris. After two further editions in his lifetime (1921 and 1938), the fourth edition (1947), edited in his place by [[Percy Henry Winfield|P. H. Winfield]], retained Jenks's ''Prolegomena'', with its opening remark that a digest uses the [[indicative mood]] rather than the [[imperative mood]] of a code, and differs from an encyclopaedia in that it aims at economy of words. In the preface to the first instalment of the 1905 -17 edition, Jenks mentioned that the work had resulted from a suggestion of the President of the Berlin Society for Comparative Jurisprudence and Political Economy for a statement of English law, intended by the Society as the first of its projected series of handbooks on the legal systems of modern civilized communities, it being the Society's intention to produce a series of works to be modelled after the pattern of the [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] which came into force throughout the German Empire on 1 January 1900, but departing from the arrangement of the German Code as considered advisable.<ref>''A digest of English civil law, by Edward Jenks, (editor) W.

He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the bar]] in 1887.\n\nHe held many seats: Director of Studies in Law and History at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] 1888-9, Dean at the faculty of law [[University of Melbourne]] 1890, [[University College, Liverpool]] 1890-92 then later to 1895 at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], reader of English at [[University of Oxford]] from 1896, and then at the [[University of London]] from 1928-1930  as a professor of English law in the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], being succeeded by [[David Hughes Parry|Sir David Hughes Parry]].\n\nJenks was a [[Fellow of the British Academy]]. He was a founder of the [[The Society of Legal Scholars|Society of Public Teachers of Law]] and its secretary 1909-1917.\n\nHe married first in 1890 to Annie Ingham, who died after giving birth to a son; the son would die fighting in the Great War. His second marriage in 1898 was to Dorothy Maud, a daughter of Sir [[William Bower Forwood]], with whom he had a daughter, and a son [[Jorian Jenks]].\n\nJenks wrote a number of books and essays dealing with law, politics and history. He was the principal editor of ''A Digest of English Civil Law'' (1905\u20131917) which led to receipt of an honorary doctorate from Paris. After two further editions in his lifetime (1921 and 1938), the fourth edition (1947), edited in his place by [[Percy Henry Winfield|P. H. Winfield]], retained Jenks's ''Prolegomena'', with its opening remark that a digest uses the [[indicative mood]] rather than the [[imperative mood]] of a code, and differs from an encyclopaedia in that it aims at economy of words. In the preface to the first instalment of the 1905 -17 edition, Jenks mentioned that the work had resulted from a suggestion of the President of the Berlin Society for Comparative Jurisprudence and Political Economy for a statement of English law, intended by the Society as the first of its projected series of handbooks on the legal systems of modern civilized communities, it being the Society's intention to produce a series of works to be modelled after the pattern of the [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] which came into force throughout the German Empire on 1 January 1900, but departing from the arrangement of the German Code as considered advisable.<ref>''A digest of English civil law, by Edward Jenks, (editor) W.

He acquired his DJ name from the condiment [[Mustard (condiment)|dijon mustard]] because his first name is also Dijon. He began DJing more as he got older, and became much more skilled at the craft which led to him DJing at the local clubs.\n\n==Musical career==\n[[File:DJ Mustard Concert With Lasers.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|A DJ Mustard concert]]\nIn an interview with Sway's Universe, DJ Mustard described his business relationship with West coast rapper [[YG (rapper)|YG]]. Since YG's second [[mixtape]] ''[[The Real 4Fingaz]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=YG - The Real 4Fingaz|url=http://www.datpiff.com/YG-The-Real-4Fingaz-mixtape.118174.html|publisher=datpiff}}</ref> he has produced on all of his mixtapes. \"I started making beats for YG; he was one the first people to do my beats. I started with him, so for us to do a mixtape was easy. We created this dancing sound. I feel like we owed it to the streets and we're not stopping.\"<ref name=\"swaysuniverse1\"/> DJ Mustard has produced singles by YG such as \"Bitches Ain't Shit\" featuring rappers [[Tyga]] and [[Nipsey Hussle]], and \"You Broke\" also featuring Nipsey Hussle. During 2010, DJ Mustard released an unofficial compilation album with various artists through the label [[Thump Records]] that was called ''Let's Jerk'' named after the street dance called [[Jerkin'|jerking]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lets Jerk album|url=https://www.amazon.com/DJ-Mustard-Presents-Lets-Jerk/dp/B003SS5M86|publisher=Amazon}}</ref>\n\nDuring late 2011, DJ Mustard produced Tyga's third single \"[[Rack City]]\" from his second album ''[[Careless World: Rise of the Last King]]''. The song was released in December 2011, and peaked at #7 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'' chart, #1 on the ''[[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]'' chart, and #2 on the ''[[Hot Rap Songs]]'' chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tyga - Chart History|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=tyga|chart=Hot 100}}|publisher=Billboard}}</ref> It was also certified 2x platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum - Tyga|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Tyga&format=&go=Search&perPage=50|publisher=RIAA}}</ref> According to Mustard, the beat for the song was originally for [[YG (rapper)|YG]]. YG told Mustard that Tyga needed a beat, so he sent the beat to Tyga.<ref name=\"swaysuniverse1\"/> DJ Mustard's career was given a huge blast from the song. He also produced two tracks from Tyga's mixtape ''[[Well Done 3]]'', the third installment of his ''Well Done'' series and his song \"Hit Em Up\" featuring rapper [[Jadakiss]] from his third album ''[[Hotel California (Tyga album)|Hotel California]]'', released on April 9, 2013.\n\nDuring 2012, DJ Mustard produced [[Atlanta]] rapper [[2 Chainz]]'s song \"[[I'm Different (2 Chainz song)|I'm Different]]\" that was released as the third single from his major debut album ''[[Based on a T.R.U.
