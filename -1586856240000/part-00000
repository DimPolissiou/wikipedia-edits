The song features guest vocals from his long-time partner, American singer-songwriter [[Gwen Stefani]]. It was produced by [[Scott Hendricks]] and written by [[Ross Copperman]], [[Shane McAnally]], [[Josh Osborne]], and [[Tommy Lee James]]. Following \"[[Go Ahead and Break My Heart]]\" (2016) and \"[[You Make It Feel Like Christmas (song)|You Make It Feel Like Christmas]]\" (2017), \"Nobody but You\" marks Shelton and Stefani's third collaboration. The song was first revealed in October 2019, although Stefani's contributions remained a secret until a week prior to the song's release. It was sent to American country music radio outlets on January 21, 2020, becoming the third single from the compilation.\n\nMusic reviewers gave positive feedback to the song, calling it romantic and heartfelt. Particular praise was aimed at Shelton and Stefani's chemistry. In the United States, the song peaked at number 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It reached the top spot on the [[Digital Songs]] chart, becoming the second and third number one entry for Shelton and Stefani, respectively. The song also charted in Canada and on the digital component chart in Australia. \"Nobody but You\" has sold approximately 142,000 copies in the United States as of March 2020.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Sophie Muller]], her second joint collaboration with Shelton and Stefani. It serves as a glimpse of the couple's day-to-day life, featuring scenes of them cuddling, eating food at a diner, and visiting the construction site of Shelton's [[Oklahoma]] ranch. An acoustic version of the song was released in March 2020, along with a live video filmed by Shelton and Stefani. The pair performed \"Nobody but You\" at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] on January 26, 2020.\n\n== Background and release ==\n[[File:Shane.Headshot.2019.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Stefani first learned about \"Nobody but You\" after working with [[Shane McAnally]] (''shown''), who suggested that Shelton record it.|alt=A black-and-white photograph of singer and songwriter Shane McAnally posing in front of the camera.]]\nOn October 23, 2019, [[Blake Shelton]] announced the details and revealed the cover art for his third [[compilation album]], ''[[Fully Loaded: God's Country]]'' (2019).

[[Sindelfingen]] and B\u00f6blingen are [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nB\u00f6blingen was founded by [[Count Wilhelm von T\u00fcbingen-B\u00f6blingen]] in 1253. [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] acquired the town in 1357, and on 12 May 1525 one of the bloodiest battles of the [[German Peasants' War]] took place in B\u00f6blingen. [[J\u00f6rg Truchsess von Waldburg]] attacked a force of 15,000 armed peasants; 3,000 were killed. By the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648, the population of B\u00f6blingen had been reduced to 600.\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]], B\u00f6blingen became the seat of an ''Oberamt'' (administrative unit) in 1818. The town was connected to the railroad network in 1879, allowing [[industrialization]] to take place. In the context of administrative reform in 1938, B\u00f6blingen ''Oberamt'' became B\u00f6blingen ''Landkreis'' (district).\n\n[[File:B\u00f6blingen 01 1939-07-01.jpg|thumb|left|B\u00f6blingen before Second World War]]\n\nDuring World War I, an airbase was established. It went into service on 16 August 1915. It had a significant impact on the further development of the city. In 1925 the airbase became the Landesflughafen ([[States of Germany|state]] airport) of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] called [[B\u00f6blingen Airport]]. The aircraft pioneer [[Klemm|Hanns Klemm]] (1885\u20131961) established his company \"Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau GmbH\" (\"Klemm Light Aircraft Company\") next to it. Until the [[World War II|Second World War]] it was the major employer in B\u00f6blingen.\n\nDuring World War II, the town had a Luftwaffe airbase and military barracks. On 1 September 1939 (the day the war began) the airbase was the home station for the I/JG 52 (1st Group of the Jagdgeschwader 52) flying the Bf109 E-1 fighter aircraft.\n\nOn the night of 7 October 1943 during [[World War II]], Allied air forces dropped 408 incendiary bombs and 35 high explosive bombs, killing 20 men, 12 women, 12 children and wounding 200 people. 1,735 people lost their homes and 70 percent of the old town was destroyed. In July 1944, another attack followed, killing 36 more civilians.\n\n[[File:B\u00f6blingen 04 1943-10-12.jpg|thumb|Town center after Allied bombing of civilian homes on 7 October 1943]]\n\nIn 1962, B\u00f6blingen was designated a ''[[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]]'' (major district town). Its current boundaries were established in 1971 when the it was merged with the municipality of [[Dagersheim]].\n\n==Population history==\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{|\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Number of inhabitants\n|-----\n| 1598 || align=\"right\" | ca. 800\n|-----\n| 1654 || align=\"right\" | 628\n|-----\n| 1803 || align=\"right\" | 2,125\n|-----\n| 1823 || align=\"right\" | 2,549\n|-----\n| 1843 || align=\"right\" | 3,504\n|-----\n| 1861 || align=\"right\" | 3,287\n|-----\n| 1 December 1871 || align=\"right\" | 3,826\n|-----\n| 1 December 1880 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 4,365\n|-----\n| 1 December 1890 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 4,659\n|-----\n| 1 December 1900 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 5,303\n|-----\n| 1 December 1910 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 6,019\n|-----\n| 16 June 1925 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 7,227\n|-----\n| 16 June 1933 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 7,998\n|}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{|\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Number of inhabitants\n|-----\n| 17 May 1939 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 12,560\n|-----\n| 1946 || align=\"right\" | 10,809\n|-----\n| 13 September 1950 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 12,601\n|-----\n| 6 June 1961 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 25,366\n|-----\n| 27 May 1970 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 35,925\n|-----\n| 31 December 1975 || align=\"right\" | 40,547\n|-----\n| 31 December 1980 || align=\"right\" | 41,505\n|-----\n| 27 May 1987 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 42,589\n|-----\n| 31 December 1990 || align=\"right\" | 44,903\n|-----\n| 31 December 1995 || align=\"right\" | 46,516\n|-----\n| 31 December 2000 || align=\"right\" | 45,637\n|-----\n| 30 September 2004 || align=\"right\" | 46,064\n|-----\n| 31 December 2013 || align=\"right\" | 46,714\n|}\n|}\n\n==Transport==\n\nB\u00f6blingen is easily reached by multiple forms of transport.\n\n;Air\n\nB\u00f6blingen is about 20 minutes away from [[Stuttgart Airport]] via S-Bahn.\n\n;Automobile\n\nThe interchange between the federal freeways (''[[Autobahn]]'') [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] and [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] lies northeast from B\u00f6blingen.

[[Sindelfingen]] and B\u00f6blingen are [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nB\u00f6blingen was founded by [[Count Wilhelm von T\u00fcbingen-B\u00f6blingen]] in 1253. [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] acquired the town in 1357, and on 12 May 1525 one of the bloodiest battles of the [[German Peasants' War]] took place in B\u00f6blingen. [[J\u00f6rg Truchsess von Waldburg]] attacked a force of 15,000 armed peasants; 3,000 were killed. By the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648, the population of B\u00f6blingen had been reduced to 600.\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]], B\u00f6blingen became the seat of an ''Oberamt'' (administrative unit) in 1818. The town was connected to the railroad network in 1879, allowing [[industrialization]] to take place. In the context of administrative reform in 1938, B\u00f6blingen ''Oberamt'' became B\u00f6blingen ''Landkreis'' (district).\n\n[[File:B\u00f6blingen 01 1939-07-01.jpg|thumb|left|B\u00f6blingen before Second World War]]\n\nDuring World War I, an airbase was established. It went into service on 16 August 1915. It had a significant impact on the further development of the city. In 1925 the airbase became the Landesflughafen ([[States of Germany|state]] airport) of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] called [[B\u00f6blingen Airport]]. The aircraft pioneer [[Klemm|Hanns Klemm]] (1885\u20131961) established his company \"Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau GmbH\" (\"Klemm Light Aircraft Company\") next to it. Until the [[World War II|Second World War]] it was the major employer in B\u00f6blingen.\n\nDuring World War II, the town had a Luftwaffe airbase and military barracks. On 1 September 1939 (the day the war began) the airbase was the home station for the I/JG 52 (1st Group of the Jagdgeschwader 52) flying the Bf109 E-1 fighter aircraft.\n\nOn the night of 7 October 1943 during [[World War II]], Allied air forces dropped 408 incendiary bombs and 35 high explosive bombs, killing 20 men, 12 women, 12 children and wounding 200 people. 1,735 people lost their homes and 70 percent of the old town was destroyed. In July 1944, another attack followed, killing 36 more civilians.\n\n[[File:B\u00f6blingen 04 1943-10-12.jpg|thumb|Town center after Allied bombing of civilian homes on 7 October 1943]]\n\nIn 1962, B\u00f6blingen was designated a ''[[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]]'' (major district town). Its current boundaries were established in 1971 when the it was merged with the municipality of [[Dagersheim]].\n\n==Population history==\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{|\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Number of inhabitants\n|-----\n| 1598 || align=\"right\" | ca. 800\n|-----\n| 1654 || align=\"right\" | 628\n|-----\n| 1803 || align=\"right\" | 2,125\n|-----\n| 1823 || align=\"right\" | 2,549\n|-----\n| 1843 || align=\"right\" | 3,504\n|-----\n| 1861 || align=\"right\" | 3,287\n|-----\n| 1 December 1871 || align=\"right\" | 3,826\n|-----\n| 1 December 1880 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 4,365\n|-----\n| 1 December 1890 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 4,659\n|-----\n| 1 December 1900 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 5,303\n|-----\n| 1 December 1910 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 6,019\n|-----\n| 16 June 1925 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 7,227\n|-----\n| 16 June 1933 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 7,998\n|}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{|\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Number of inhabitants\n|-----\n| 17 May 1939 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 12,560\n|-----\n| 1946 || align=\"right\" | 10,809\n|-----\n| 13 September 1950 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 12,601\n|-----\n| 6 June 1961 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 25,366\n|-----\n| 27 May 1970 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 35,925\n|-----\n| 31 December 1975 || align=\"right\" | 40,547\n|-----\n| 31 December 1980 || align=\"right\" | 41,505\n|-----\n| 27 May 1987 \u00b9 || align=\"right\" | 42,589\n|-----\n| 31 December 1990 || align=\"right\" | 44,903\n|-----\n| 31 December 1995 || align=\"right\" | 46,516\n|-----\n| 31 December 2000 || align=\"right\" | 45,637\n|-----\n| 30 September 2004 || align=\"right\" | 46,064\n|-----\n| 31 December 2013 || align=\"right\" | 46,714\n|}\n|}\n\n==Transport==\n\nB\u00f6blingen is easily reached by multiple forms of transport.\n\n;Air\n\nB\u00f6blingen is about 20 minutes away from [[Stuttgart Airport]] via S-Bahn.\n\n;Automobile\n\nThe interchange between the federal freeways (''[[Autobahn]]'') [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] and [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] lies northeast from B\u00f6blingen.

The manga was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' from May 1996 to June 2000, and published in 12 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]] from November 1996 to July 2000. The story focuses on [[Sakura Kinomoto]], an elementary school student in Japan who discovers magical powers after accidentally freeing a set of magical cards into the world; she must retrieve the cards to prevent catastrophe. Each of these cards grants different magical powers, and can only be activated by someone with inherent magical abilities. A sequel by Clamp, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]],'' focusing on Sakura in junior high school, began serialization in ''Nakayoshi'' in 2016.\n\nThe series was adapted into a 70-episode [[anime]] television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] that aired on Japan's [[satellite television]] channel [[NHK|NHK BS2]] from April 1998 to March 2000. Additional media include anime films, [[video game]]s, [[art book]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[film comic]]s. [[Tokyopop]] released the manga in English in North America from March 2000 to August 2003. After Tokyopop's license expired, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Manga]] released the series in omnibus editions from October 2010 to September 2012.</onlyinclude>\n\n[[Nelvana]] licensed the TV series and first film for North America under the English title '''''Cardcaptors''''', which first aired on [[Kids' WB]] from June 2000 to December 2001. All 70 episodes were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]]; while other English-speaking territories received the full run, the version aired on American television was heavily edited into 39 episodes. ''Cardcaptors'' also aired on [[Cartoon Network]], [[Teletoon]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]. The TV series and films were sub-licensed by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]], which released them unedited with English subtitles.  The TV series was also released by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was critically well-received. Critics praised the manga for its creativity and described it as a quintessential ''sh\u014djo'' manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga in 2001. The television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers, and for its artwork, humor, and animation; it won the [[Animage|Animage Grand Prix]] award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of ''Cardcaptors'', however, was criticized for removing elements essential to the plot.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura characters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near [[Tokyo]]. Ten-year-old [[Sakura Kinomoto]] accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book, explains only a person with magical powers could open the seal of the book, and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with both battle costumes and morale support. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.\n\nSyaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.\n\nAfterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.\n\nThe plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fianc\u00e9e Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a jealous and romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the ''Clear Card'' anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-26/new-cardcaptor-sakura-manga-is-sequel-launching-in-june/.101473 |title=New Cardcaptor Sakura Manga Is Sequel Launching in June |date=April 26, 2016 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was first conceived shortly before the conclusion of Clamp's ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', which was serialized in ''[[Nakayoshi]]''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in ''Nakayoshi'', and Clamp decided to make a \"''Nakayoshi''-esque\" series, as opposed to ''Rayearth'', which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer [[Ageha Ohkawa|Nanase Ohkawa]]'s first impulse was to create a [[magical girl]] series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura to be in the same age group as the majority of ''Nakayoshi''{{'}}s readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp\u2014[[Mokona]], [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] and [[Satsuki Igarashi]]\u2014design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nVarious other titles were suggested for the series such as ''Cardcaster Sakura'' and ''Card Character Sakura'' before Nekoi suggested ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> While Ohkawa planned out ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so it would look like she was in love with Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of \"if you try your best, it'll work out\", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's \"It'll definitely be okay\" mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that \"minorities would feel comfortable with,\" referring to the [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex]] and [[taboo]] relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nThe central theme of ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is [[love]] and human relationships. Throughout the series, many forms of love are showcased, including \"sibling love, childhood crushes, unrequited love, [and] true love.\"<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" /> At times, Clamp even ignores the Clow Cards for several chapters to focus more on the relationships of Sakura and those around her. Each of these relationships are presented as is, with Clamp carefully avoiding passing judgment on the correctness of the relationships. In particular, the romantic relationship between elementary student [[Rika Sasaki]] and her teacher [[Yoshiyuki Terada]] is presented in such a way that it can be seen as a sweet and innocent tale of \"wish fulfillment\", or if examined more seriously, as a mildly disturbing story of [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] love.<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" />\n\nThe artists, especially Mokona, were told by Ohkawa to use thin lines and to try to express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a \"soft, cute-like\" feel, so she asked the artists to not use a lot of ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter. Igarashi remarked that they \"never had to draw so many flowers for one series,\" but they made a point to not use roses.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> Clamp wanted to incorporate transformation scenes into ''Cardcaptor Sakura'', but because many magical girl manga have the girls wearing the same outfit, they wanted Sakura to wear different costumes. They felt that \"it's pretty sad for a girl to wear the same outfit all the time.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Solomon, Charles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/arts/design/28clam.html?_r=1|title=Four Mothers of Manga Gain American Fans With Expertise in a Variety of Visual Styles|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2006|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura chapters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by the manga artist group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].

The manga was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' from May 1996 to June 2000, and published in 12 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]] from November 1996 to July 2000. The story focuses on [[Sakura Kinomoto]], an elementary school student in Japan who discovers magical powers after accidentally freeing a set of magical cards into the world; she must retrieve the cards to prevent catastrophe. Each of these cards grants different magical powers, and can only be activated by someone with inherent magical abilities. A sequel by Clamp, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]],'' focusing on Sakura in junior high school, began serialization in ''Nakayoshi'' in 2016.\n\nThe series was adapted into a 70-episode [[anime]] television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] that aired on Japan's [[satellite television]] channel [[NHK|NHK BS2]] from April 1998 to March 2000. Additional media include anime films, [[video game]]s, [[art book]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[film comic]]s. [[Tokyopop]] released the manga in English in North America from March 2000 to August 2003. After Tokyopop's license expired, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Manga]] released the series in omnibus editions from October 2010 to September 2012.</onlyinclude>\n\n[[Nelvana]] licensed the TV series and first film for North America under the English title '''''Cardcaptors''''', which first aired on [[Kids' WB]] from June 2000 to December 2001. All 70 episodes were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]]; while other English-speaking territories received the full run, the version aired on American television was heavily edited into 39 episodes. ''Cardcaptors'' also aired on [[Cartoon Network]], [[Teletoon]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]. The TV series and films were sub-licensed by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]], which released them unedited with English subtitles.  The TV series was also released by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was critically well-received. Critics praised the manga for its creativity and described it as a quintessential ''sh\u014djo'' manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga in 2001. The television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers, and for its artwork, humor, and animation; it won the [[Animage|Animage Grand Prix]] award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of ''Cardcaptors'', however, was criticized for removing elements essential to the plot.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura characters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near [[Tokyo]]. Ten-year-old [[Sakura Kinomoto]] accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book, explains only a person with magical powers could open the seal of the book, and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with both battle costumes and morale support. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.\n\nSyaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.\n\nAfterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.\n\nThe plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fianc\u00e9e Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a jealous and romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the ''Clear Card'' anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-26/new-cardcaptor-sakura-manga-is-sequel-launching-in-june/.101473 |title=New Cardcaptor Sakura Manga Is Sequel Launching in June |date=April 26, 2016 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was first conceived shortly before the conclusion of Clamp's ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', which was serialized in ''[[Nakayoshi]]''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in ''Nakayoshi'', and Clamp decided to make a \"''Nakayoshi''-esque\" series, as opposed to ''Rayearth'', which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer [[Ageha Ohkawa|Nanase Ohkawa]]'s first impulse was to create a [[magical girl]] series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura to be in the same age group as the majority of ''Nakayoshi''{{'}}s readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp\u2014[[Mokona]], [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] and [[Satsuki Igarashi]]\u2014design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nVarious other titles were suggested for the series such as ''Cardcaster Sakura'' and ''Card Character Sakura'' before Nekoi suggested ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> While Ohkawa planned out ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so it would look like she was in love with Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of \"if you try your best, it'll work out\", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's \"It'll definitely be okay\" mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that \"minorities would feel comfortable with,\" referring to the [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex]] and [[taboo]] relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nThe central theme of ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is [[love]] and human relationships. Throughout the series, many forms of love are showcased, including \"sibling love, childhood crushes, unrequited love, [and] true love.\"<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" /> At times, Clamp even ignores the Clow Cards for several chapters to focus more on the relationships of Sakura and those around her. Each of these relationships are presented as is, with Clamp carefully avoiding passing judgment on the correctness of the relationships. In particular, the romantic relationship between elementary student [[Rika Sasaki]] and her teacher [[Yoshiyuki Terada]] is presented in such a way that it can be seen as a sweet and innocent tale of \"wish fulfillment\", or if examined more seriously, as a mildly disturbing story of [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] love.<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" />\n\nThe artists, especially Mokona, were told by Ohkawa to use thin lines and to try to express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a \"soft, cute-like\" feel, so she asked the artists to not use a lot of ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter. Igarashi remarked that they \"never had to draw so many flowers for one series,\" but they made a point to not use roses.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> Clamp wanted to incorporate transformation scenes into ''Cardcaptor Sakura'', but because many magical girl manga have the girls wearing the same outfit, they wanted Sakura to wear different costumes. They felt that \"it's pretty sad for a girl to wear the same outfit all the time.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Solomon, Charles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/arts/design/28clam.html?_r=1|title=Four Mothers of Manga Gain American Fans With Expertise in a Variety of Visual Styles|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2006|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura chapters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by the manga artist group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].
