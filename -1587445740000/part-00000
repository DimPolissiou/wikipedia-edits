He is the former vocalist and founder of the American [[post-hardcore]] band [[Underoath]]. He performed on three Underoath albums: ''[[Act of Depression]]'', ''[[Cries of the Past]]'', and ''[[The Changing of Times]]''.

I feel like so much of music today, especially those who come from a [[Christianity|Christian]] background, spend so much time hiding who they really are, or being ashamed of their beliefs, trying to be 'scene' or to sell records.

The species ''[[Vertigo hubrichti]]'' and ''Vertigo morsei'' are endemic to the upper Midwest. These two species had the highest occurrence frequencies along the Door and Garden Peninsulas. Door County is also home to several uncommon species from the genus ''[[Oxychilus]]'', which is non-native and introduced from Europe. One was found near a vacation home and may have been introduced by landscape plantings. Within the county, Brussels Hill, North Kangaroo Lake, Rock Island and the escarpment with its cool [[algific talus slope|algific]] habitat supports populations of rare snails.<ref>[http://biology.unm.edu/jnekola/nekola%20pdf/amb-18-21-44.pdf Terrestrial gastropod fauna of Northeastern Wisconsin and the Southern Upper Peninsula of Michigan], Jeffrey C.

This was the result of an experiment to stock millions of eggs from the species ''[[Hexagenia limbata]]'' and ''[[Hexagenia bilineata]]'' in the lower Green Bay area in an attempt to reintroduce the species. The last mayfly from the genus ''[[Hexagenia]]'' had been collected in the lower Green Bay area in 1955. As mayfly populations can be unstable and not all stocking locations appeared to be successful, as of 2017 it was not yet known whether it would be possible for populations of ''Hexagenia'' mayflies to become self-sustaining.<ref>[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d03bfb936126b000179a66b/t/5d080c80e259a50001faf6b6/1560808598739/Kaster+et+al+2018+Green+Bay.pdf Evaluation of lower Green Bay benthic fauna with emphasis on re-ecesis of Hexagenia mayfly nymphs] by Jerry L.

By 1895, a large fruit tree nursery was established and fruit horticulture was aggressively promoted. Not only farmers but even \"city-bred\" men were urged to consider fruit husbandry as a career. The first of multiple fruit marketing cooperatives began in 1897. In addition to corporate-run orchards, in 1910 the first corporation was established to plant and sell pre-established orchards. Although apple orchards predated cherry orchards, by 1913 it was reported that cherries had outpaced apples.<ref name=Cain>{{cite thesis |last=Cain |first=Cortney |date=May 2006 |title=The Development of Apple Horticulture in Wisconsin, 1850s-1950s: Case Studies of Bayfield, Crawford, and Door Counties |type=M.A. thesis |chapter=Chapter 4, Door County Apple Horticulture |publisher=UW-Madison |chapter-url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005752947 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Cherry crop labor sources====\nWomen and children were typically employed to pick fruit crops, but the available work outstripped the labor supply. By 1918, it was difficult to find enough help to pick fruit crops, so workers were brought in by the YMCA and Boy Scouts of America. Cherry picking was marketed as a good summer camp activity for teenage boys in return for room, board, and recreation activities. One orchard hired players from the [[Green Bay Packers]] as camp counselors. Additionally, members of the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and other native tribes were employed to pick fruit crops.<ref>[https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/68290/Bankston%20Jarocki%20Miller.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Geography of Apple Orchards in Wisconsin: Examining the Core of Cultivation] by Kody Bankston, Morgan Jarocki, and Adrienne Miller, unpublished student paper, UW-Madison, 2012</ref><ref>[https://wi101.wisc.edu/2017/07/01/migrant-labor-and-door-county-cherries/ Migrant Labor and Door County Cherries] by Emily Irwin, July 1, 2017</ref> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp was established at [[Peninsula State Park]] during the [[Great Depression]].

The newest is in a relatively shallow layer of sand and gravel, but tends to not to provide enough water except in the southeastern part of the county. Further down are layers of dolomite bedrock that are recharged by water percolating from the layer of sand and gravel. Past the dolomite is a layer of shale that [[aquitard|does not contain water]], although potentially it is a source of oil. Past the shale is a layer of sandstone that is also host to a bedrock aquifer.

[[Deroceras|Slugs]] were found in all three counties. Peninsula State Park is home to the northernmost known population of ''Strobilops aenea''. The species ''[[Vertigo hubrichti]]'' and ''Vertigo morsei'' are endemic to the upper Midwest. These two species had the highest occurrence frequencies along the Door and Garden Peninsulas. Door County is also home to several uncommon species from the genus ''[[Oxychilus]]'', which is non-native and introduced from Europe. One was found near a vacation home and may have been introduced by landscape plantings. Within the county, Brussels Hill, North Kangaroo Lake, Rock Island and the escarpment with its cool [[algific talus slope|algific]] habitat supports populations of rare snails.<ref>[http://biology.unm.edu/jnekola/nekola%20pdf/amb-18-21-44.pdf Terrestrial gastropod fauna of Northeastern Wisconsin and the Southern Upper Peninsula of Michigan], Jeffrey C.

Acidic solutions have a lower pH, while basic solutions have a higher pH. At room temperature (25\u00b0C or 77\u00b0F), [[pure water]] is neither acidic nor basic and has a pH of 7.\n\nThe pH scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and inversely indicates the [[concentration]] of [[hydrogen ion]]s in the solution (a lower pH indicates a higher concentration of hydrogen ions). This is because the formula used to calculate pH approximates the [[Negative number|negative]] of the [[base 10 logarithm]] of the [[molar concentration]]{{efn|Measured in units of [[mole (unit)|moles]] per litre.}} of hydrogen ions in the solution. More precisely, pH is the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of the hydrogen ion.<ref name=\"Bates\">Bates, Roger G.

For a commonplace example based on the facts that the masses of a mole of water, a mole of hydrogen ions, and a mole of [[hydroxide ion]]s are respectively 18 g, 1 g, and 17 g, a quantity of 10<sup>7</sup> moles of pure (pH 7) water, or 180 tonnes (18&times;10<sup>7</sup> g), contains close to 1 g of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] hydrogen ions (or rather 19 g of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> [[hydronium]] ions) and 17 g of hydroxide ions.\n\nNote that pH depends on temperature. For instance at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C the pH of pure water is 7.47. At 25&nbsp;\u00b0C it's 7.00, and at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C it's 6.14.\n\nThis definition was adopted because [[ion-selective electrode]]s, which are used to measure pH, respond to activity. Ideally, electrode potential, ''E'', follows the [[Nernst equation]], which, for the hydrogen ion can be written as\n\n:<math chem> E = E^0 + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(a_\\ce{H+})=E^0 - \\frac{2.303 RT}{F} \\ce{pH}</math>\n\nwhere ''E'' is a measured potential, ''E''<sup>0</sup> is the standard electrode potential, ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s, ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]]. For H<sup>+</sup> number of electrons transferred is one. It follows that electrode potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity.  Precise measurement of pH is presented in International Standard [[ISO 31-8]] as follows:<ref>Quantities and units \u2013 Part 8: Physical chemistry and molecular physics, Annex C (normative): pH. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 1992.</ref> A [[galvanic cell]] is set up to measure the [[electromotive force]] (e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution. The reference electrode may be a [[silver chloride electrode]] or a [[Saturated calomel electrode|calomel electrode]]. The hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a [[standard hydrogen electrode]].\n\n:<span class=\"texhtml\">Reference electrode | concentrated solution of KCl || test solution | H<sub>2</sub> | Pt</span>{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\nFirstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the emf, ''E''<sub>S</sub>, is measured. Then the emf, ''E''<sub>X</sub>, of the same cell containing the solution of unknown pH is measured.\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{pH(X)} = \\ce{pH(S)}+\\frac{E_\\ce{S} - E_\\ce{X} }{z}</math>\n\nThe difference between the two measured emf values is proportional to pH. This method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential. The proportionality constant, 1/''z'' is ideally equal to <math>\\frac{1}{2.303RT/F}\\ </math> the \"Nernstian slope\".\n\nTo apply this process in practice, a [[glass electrode]] is used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode. It is calibrated against [[buffer solution]]s of known hydrogen ion activity. [[IUPAC]] has proposed the use of a set of buffer solutions of known H<sup>+</sup> activity.<ref name=covington/> Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the \"slope\" may differ slightly from ideal. To implement this approach to calibration, the electrode is first immersed in a standard solution and the reading on a [[pH meter]] is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer's value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted, using the \"slope\" control, to be equal to the pH for that solution. Further details, are given in the [[IUPAC]] recommendations.<ref name=covington/> When more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values. Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures.\n\nThe pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a [[dimensionless quantity]].\n\n===p[H]===\nThis was the original definition of S\u00f8rensen in 1909,<ref name=\"Sor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/heritage/Research/Pages/pHValue.aspx|title=Carlsberg Group Company History Page|publisher=Carlsberggroup.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118043012/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/heritage/Research/Pages/pHValue.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which was superseded in favor of pH in 1924. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted [H<sup>+</sup>] in modern chemistry, which appears to have units of concentration. More correctly, the thermodynamic activity of H<sup>+</sup> in dilute solution should be replaced by [H<sup>+</sup>]/c<sub>0</sub>, where the standard state concentration c<sub>0</sub> = 1&nbsp;mol/L. This ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined.\n\nHowever, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly, if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way to do this, which has been used extensively, is to [[titration|titrate]] a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkaline in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkaline are known, it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a [[Gran plot#Electrode calibration|Gran plot]].<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/ed042p375| last=Rossotti| first=F.J.C.|author2=Rossotti, H.|year=1965|title=Potentiometric titrations solution containing the background electrolyte.</ref> Thus, the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration.\n\nThe glass electrode (and other [[ion selective electrode]]s) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below.\n\nThe difference between p[H] and pH is quite small. It has been stated<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}}, Section 13.23, \"Determination of pH\"</ref> that pH = p[H] + 0.04. It is common practice to use the term \"pH\" for both types of measurement.\n\n===pH indicators===\n{{main|Universal indicator}}\n[[Image:Universal indicator paper.jpg|thumb|Chart showing the variation of color of universal indicator paper with pH]]\nIndicators may be used to measure pH, by making use of the fact that their color changes with pH. Visual comparison of the color of a test solution with a standard color chart provides a means to measure pH accurate to the nearest whole number. More precise measurements are possible if the color is measured spectrophotometrically, using a [[Colorimeter (chemistry)|colorimeter]] or [[spectrophotometer]].\n[[Universal indicator]] consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator. Another method of measuring pH is using an electronic [[pH meter]].\n\n===pOH===\n[[Image:PHscalenolang.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Relation between p[OH] and p[H] (red = acidic region, blue = basic region)]]\npOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions. OH<sup>\u2212</sup>. pOH values are derived from pH measurements. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by\n\n:<math chem>[\\ce{OH^-}] = \\frac{K_\\ce{W}}{[\\ce{H^+}]}</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sub>W</sub> is the [[self-ionization of water|self-ionisation]] constant of water. Taking [[logarithm]]s\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{pOH} = \\ce{p}K_\\ce{W} - \\ce{pH}</math>\n\nSo, at room temperature, pOH \u2248 14 \u2212 pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of [[Alkaline soils|soil alkalinity]].\n\n===Extremes of pH===\nMeasurement of pH below about 2.5 (ca. 0.003&nbsp;[[mole (unit)|mol]] dm<sup>\u22123</sup> acid) and above about 10.5 (ca. 0.0003&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup> alkaline) requires special procedures because, when using the glass electrode, the [[Nernst equation|Nernst law]] breaks down under those conditions. Various factors contribute to this. It cannot be assumed that [[liquid junction potential]]s are independent of pH.<ref name=Feldman>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ac60120a014|title=Use and Abuse of pH measurements|journal=Analytical Chemistry|author=Feldman, Isaac |volume=28|pages=1859\u20131866|year=1956|issue=12}}</ref> Also, extreme pH implies that the solution is concentrated, so electrode potentials are affected by [[ionic strength]] variation. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by \"alkaline error\", because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in the solution.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}}, Section 13.19 The glass electrode</ref> Specially constructed electrodes are available which partly overcome these problems.\n\nRunoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some very low pH values.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nordstrom |first1=D.

Hydrogen ion activity, ''a<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub>'', can be defined<ref name=\"GoldBook\">{{GoldBookRef|title=activity (relative activity), ''a''|file=A00115}}</ref><ref name=\"GreenBook\">{{GreenBookRef2nd|pages=49\u201350}}</ref> as:\n:<math chem>a_\\ce{H+} = \\exp\\left (\\frac{\\mu_\\ce{H+} - \\mu^{\\ominus}_\\ce{H+}}{RT}\\right )</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub> is the [[chemical potential]] of the hydrogen ion, <math chem>\\mu^{\\ominus}_\\ce{H+}</math> is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state, ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature]]. Therefore, pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly due to different solvated proton ions such as lyonium ions, requiring an intersolvent scale which involves the transfer activity coefficient of [[lyonium ion|hydronium/lyonium ion]].\n\npH is an example of an [[acidity function]]. Other acidity functions can be defined. For example, the [[Hammett acidity function]], ''H''<sub>0</sub>, has been developed in connection with [[superacid]]s.\n\n===Unified absolute pH scale===\nThe concept of \"unified pH scale\" has been developed on the basis of the absolute chemical potential of the proton.

When an [[acid]] is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7 (25&nbsp;\u00b0C). When a [[base (chemistry)|base]], or [[alkali]], is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as [[hydrochloric acid]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup> has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as [[sodium hydroxide]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration.\n\nThe pH of neutrality is not exactly 7 (25&nbsp;\u00b0C), although this is a good approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] (or the activities are equal). Since [[self-ionization of water]] holds the product of these concentration [H<sup>+</sup>]&times;[OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] = K<sub>w</sub>, it can be seen that at neutrality [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] = {{radic|K<sub>w</sub>}}, or pH = pK<sub>w</sub>/2. pK<sub>w</sub> is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] in pure water are both neutral, since [[Self-ionization of water|dissociation of water]] produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on [[ionic strength]], so K<sub>w</sub> varies with ionic strength.\n\nIf pure water is exposed to air it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from the air, which is then slowly converted into [[bicarbonate]] and hydrogen ions (essentially creating [[carbonic acid]]).\n:<chem>CO2 + H2O <=> HCO3^- + H+</chem>\n\n===pH in soil===\n\n====Classification of soil pH ranges====\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]], formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows:\n<ref>{{cite web|author=Soil Survey Division Staff|url=http://soils.usda.gov/technical/manual/contents/chapter3.html |title=Soil survey manual.1993.

These solutions have a relatively low [[ionic strength]] (\u22480.1) compared to that of seawater (\u22480.7), and, as a consequence, are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic strength differences cause changes in [[standard electrode potential|electrode potential]]. To resolve this problem, an alternative series of buffers based on [[artificial seawater]] was developed.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0011-7471(73)90101-0|author=Hansson, I.|year=1973|title=A new set of pH-scales and standard buffers for seawater|journal=Deep-Sea Research|volume=20|pages=479\u2013491|issue=5|bibcode=1973DSROA..20..479H}}</ref> This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred to as the 'total scale', often denoted as pH<sub>T</sub>. The total scale was defined using a medium containing [[sulfate]] ions. These ions experience protonation, H<sup>+</sup> + SO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}} {{eqm}} HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}, such that the total scale includes the effect of both [[proton]]s (free hydrogen ions) and hydrogen sulfate ions:\n\n:[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>T</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}]\n\nAn alternative scale, the 'free scale', often denoted 'pH<sub>F</sub>', omits this consideration and focuses solely on [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub>, in principle making it a simpler representation of hydrogen ion concentration.

Resulting in the following expression for [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub>:\n\n:[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}] + [HF]\n\nHowever, the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium. In seawater, for instance, sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (>400 times) than those of fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small.\n\nThe following three equations summarise the three scales of pH:\n\n:pH<sub>F</sub> = \u2212 log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub>\n:pH<sub>T</sub> = \u2212 log ( [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}] ) = \u2212 log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>T</sub>\n:pH<sub>SWS</sub> = \u2212 log ( [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}] + [HF] ) = \u2212 log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub>\n\nIn practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their values by up to 0.12 pH units, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean's [[Total inorganic carbon|carbonate system]].<ref name=zeebe /> Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions, the free scale is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales. Because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion, the total and seawater scales differ only very slightly.\n\n===Living systems===\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+pH in living systems<ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach|last=Boron|first=Walter, F.|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4160-2328-9|author2=Boulpaep, E.L.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The most common disorder in acid-base homeostasis is [[acidosis]], which means an acid overload in the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35. [[Alkalosis]] is the opposite condition, with blood pH being excessively high.\n\nThe pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.365. This value is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. [[Dental plaque|Plaque]] can create a local acidic environment that can result in [[tooth decay]] by demineralization. [[Enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s have an optimum pH range and can become inactivated or [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] outside this range.\n<!-- <div class=\"noprint\">\n[[File:Blood values sorted by mass and molar concentration.png|thumb|900px|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]], showing concentration of protons (purple) at left. It can be seen that the ranges are kept in a narrow range, and that free protons are among the compounds with the very smallest mass concentrations.]]\n</div> -->\n\n==Calculations of pH==\nThe calculation of the pH of a solution containing acids and/or bases is an example of a chemical speciation calculation, that is, a mathematical procedure for calculating the concentrations of all chemical species that are present in the solution. The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution. For strong acids and bases no calculations are necessary except in extreme situations. The pH of a solution containing a weak acid requires the solution of a [[quadratic equation]]. The pH of a solution containing a weak base may require the solution of a [[cubic equation]]. The general case requires the solution of a set of [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s.\n\nA complicating factor is that water itself is a weak acid and a weak base (see [[amphoterism]]). It [[self-ionization of water|dissociates]] according to the equilibrium\n:<chem>2H2O <=> H3O+ (aq) + OH^-(aq)</chem>\nwith a [[acid dissociation constant|dissociation constant]], {{mvar|K<sub>w</sub>}} defined as\n:<math chem>K_w = \\ce{[H+][OH^-]}</math>\nwhere [H<sup>+</sup>] stands for the concentration of the aqueous [[hydronium ion]] and [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] represents the concentration of the [[hydroxide ion]]. This equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is extremely low.\n\n===Strong acids and bases===\n[[Strong acid]]s and [[Strong base|bases]] are compounds that, for practical purposes, are completely dissociated in water. Under normal circumstances this means that the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic solution can be taken to be equal to the concentration of the acid. The pH is then equal to minus the logarithm of the concentration value. [[Hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) is an example of a strong acid. The pH of a 0.01M solution of HCl is equal to \u2212log<sub>10</sub>(0.01), that is, pH = 2. [[Sodium hydroxide]], NaOH, is an example of a strong base. The p[OH] value of a 0.01M solution of NaOH is equal to \u2212log<sub>10</sub>(0.01), that is, p[OH] = 2. From the definition of p[OH] above, this means that the pH is equal to about 12. For solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations the self-ionization equilibrium must be taken into account.\n\nSelf-ionization must also be considered when concentrations are extremely low. Consider, for example, a solution of hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 5\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>M.  The simple procedure given above would suggest that it has a pH of 7.3. This is clearly wrong as an acid solution should have a pH of less than 7. Treating the system as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and the [[amphoteric]] substance water, a pH of 6.89 results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=Chris|title=pH calculation of a very small concentration of a strong acid.|url=http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|accessdate=13 March 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708062942/http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Weak acids and bases===\n\nA weak acid  or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism.\n:<math chem>\\begin{cases}\n\\ce{Acid:} & \\ce{HA <=> H+ + A^-}\\\\\n\\ce{Base:} & \\ce{HA+ <=> H+ + A}\n\\end{cases}</math>\nFirst, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac \\ce{[H] [A]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nand its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so, there are three unknown concentrations, [HA], [H<sup>+</sup>] and [A<sup>\u2212</sup>] to determine by calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to apply the law of  [[mass conservation]] in terms of the two \"reagents\" H and A.\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{A} = \\ce{[A]}  +  \\ce{[HA]}</math>\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{H} = \\ce{[H]}  +  \\ce{[HA]}</math>\nC stands for [[analytical concentration]]. In some texts, one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below. Together with the equation defining K<sub>a</sub>, there are now three equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water C<sub>A</sub> = C<sub>H</sub> = C<sub>a</sub>, the concentration of the acid, so [A] = [H]. After some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.\n:<math chem>[\\ce H]^2 + K_a[\\ce H] - K_a C_a = 0</math>\nSolution of this [[quadratic equation]] gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p[H] or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an [[ICE table]] which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional  (strong) acid or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when C<sub>A</sub> \u2260 C<sub>H</sub>.\n\nFor example, what is the pH of a 0.01M solution of [[benzoic acid]], pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.19?\n\n* Step 1: <math>K_a = 10^{-4.19} = 6.46\\times10^{-5}</math>\n* Step 2: Set up the quadratic equation. <math chem>[\\ce{H}]^2 + 6.46\\times 10^{-5}[\\ce{H}] - 6.46\\times 10^{-7} = 0 </math>\n* Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation. <math chem>[\\ce{H+}] = 7.74\\times 10^{-4};\\quad \\mathrm{pH} = 3.11</math>\nFor alkaline solutions an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation for hydrogen. Since addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-ionization equilibrium to be equal to <math chem>\\frac{K_w}\\ce{[H+]}</math>\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{H} = \\frac{[\\ce H] + [\\ce{HA}] -K_w}\\ce{[H]}</math>\nIn this case the resulting equation in [H] is a cubic equation.\n\n===General method===\nSome systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Billo |first1=E.J. |title= EXCEL for Chemists|edition= 3rd |year= 2011|publisher= Wiley-VCH|isbn= 978-0-470-38123-6}}</ref> With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as A<sub>p</sub>B<sub>q</sub>H<sub>r</sub>,the following general method can be used to calculate the pH of a solution.

Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used.\n\nThere are 3 [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s in the three unknowns, [A], [B] and [H]. Because the equations are non-linear, and because concentrations may range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this formalism, is a key element in the [[determination of equilibrium constants]] by potentiometric titration.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alkaline diet]]\n* [[Arterial blood gas]]\n* [[Chemical equilibrium]]\n* [[pCO2]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|PH|lcfirst=yes}}\n*[http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/pdf/c1xacid2.pdf Chem1 Virtual Textbook, Acid-base Equilibria and Calculations]\n*[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa012803a.htm Red Cabbage pH Indicator]\n*[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/food-ph-d_403.html Food and Foodstuff \u2013 pH Values]\n*[http://www.aqion.onl Online pH Calculator for about 100 inorganic Acids, Bases, and Salts]\n*[https://www.wolkersdorfer.info/en/average-ph-value.html Calculation of mean pH] \n\n{{Wastewater}}{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ph}}\n[[Category:Acid\u2013base chemistry]]\n[[Category:Equilibrium chemistry]]\n[[Category:Units of measurement]]\n[[Category:Water quality indicators]]\n[[Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement]]\n[[Category:General chemistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|PH (disambiguation)}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Lowercase title}}\n[[File:216 pH Scale-01.jpg|thumb|right|pH values of some common substances]]\n{{Acids and bases}}\n\nIn [[chemistry]], '''pH''' ({{IPAc-en|p|i\u02d0|\u02c8|e\u026a|t\u0283}}) (abbr. power of hydrogen<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/what-does-ph-stand-for-608888</ref> or potential for hydrogen<ref>http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pH-scale.html</ref>) is a scale used to specify how [[acidic]] or [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (or alkaline) a [[Aqueous solution|water-based solution]] is. Acidic solutions have a lower pH, while basic solutions have a higher pH. At room temperature (25\u00b0C or 77\u00b0F), [[pure water]] is neither acidic nor basic and has a pH of 7.\n\nThe pH scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and inversely indicates the [[concentration]] of [[hydrogen ion]]s in the solution (a lower pH indicates a higher concentration of hydrogen ions). This is because the formula used to calculate pH approximates the [[Negative number|negative]] of the [[base 10 logarithm]] of the [[molar concentration]]{{efn|Measured in units of [[mole (unit)|moles]] per litre.}} of hydrogen ions in the solution. More precisely, pH is the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of the hydrogen ion.<ref name=\"Bates\">Bates, Roger G.

For a commonplace example based on the facts that the masses of a mole of water, a mole of hydrogen ions, and a mole of [[hydroxide ion]]s are respectively 18 g, 1 g, and 17 g, a quantity of 10<sup>7</sup> moles of pure (pH 7) water, or 180 tonnes (18&times;10<sup>7</sup> g), contains close to 1 g of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] hydrogen ions (or rather 19 g of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> [[hydronium]] ions) and 17 g of hydroxide ions.\n\nNote that pH depends on temperature. For instance at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C the pH of pure water is 7.47. At 25&nbsp;\u00b0C it's 7.00, and at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C it's 6.14.\n\nThis definition was adopted because [[ion-selective electrode]]s, which are used to measure pH, respond to activity. Ideally, electrode potential, ''E'', follows the [[Nernst equation]], which, for the hydrogen ion can be written as\n\n:<math chem> E = E^0 + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(a_\\ce{H+})=E^0 - \\frac{2.303 RT}{F} \\ce{pH}</math>\n\nwhere ''E'' is a measured potential, ''E''<sup>0</sup> is the standard electrode potential, ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s, ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]]. For H<sup>+</sup> number of electrons transferred is one. It follows that electrode potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity.

[[International Organization for Standardization]], 1992.</ref> A [[galvanic cell]] is set up to measure the [[electromotive force]] (e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution. The reference electrode may be a [[silver chloride electrode]] or a [[Saturated calomel electrode|calomel electrode]]. The hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a [[standard hydrogen electrode]].\n\n:<span class=\"texhtml\">Reference electrode | concentrated solution of KCl || test solution | H<sub>2</sub> | Pt</span>{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\nFirstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the emf, ''E''<sub>S</sub>, is measured. Then the emf, ''E''<sub>X</sub>, of the same cell containing the solution of unknown pH is measured.\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{pH(X)} = \\ce{pH(S)}+\\frac{E_\\ce{S} - E_\\ce{X} }{z}</math>\n\nThe difference between the two measured emf values is proportional to pH. This method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential. The proportionality constant, 1/''z'' is ideally equal to <math>\\frac{1}{2.303RT/F}\\ </math> the \"Nernstian slope\".\n\nTo apply this process in practice, a [[glass electrode]] is used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode. It is calibrated against [[buffer solution]]s of known hydrogen ion activity. [[IUPAC]] has proposed the use of a set of buffer solutions of known H<sup>+</sup> activity.<ref name=covington/> Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the \"slope\" may differ slightly from ideal. To implement this approach to calibration, the electrode is first immersed in a standard solution and the reading on a [[pH meter]] is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer's value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted, using the \"slope\" control, to be equal to the pH for that solution. Further details, are given in the [[IUPAC]] recommendations.<ref name=covington/> When more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values. Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures.\n\nThe pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a [[dimensionless quantity]].\n\n===p[H]===\nThis was the original definition of S\u00f8rensen in 1909,<ref name=\"Sor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/heritage/Research/Pages/pHValue.aspx|title=Carlsberg Group Company History Page|publisher=Carlsberggroup.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118043012/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/heritage/Research/Pages/pHValue.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which was superseded in favor of pH in 1924. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted [H<sup>+</sup>] in modern chemistry, which appears to have units of concentration. More correctly, the thermodynamic activity of H<sup>+</sup> in dilute solution should be replaced by [H<sup>+</sup>]/c<sub>0</sub>, where the standard state concentration c<sub>0</sub> = 1&nbsp;mol/L. This ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined.\n\nHowever, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly, if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way to do this, which has been used extensively, is to [[titration|titrate]] a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkaline in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkaline are known, it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a [[Gran plot#Electrode calibration|Gran plot]].<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/ed042p375| last=Rossotti| first=F.J.C.|author2=Rossotti, H.|year=1965|title=Potentiometric titrations solution containing the background electrolyte.</ref> Thus, the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration.\n\nThe glass electrode (and other [[ion selective electrode]]s) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below.\n\nThe difference between p[H] and pH is quite small. It has been stated<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}}, Section 13.23, \"Determination of pH\"</ref> that pH = p[H] + 0.04. It is common practice to use the term \"pH\" for both types of measurement.\n\n===pH indicators===\n{{main|Universal indicator}}\n[[Image:Universal indicator paper.jpg|thumb|Chart showing the variation of color of universal indicator paper with pH]]\nIndicators may be used to measure pH, by making use of the fact that their color changes with pH. Visual comparison of the color of a test solution with a standard color chart provides a means to measure pH accurate to the nearest whole number. More precise measurements are possible if the color is measured spectrophotometrically, using a [[Colorimeter (chemistry)|colorimeter]] or [[spectrophotometer]].\n[[Universal indicator]] consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator. Another method of measuring pH is using an electronic [[pH meter]].\n\n===pOH===\n[[Image:PHscalenolang.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Relation between p[OH] and p[H] (red = acidic region, blue = basic region)]]\npOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions. OH<sup>\u2212</sup>. pOH values are derived from pH measurements. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by\n\n:<math chem>[\\ce{OH^-}] = \\frac{K_\\ce{W}}{[\\ce{H^+}]}</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sub>W</sub> is the [[self-ionization of water|self-ionisation]] constant of water. Taking [[logarithm]]s\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{pOH} = \\ce{p}K_\\ce{W} - \\ce{pH}</math>\n\nSo, at room temperature, pOH \u2248 14 \u2212 pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of [[Alkaline soils|soil alkalinity]].\n\n===Extremes of pH===\nMeasurement of pH below about 2.5 (ca. 0.003&nbsp;[[mole (unit)|mol]] dm<sup>\u22123</sup> acid) and above about 10.5 (ca. 0.0003&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup> alkaline) requires special procedures because, when using the glass electrode, the [[Nernst equation|Nernst law]] breaks down under those conditions. Various factors contribute to this. It cannot be assumed that [[liquid junction potential]]s are independent of pH.<ref name=Feldman>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ac60120a014|title=Use and Abuse of pH measurements|journal=Analytical Chemistry|author=Feldman, Isaac |volume=28|pages=1859\u20131866|year=1956|issue=12}}</ref> Also, extreme pH implies that the solution is concentrated, so electrode potentials are affected by [[ionic strength]] variation. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by \"alkaline error\", because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in the solution.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}}, Section 13.19 The glass electrode</ref> Specially constructed electrodes are available which partly overcome these problems.\n\nRunoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some very low pH values.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nordstrom |first1=D.

Hydrogen ion activity, ''a<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub>'', can be defined<ref name=\"GoldBook\">{{GoldBookRef|title=activity (relative activity), ''a''|file=A00115}}</ref><ref name=\"GreenBook\">{{GreenBookRef2nd|pages=49\u201350}}</ref> as:\n:<math chem>a_\\ce{H+} = \\exp\\left (\\frac{\\mu_\\ce{H+} - \\mu^{\\ominus}_\\ce{H+}}{RT}\\right )</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub> is the [[chemical potential]] of the hydrogen ion, <math chem>\\mu^{\\ominus}_\\ce{H+}</math> is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state, ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature]]. Therefore, pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly due to different solvated proton ions such as lyonium ions, requiring an intersolvent scale which involves the transfer activity coefficient of [[lyonium ion|hydronium/lyonium ion]].\n\npH is an example of an [[acidity function]]. Other acidity functions can be defined. For example, the [[Hammett acidity function]], ''H''<sub>0</sub>, has been developed in connection with [[superacid]]s.\n\n===Unified absolute pH scale===\nThe concept of \"unified pH scale\" has been developed on the basis of the absolute chemical potential of the proton. This model uses the [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid\u2013base]] definition. This scale applies to liquids, gases and even solids.<ref name=\"Krossing\">{{cite journal | last1 = Himmel | first1 = D. | last2 = Goll | first2 = S.

When an [[acid]] is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7 (25&nbsp;\u00b0C). When a [[base (chemistry)|base]], or [[alkali]], is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as [[hydrochloric acid]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup> has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as [[sodium hydroxide]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration.\n\nThe pH of neutrality is not exactly 7 (25&nbsp;\u00b0C), although this is a good approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] (or the activities are equal). Since [[self-ionization of water]] holds the product of these concentration [H<sup>+</sup>]&times;[OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] = K<sub>w</sub>, it can be seen that at neutrality [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] = {{radic|K<sub>w</sub>}}, or pH = pK<sub>w</sub>/2. pK<sub>w</sub> is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] in pure water are both neutral, since [[Self-ionization of water|dissociation of water]] produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on [[ionic strength]], so K<sub>w</sub> varies with ionic strength.\n\nIf pure water is exposed to air it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from the air, which is then slowly converted into [[bicarbonate]] and hydrogen ions (essentially creating [[carbonic acid]]).\n:<chem>CO2 + H2O <=> HCO3^- + H+</chem>\n\n===pH in soil===\n\n====Classification of soil pH ranges====\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]], formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows:\n<ref>{{cite web|author=Soil Survey Division Staff|url=http://soils.usda.gov/technical/manual/contents/chapter3.html |title=Soil survey manual.1993.

These solutions have a relatively low [[ionic strength]] (\u22480.1) compared to that of seawater (\u22480.7), and, as a consequence, are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic strength differences cause changes in [[standard electrode potential|electrode potential]]. To resolve this problem, an alternative series of buffers based on [[artificial seawater]] was developed.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0011-7471(73)90101-0|author=Hansson, I.|year=1973|title=A new set of pH-scales and standard buffers for seawater|journal=Deep-Sea Research|volume=20|pages=479\u2013491|issue=5|bibcode=1973DSROA..20..479H}}</ref> This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred to as the 'total scale', often denoted as pH<sub>T</sub>.

In seawater, for instance, sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (>400 times) than those of fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small.\n\nThe following three equations summarise the three scales of pH:\n\n:pH<sub>F</sub> = \u2212 log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub>\n:pH<sub>T</sub> = \u2212 log ( [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}] ) = \u2212 log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>T</sub>\n:pH<sub>SWS</sub> = \u2212 log ( [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>F</sub> + [HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}] + [HF] ) = \u2212 log [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>SWS</sub>\n\nIn practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their values by up to 0.12 pH units, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean's [[Total inorganic carbon|carbonate system]].<ref name=zeebe /> Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions, the free scale is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales.

The most common disorder in acid-base homeostasis is [[acidosis]], which means an acid overload in the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35. [[Alkalosis]] is the opposite condition, with blood pH being excessively high.\n\nThe pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.365. This value is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. [[Dental plaque|Plaque]] can create a local acidic environment that can result in [[tooth decay]] by demineralization.

It can be seen that the ranges are kept in a narrow range, and that free protons are among the compounds with the very smallest mass concentrations.]]\n</div> -->\n\n==Calculations of pH==\nThe calculation of the pH of a solution containing acids and/or bases is an example of a chemical speciation calculation, that is, a mathematical procedure for calculating the concentrations of all chemical species that are present in the solution. The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution. For strong acids and bases no calculations are necessary except in extreme situations. The pH of a solution containing a weak acid requires the solution of a [[quadratic equation]]. The pH of a solution containing a weak base may require the solution of a [[cubic equation]]. The general case requires the solution of a set of [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s.\n\nA complicating factor is that water itself is a weak acid and a weak base (see [[amphoterism]]). It [[self-ionization of water|dissociates]] according to the equilibrium\n:<chem>2H2O <=> H3O+ (aq) + OH^-(aq)</chem>\nwith a [[acid dissociation constant|dissociation constant]], {{mvar|K<sub>w</sub>}} defined as\n:<math chem>K_w = \\ce{[H+][OH^-]}</math>\nwhere [H<sup>+</sup>] stands for the concentration of the aqueous [[hydronium ion]] and [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] represents the concentration of the [[hydroxide ion]]. This equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is extremely low.\n\n===Strong acids and bases===\n[[Strong acid]]s and [[Strong base|bases]] are compounds that, for practical purposes, are completely dissociated in water. Under normal circumstances this means that the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic solution can be taken to be equal to the concentration of the acid. The pH is then equal to minus the logarithm of the concentration value. [[Hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) is an example of a strong acid. The pH of a 0.01M solution of HCl is equal to \u2212log<sub>10</sub>(0.01), that is, pH = 2. [[Sodium hydroxide]], NaOH, is an example of a strong base. The p[OH] value of a 0.01M solution of NaOH is equal to \u2212log<sub>10</sub>(0.01), that is, p[OH] = 2. From the definition of p[OH] above, this means that the pH is equal to about 12. For solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations the self-ionization equilibrium must be taken into account.\n\nSelf-ionization must also be considered when concentrations are extremely low. Consider, for example, a solution of hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 5\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>M.  The simple procedure given above would suggest that it has a pH of 7.3. This is clearly wrong as an acid solution should have a pH of less than 7. Treating the system as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and the [[amphoteric]] substance water, a pH of 6.89 results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=Chris|title=pH calculation of a very small concentration of a strong acid.|url=http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|accessdate=13 March 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708062942/http://sinophibe.blogspot.com/2011/03/ph-calculation-of-very-small.html|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Weak acids and bases===\n\nA weak acid  or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism.\n:<math chem>\\begin{cases}\n\\ce{Acid:} & \\ce{HA <=> H+ + A^-}\\\\\n\\ce{Base:} & \\ce{HA+ <=> H+ + A}\n\\end{cases}</math>\nFirst, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac \\ce{[H] [A]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nand its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so, there are three unknown concentrations, [HA], [H<sup>+</sup>] and [A<sup>\u2212</sup>] to determine by calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to apply the law of  [[mass conservation]] in terms of the two \"reagents\" H and A.\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{A} = \\ce{[A]}  +  \\ce{[HA]}</math>\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{H} = \\ce{[H]}  +  \\ce{[HA]}</math>\nC stands for [[analytical concentration]]. In some texts, one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below. Together with the equation defining K<sub>a</sub>, there are now three equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water C<sub>A</sub> = C<sub>H</sub> = C<sub>a</sub>, the concentration of the acid, so [A] = [H]. After some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.\n:<math chem>[\\ce H]^2 + K_a[\\ce H] - K_a C_a = 0</math>\nSolution of this [[quadratic equation]] gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p[H] or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an [[ICE table]] which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional  (strong) acid or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when C<sub>A</sub> \u2260 C<sub>H</sub>.\n\nFor example, what is the pH of a 0.01M solution of [[benzoic acid]], pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.19?\n\n* Step 1: <math>K_a = 10^{-4.19} = 6.46\\times10^{-5}</math>\n* Step 2: Set up the quadratic equation. <math chem>[\\ce{H}]^2 + 6.46\\times 10^{-5}[\\ce{H}] - 6.46\\times 10^{-7} = 0 </math>\n* Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation. <math chem>[\\ce{H+}] = 7.74\\times 10^{-4};\\quad \\mathrm{pH} = 3.11</math>\nFor alkaline solutions an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation for hydrogen. Since addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-ionization equilibrium to be equal to <math chem>\\frac{K_w}\\ce{[H+]}</math>\n:<math chem>C_\\ce{H} = \\frac{[\\ce H] + [\\ce{HA}] -K_w}\\ce{[H]}</math>\nIn this case the resulting equation in [H] is a cubic equation.\n\n===General method===\nSome systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Billo |first1=E.J. |title= EXCEL for Chemists|edition= 3rd |year= 2011|publisher= Wiley-VCH|isbn= 978-0-470-38123-6}}</ref> With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as A<sub>p</sub>B<sub>q</sub>H<sub>r</sub>,the following general method can be used to calculate the pH of a solution. For example, with three reagents, each equilibrium is characterized by an equilibrium constant, \u03b2.\n:<math chem>[\\ce{A}_p\\ce{B}_q\\ce{H}_r] =\\beta_{pqr}[\\ce A]^{p}[\\ce B]^{q}[\\ce H]^{r}</math>\nNext, write down the mass-balance equations for each reagent:\n:<math chem>\\begin{align}\nC_\\ce{A} &= [\\ce A] + \\Sigma p \\beta_{pqr}[\\ce A]^p[\\ce B]^q[\\ce H]^{r} \\\\\nC_\\ce{B} &= [\\ce B] + \\Sigma q \\beta_{pqr}[\\ce A]^p[\\ce B]^q[\\ce H]^r \\\\\nC_\\ce{H} &= [\\ce H] + \\Sigma r \\beta_{pqr}[\\ce A]^p[\\ce B]^q[\\ce H]^r - K_w[\\ce H]^{-1}\n\\end{align}</math>\nNote that there are no approximations involved in these equations, except that each stability constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations, not activities. Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used.\n\nThere are 3 [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s in the three unknowns, [A], [B] and [H]. Because the equations are non-linear, and because concentrations may range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this formalism, is a key element in the [[determination of equilibrium constants]] by potentiometric titration.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alkaline diet]]\n* [[Arterial blood gas]]\n* [[Chemical equilibrium]]\n* [[pCO2]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|PH|lcfirst=yes}}\n*[http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/pdf/c1xacid2.pdf Chem1 Virtual Textbook, Acid-base Equilibria and Calculations]\n*[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa012803a.htm Red Cabbage pH Indicator]\n*[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/food-ph-d_403.html Food and Foodstuff \u2013 pH Values]\n*[http://www.aqion.onl Online pH Calculator for about 100 inorganic Acids, Bases, and Salts]\n*[https://www.wolkersdorfer.info/en/average-ph-value.html Calculation of mean pH] \n\n{{Wastewater}}{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ph}}\n[[Category:Acid\u2013base chemistry]]\n[[Category:Equilibrium chemistry]]\n[[Category:Units of measurement]]\n[[Category:Water quality indicators]]\n[[Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement]]\n[[Category:General chemistry]]\n", "name_user": "106.197.43.172", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"}

{"title_page": "Armature (computer animation)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2016}}\nAn '''armature''' is the name of the [[kinematic chain]]s used in [[computer animation]] to simulate the motions of virtual human or animal characters. In the context of animation, the [[inverse kinematics]] of the armature is the most relevant computational algorithm.\n\nThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures. [[Key frame|Keyframing]] armatures were initially developed to assist in animating digital characters without basing the movement on a live performance. The animator poses a device manually for each keyframe, while the character in the animation is set up with a mechanical structure equivalent to the armature. The device is connected to the animation software through a driver program and each move is recorded for a particular frame in time. [[Digital puppetry|Real-time]] armatures are similar, but they are puppeteered by one or more people and captured in real-time.\n\nInside of every puppet stop motion character is an Armature. Armature fills two main functions, It must move in a human-like manner in order to give life to character animation. The inner skeletal structure must be close to human-like as possible this includes having joint and finger flexibility. Human movements also involve spinning at the elbows, knees, shoulders and hips in order to bend down and pick up something from the ground. The second job of an armature is to not move. It is necessary that armature does not move, it must have some stiffness when positioned into place. \u201cyou don't want to be in the middle of a shoot with several minutes can pass by between each shot and have the puppets slowly drooping between one shoot and the next\u201d (Justatinyamount, 2018). In built geometric movement can extend into the hands and feet. Even facial movements are available in some armature figures. \n\u201cThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures\u201d (Wikipedia Article). Both Key framing and  methods consist of a series of connected joints and angular sensors in which they give \u201cDigital\u201d information to a computer. Armatures are described as, \u201cA structure that provides the base to the final layer of wax, clay or plaster. Historically, armatures were made of chicken wire, wood and many pounds of clay, making them very heavy\u201d (Computer Animation Complete, Parent, Rick).\n\n==Real-Time Puppeteering:==\nReal-time Puppeteering, simply means that the character skeleton is controlled by a human animator, by \u201csimple mapping between a hardware controller (such as a gamepad, a wiimote, a custom puppet controller, or even your body with a kinect based system) and the character\u2019s 3D animation armature\u201d (Three Real-Time Animation Methods, Hancock, Terry). Because of the nature of Puppeteering devices there is no attempt to control \u201cNatural Motion\u201d, you just simply manipulate the Digital puppet to do what you want. It takes some skill to do this like puppeteering, \u201cYou can take advantage of the puppeteer's skills, because these guys are masters. It\u2019s just amazing seeing them put their hand in a puppet and it just comes to life\u201d (\u201cComputer Animation Complete\u201d, Parent, Rick). Digital Real-Time Armature main difference, \u201cIt is controlled or we can say it is being puppets by people and the motions are captured in real time. This type of animation is used basically for 2D or 3D figures and objects created by using some 2D and 3D animation software. This type of animation armature is used for mainly filmmaking and Television production purposes. The film made using this technique is captured in real time by making the character move and capturing its live performance for the film\u201d (Virtualschooldek.com). Motions are recorded with digital software. Software such as Blender, \u201cBlender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline\u2014modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline\u201d (https://www.blender.org). This software allows the registering of data from Digital Armatures.  \n==Types of Armatures Build: ==\nAction Figures can also be converted into Armatures, for instance TV Shows such as Robot Chicken use modified forms of Armature Action Figures for their show. The most common toys for Armature are Lego\u2019s, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why they look great, they stay where you put them and you can move them around a reasonable amount\u201d (Youtube Video \u201cThe 3 main types of Armature\u201d). The only setback is their range of motion so this calls for them to be modified, so aluminium wire is inserted inside of them in order for joints to have a wider range of motion that seems organic to the character. In the \u201cLego Movie\u201d, the majority of the characters were Digital Armatures. Director Chris Miller, even used his childhood Lego Toy as the main character for the entire movie; \u201cChris Miller literally brought his broken space man toy which he had since he was a little kid \u2026 That\u2019s the level of detail and realism we wanna create (Film). Armatures was not the only method used but it was a hybrid effort of techniques in order to achieve the final product. Modifications can be done on figures such as LEGOs, such as installing wire through the character in order to have a fuller range of motion. Bringing life into toys is nothing new shows such as \u201cRobot Chicken\u201d implement, Action Figure Armatures in order for iconic doll super heroes to appear on the show. \nTwisted Wire Armature is another cost effective method used by animators, the only problem with this type of method is that joints are not strong and will lead to a drooping figure over time. Ball and Sockets Armatures have been the traditional method in which figures have been built, with a method such as this the plates inside the puppet are easily adjustable for stiffness. Balls and sockets can often be bulky so a Hybrid method between Twisted Wire Armature and Ball and Socket Armatures are created by animators in order for characters to move fluidly throughout the body. Ball and Socket Armature Kits are available for purchase, but these figures are often expensive. Descriptions for Kits include, \u201cThe Standard Armature Kit comes complete with everything you need to make your own armature. It is easy assembled and has been designed to meet most character designs. As well as double jointed ball and socket joints\u201d (Animation Supplies Website).\n==How Armatures Work:==\n\u201cPuppeteering armatures are very similar to keyframing armatures, expect the motion is captured in real time as performed by one or more puppeteers.\u201d( Parent, Rick and Computer Animation Complete) Through the use of tracking markers, sensors, hand controls, and animation software, \u201cpuppeteers\u201d are able to produce an animated performance in real time. Through a live performance conducted in real time, sensors and tracking markers attached to the performer help translate their body movements into the actions and expressions that the 3D digital armature replicates in real time. Rather than using an armature model with joints and built in sensors, this type of \u201creal time\u201d animation relies on a live performer and the movements they conduct to simulate the actions the 3D digital armature will follow. Aside from the sensors attached to the live performer used to record their body movements, face trackers are also used to record the performers facial expressions in real time as well . \u201c The most popular are the real-time optical face trackers, consisting of a camera that is placed in a structure attached to the performer\u2019s head so that it moves with the performer. The device captures the motion of small markers placed in different areas of the face.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Along with the body sensors these facial trackers allow the puppets to capture the real time expression and digitally animate it. However the application of facial tracks through real time simulations has a limit when it comes to its range of detail. \u201cUnfortunately, these are 2D devices that cannot capture certain motions such as puckering of the lips, so the data is all in one plane and not very realistic. Three-dimensional facial motion data can be captured with an optical system using two or more cameras, yielding a much better result, but not in real time.\u201d ( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Aside from the use of live performers in real time armatures, digital armatures made of joints, and sensors can also be used to simulate animated movement in real time. \u201cThe last commercially available example of a digital armature was the Monkey 2 by Digital Image Design in New York City. It was modular, so it could be assembled in different joint configurations.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) With modular capabilities embedded in the armature the puppeteers are allowed to maneuver the figure and transport it\u2019s actions digitally. \u201cBoth stop-motion and real time types consist of a series of rigid modules connected by joints whose rotations are measured by potentiometers or angular sensors. The sensors are usually analog devices, but they are called digital because the resulting readings are converted to digital signals to be processed by the computer system.These armatures are typically modular in order to accommodate different character designs.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) The modular design allows for these digital armature models to simulate movements that in an animated environment resemble those of a human or animal. \u201c The first-generation Monkey had a fixed configuration, which made it unusable for any non humanoid applications.\u201d(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) A modular armature helps overcome this problem and create a solid baseline that is capable of various movements and extensions. Now depending on the package contents that come with the digital armature model itself the price may vary. \u201c The typical cost for a 39-joint Monkey 2 setup was approximately $15,000, which included all the necessary parts as well as driver software for most well known animation packages.\u201d(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) Both the live performance and digital armature real time animation methods convert to digital formats allowing the puppeteers different ways to produce and create an animated visual. Through real time armatures \u201cMotus Digital\u201d is able to bring their creations to life and implement interactive settings within their animations. Through real time armature this company creates \u201cLarry the Zombie\u201d, an interactive character that they use in their business ventures. \u201cThis year Larry will take our Real-Time technology to the next level by attending the show himself, in search of \u201cThe Next Big Thing\u201d.  He will interview panelists, share his schedule and report what\u2019s going on and do whatever it takes to find the next big thing.  Unlike Elf Hotline that takes place at the \u201cNorth Pole\u201d, Larry lives in the real world and is keen on pop culture and world events.  Although the Real-Time interviews will be conducted via Skype, Larry\u2019s character will be composited into the shot giving Larry a real presence at this years South by SouthWest.\u201d( Motus Digital) Through real time armature this company shows how creative and interactive content can be created and shared with a larger audience.\n\n==Keyframing(Stop motion)==\nStop motion animation is captured one frame at a time and when they are played back it looks like movement. It is achieved by taking a picture of each individual frame and then editing it together in whatever software you may prefer. The more fluid you want the movements to look, the more frames you would need. Stop motion works just a flipbook but in a digital format. In this analogy frames would be equivalent to the pages in a flipbook, the more pages you have the more organic the movements look. Stop motion animation can be integrated into live action films or be completely animated. Live action movies like \u201cThe Terminator\u201d(1984) and \u201cRoboCop\u201d (1987) both had stop motion sequences. \n\n==Tim Burton: Armature Influence==\nTim Burton, a graduate from CalArts in southern california, was well aware of the stop motion techniques available to him. CalArts, founded by Walt Disney, in 1961 was innovating computer applications of armatures and other forms of computer designs.A popular example of stop motion are Tim Burton movies, his animated ones of course. \u201cNightmare before Christmas\u201d, \u201cCorpse Bride\u201d, \u201cCoraline\u201d,etc. A lot goes into making a stop motion film with the quality of a Tim Burton one. Everything you see on screen was made by someone in the crew. The set was built, the puppets were hand made and every single frame was an individual picture taken. On a behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cFrankenweenie\u201d one of the crew members shows one of their exposure sheets which is a stop motion equivalent to a shot list. The frames are broken down in phonetics(the sound a letter makes) which means it takes multiple frames to even make one word that a character may say. The crew member has to shape the puppet's mouth so that it matches every sound made in every word that the voice actor says in the dialogue. It is also mentioned in the video that even the smallest action such as blinking requires the puppets eyelids to be replaced each time. In the behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cCoraline\u201d crew members show how movement can look so fluid in stop motion by explaining the process of rigging. Rigging in stop motion is when someone uses mechanics like winding or pulling to propel a puppet or set piece through space. For example an animator may put an object on a piece of wire and move the wire in different positions and then edit the wire out in post production.  \n\tTim Burton\u2019s love for the old age technique of stop-motion animation, which has contributed a big part to its success is due to his obsession with the simple idea that this specific technique could really bring to life ideas that otherwise would be impossible. \u201cThe animation helped viewers identify with something that could not possibly exist.\u201d Burton\u2019s need to use stop-motion animation was due to the idea that \u201cit could bring something purely imagined to vivid life in a way that 2-D animation couldn\u2019t.\u201d This was amplified through his exploration with other works of art such as James Whale\u2019s Frankenstein, which helped focus on those ideas of monsters and his need to create them in his life. There is no question that Burton did exactly that with his work in The Nightmare Before Christmas which brought this technique back into the limelight. Although Burton worked with animators like John Lasseter who made Toy Story happen with computer animation he never lost focus on stop-motion animation. This helped him create amazing films such as Corps Bride and remake of his 1984 short film Frankenweenie. To no surprise Burton\u2019s original commercial for MoMA\u2019s exhibition was made with the age-old technique of stop-motion animation to honor the amazing creator. Although Tim Burton was not the original creator of this technique he was honored in part of the series to help represent the influence that his films have had on the technique. Other creators who have come before him in the field of stop-motion animation are Harryhausen \u201cthe subject of a MoMA retrospective\u2014Ray Harryhausen: Special Effects (May 28\u2013September 1, 1981)\u201d. Harryhausen who trained under Willis O\u2019Brien \u201ccreator of effects in King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949)\u201d.\n\narryhausen who trained under Willis O\u2019Brien \u201ccreator of effects in King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949)\u201d.\n\n==Wes Anderson: Armature Animation Influence==\nWes Anderson is a director who primarily makes live action films but he does have two stop motion animated movies \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d and \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d. Although these films are animated they still show Wes Anderson\u2019s signature style. In a behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d it\u2019s shown that animators used actual movement as a reference. They had real dogs on set so that they could have something to base their animation on. Also animators would film themselves walking or doing any action that they need to animate and then they would look at it when animating a human puppet. This helped them to make action look more fluid and realistic because they were using themselves as a reference. \n\n==History of Stop Motion==\nStop motion started in the late 1800\u2019s. The first ever Stop-motion film was released in 1898 \u201cThe Humpty Dumpty Circus\u201d created by J. Stuart Black and Albert E. Smith. It was popularized by the animator Willis O\u2019 Brien who mixed stop motion with live actors. His best known work was \u201cKing Kong\u201d(1933). In 1940 animator George Pal developed a technique called \u201creplacement animation\u201d. Instead of using clay or any other malleable material to change the puppet he created multiple wooden heads, each with a different facial expression and replaced the heads when conveying different emotions. In 1944 George Pal won an Oscar for this technique. In 1955 Art Clokey, a pioneer in claymation(stop motion with clay figures), created \u201cGumby\u201d for \u201cThe Howdy Doody Show\u201d. In 1961 he also created the children\u2019s show \u201cDavey and Goliath\u201d which was sponsored by the Lutheran Church. \n\n==Claymation==\nClaymation is a very popular type of Stop motion animation used by many different creators. Pioneered by Art Clokey as mentioned in the previous section, Claymation is still used by modern day animators. It was used by Tim Burton and Henry Selick in films like \u201cParaNorman\u201d \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Nightmare before Christmas\u201d. Director and animator Nick Park also used claymation in all of his \u201cChicken Run\u201d and \u201cWallace and Gromit\u201d movies. Rankin/Bass Productions Inc. also used claymation in Christmas special movies like \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\u201d(1964) and \u201cJack Frost\u201d(1979) both in which air on the network NBC. Although all of these films use clay and stop motion animation, they each have their own unique look and style. Claymation has evolved throughout the years because all creators have their own vision and clay is so malleable that it could make endless styles of characters and scenery. moving clay. In this technique pieces of clay are moulded to create characters and based on the imagination of the animator, a story is unfolded. There are oil based and water based clays available. Sometimes the clay is moulded into free forms or filled up in a wire like structure called armature. The animated characters are kept in a set and with only short movements, the whole scene is film. Famous examples of this technique being used are, Missing Link by Chris Butler , Kubo and the two strings by Travis Andrew Knight, Coraline by Charles Henry Selick, The Boxtrolls by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. \n\n==Other Animations techniques: ==\nStop motion: The illusion of movement achieved by moving a figure in tiny increments between each photographed frame\nObject-Motion: moving or animating objects, this is a form of stop motion animation that uses physical items instead of drawn objects which are not meant to be a human or recognizable character. \nPuppet Animation: moving puppets, a unique phenomenon. It's born out of the hard work of its pioneers and their followers to bring creative impulses to life by experimenting with new technologie. in cinema a great example of this technique being used is in the film King Kong (1933). The writer/director Tim Burton often uses puppet animation in his work for example, Corpse Bride (2005) which is a stop motion animated horror musical.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n<ref>{{cite book| title=Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games| last=Menache| first=Alberto| date=2000| publisher=Morgan Kaufmann| ISBN=9780124906303}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Linkage (mechanical)|Linkages]]\n* [[Skeletal animation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:3D graphics software]]\n[[Category:Computational physics]]\n\n\n{{compu-graphics-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2016}}\nAn '''armature''' is the name of the [[kinematic chain]]s used in [[computer animation]] to simulate the motions of virtual human or animal characters.

Attorney and media legal analyst [[Danny Cevallos]] said: \"[the judge] absolutely is obliged to consider very seriously the [probation department] report,\" and noted that the California penal code allows a judge to depart from the statutory minimum (two years) after considering the defendant's lack of criminal history and the effect of incarceration.

The civil trial came after the District Attorney had declined to prosecute a criminal case, as she thought evidence was lacking. During the civil trial, Persky decided that the jury should be allowed to view photographs of the plaintiff taken at another party she attended approximately a year after the alleged gang rape, as per the defense's claim that this evidence contradicted the plaintiff's claims of suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=\"WaltersWongLevin\"/> The jury found the defendants not liable.<ref name=\"AutoMQ-30\"/>\n\nFollowing Turner's sentencing in 2016, the plaintiff's attorneys in the De Anza case criticized Persky for allowing the photos into evidence. Attorneys for Doe said the photographs were not the only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. Four of the baseball players had invoked [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. According to a lawyer for Doe, that was a critical juncture: it prevented their legal team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could refuse to testify, but that meant that they would be prohibited from subsequently testifying in the case. That prohibition was lifted by Persky after he took over the trial in 2011, a move that Doe's attorneys say undermined her case.<ref name=\"WaltersWongLevin\"/>\n\n==Statements==\n\n===Defendant's statements===\nAfter the guilty verdict, Turner said\nto his probation officer that the encounter was consensual.<ref name=\"AutoMQ-31\"/> He also gave an 11-page statement to the judge<ref name=Cleary/> that said he received verbal consent from the woman before she passed out.\n\nAccording to Turner's statement, he and the woman drank, danced, and kissed at the party.

A group of 70 public defenders petitioned in support of Persky, warning against \"mass incarceration\" brought upon by state legislatures or indiscreet judges, and fearing that the backlash against Persky could hurt their clients (mostly poor African and Latino) by compelling judges to give out harsh sentences. Deputy Public Defender Sajid Khan wrote \"rather than using robotic, one size fits all punishment schemes, we want judges, like Judge Persky, to engage in thoughtful, case by case, individualized determinations of the appropriate sentence for a particular crime and particular offender\".<ref name=\"jezebel.com\"/><ref name=\"themarshallproject.org\"/> Santa Clara County [[district attorney]] Jeff Rosen, whose office prosecuted Turner and did not appeal the sentence, stated, \"While I strongly disagree with the sentence that Judge Persky issued in the Brock Turner case, I do not believe he should be removed from his judgeship\",<ref name=Stack7/> adding, \"Judicial independence is a critical part of the U.S. justice system.

The civil trial came after the District Attorney had declined to prosecute a criminal case, as she thought evidence was lacking. During the civil trial, Persky decided that the jury should be allowed to view photographs of the plaintiff taken at another party she attended approximately a year after the alleged gang rape, as per the defense's claim that this evidence contradicted the plaintiff's claims of suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=\"WaltersWongLevin\"/> The jury found the defendants not liable.<ref name=\"AutoMQ-30\"/>\n\nFollowing Turner's sentencing in 2016, the plaintiff's attorneys in the De Anza case criticized Persky for allowing the photos into evidence. Attorneys for Doe said the photographs were not the only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. Four of the baseball players had invoked [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. According to a lawyer for Doe, that was a critical juncture: it prevented their legal team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could refuse to testify, but that meant that they would be prohibited from subsequently testifying in the case. That prohibition was lifted by Persky after he took over the trial in 2011, a move that Doe's attorneys say undermined her case.<ref name=\"WaltersWongLevin\"/>\n\n==Statements==\n\n===Defendant's statements===\nAfter the guilty verdict, Turner said\nto his probation officer that the encounter was consensual.<ref name=\"AutoMQ-31\"/> He also gave an 11-page statement to the judge<ref name=Cleary/> that said he received verbal consent from the woman before she passed out.\n\nAccording to Turner's statement, he and the woman drank, danced, and kissed at the party. Sometime around midnight, according to Turner, he asked her whether she would like to go back to his dorm and she said yes.

He also acknowledged under cross-examination by defense attorney Armstrong that the tests do not show when the DNA was deposited.

This page established the basic requirements of the \"''Miranda'' warning\".]]\n\n{{Law enforcement in the United States}}\n\nIn the [[United States]], the '''''Miranda'' warning''' is a type of notification customarily given by [[Law enforcement in the United States|police]] to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a [[custodial interrogation]]) advising them of their [[right to silence]]; that is, their right to refuse to answer questions or provide information to law enforcement or other officials. These rights are often referred to as '''''Miranda''''' '''rights'''. The purpose of such notification is to preserve the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility of their statements]] made during custodial interrogation in later criminal proceedings.\n\nThe language used in a ''Miranda'' warning is derived from the 1966 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 US 436 (1966).<ref name=Miranda>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1965/759|title=Miranda v.

Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions. You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.}}\n\nThe ''Miranda'' warning is part of a preventive criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against compelled self-incrimination. In ''Miranda v. Arizona'', the Supreme Court held that the [[admissible evidence|admission]] of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment right to counsel]], through the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] of these rights into state law.{{#tag:ref|The 2004 United States Supreme Court ruling ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' upheld state \"[[Stop and Identify statutes|stop-and-identify]]\" laws, allowing police in those jurisdictions engaging in a [[Terry stop]] to require biographical information such as name and address, without arresting suspects or providing them Miranda warnings.|group=\"Note\"}} Thus, if law enforcement officials decline to offer a ''Miranda'' warning to an individual in their custody, they may interrogate that person and act upon the knowledge gained, but may not use that person's statements as evidence against them in a criminal trial.\n\n==Origin and development of ''Miranda'' rights==\n[[File:CBP Border Patrol agent reads the Miranda rights.jpg|thumb|A [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] agent reading the Miranda rights to a suspect]]\nThe concept of \"''Miranda'' rights\" was enshrined in U.S. law following the 1966 ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' Supreme Court decision, which found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of [[Ernesto Miranda|Ernesto Arturo Miranda]] had been violated during his arrest and trial for armed robbery, kidnapping, and rape of a mentally handicapped young woman. \n\nMiranda was subsequently retried and convicted, based primarily on his estranged ex-partner, who had been tracked down by the original arresting officer via Miranda's own parents, suddenly claiming that Miranda had confessed to her when she had visited him in jail; Miranda's lawyer later confessed that he 'goofed' the trial.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S5y-y-0qpa4C&pg=PA262&dq=goofed#v=onepage&q=goofed&f=false|title=The Devil's Advocates: Greatest Closing Arguments in Criminal Law|last=Lief|first=Michael S.|last2=Caldwell|first2=H. Mitchell|date=2006-08-29|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743246682|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda rights, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The Supreme Court did not specify the exact wording to use when informing a suspect of their rights. However, the Court did create a set of guidelines that must be followed. The ruling states:\n\n{{quote|...The person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he/she has the [[right to silence|right to remain silent]], and that anything the person says will be used against that person in court; the person must be clearly informed that he/she has the right to consult with an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning, and that, if he/she is [[poverty|indigent]], an attorney will be provided at no cost to represent him/her.}}\n\nIn ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'' (1984), the Supreme Court decided that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in ''Miranda'', regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which they are suspected or for which they were arrested.<ref>''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, [[American English]] developed the [[verb]] ''Mirandize'', meaning \"read the ''Miranda'' rights to\" a suspect (when the suspect is arrested).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title=Mirandize |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mirandize |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>\n\nNotably, the ''Miranda'' rights do not have to be read in any particular order, and they do not have to precisely match the language of the ''Miranda'' case as long as they are adequately and fully conveyed (''[[California v. Prysock]]'', {{ussc|453|355|1981}}<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/355/ ''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355 (1981)].</ref>).\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court held that unless a suspect expressly states that they are invoking this right, subsequent voluntary statements made to an officer can be used against them in court, and police can continue to interact with (or question) the alleged criminal.\n\n==The warnings==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nEvery U.S. jurisdiction has its own regulations regarding what, precisely, must be said to a person arrested or placed in a custodial situation. The typical warning states:<ref>{{cite news|title=Typical reading of Miranda rights|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/29/loc_typical_reading_of.html|date=August 29, 2001}}</ref>\n* You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.\n* Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.\n* You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.\n* If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.\n* If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.\n* Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?\n\nThe courts have since ruled that the warning must be \"meaningful\", so it is usually required that the suspect be asked if they understand their rights. Sometimes, firm answers of \"yes\" are required. Some departments and jurisdictions require that an officer ask \"do you understand?\" after every sentence in the warning. An arrestee's silence is not a waiver, but on June 1, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that police are allowed to interrogate suspects who have invoked or waived their rights ambiguously, and any statement given during questioning prior to invocation or waiving is admissible as evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704875604575280392747737022|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Jess|last=Bravin|title=Justices Narrow Miranda Rule|date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> Evidence has in some cases been ruled inadmissible because of an arrestee's poor knowledge of English and the failure of arresting officers to provide the warning in the arrestee's language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Einesman |first=Floralynn |title=Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of ''Miranda'' and Diversity |journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]] |year=1999 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201348 [p. 41] |jstor=1144162 |id={{NCJ|182327}} |doi=10.2307/1144162 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol90/iss1/1 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the exact language above is not required by ''Miranda'', the police must advise the suspect that:\n# they have the right to remain silent;\n# anything the suspect ''does'' say can and may be used against them in a court of law;\n# they have the right to have an attorney present before and during the questioning; and\n# they have the right, if they cannot afford the services of an attorney, to have one appointed, at public expense and without cost to them, to represent them before and during the questioning.<ref>State and Federal courts have consistently rejected challenges to Miranda warnings on grounds that defendant was not advised of additional rights. See, e.g., ''United States v. Coldwell'', 954 F.2d 496(8th Cir. 1992) For example, police are not required to advise a suspect that if he decides to answer questions without an attorney present, he still has the right to stop answering at any time until he talks to an attorney. Note that the Miranda warnings are not part of the arrest procedure. There is no constitutional requirement that the officer advise the defendant of their Miranda rights when they place the defendant under arrest.</ref>\nThere is no precise language that must be used in advising a suspect of their Miranda rights.<ref>''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355, 101 S. Ct. 2806, 69 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1981); ''Brown v. Crosby'', 249 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (S.D. Fla. 2003).</ref> The point is that whatever language is used the substance of the rights outlined above must be communicated to the suspect.<ref>''Duckworth v. Eagan'', 492 U.S. 195, 109 S. Ct. 2875, 106 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1989) While a \"talismanic incantation\" of the exact language of the original Miranda warnings is not required, [Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure, 5th ed. (Aspen 2006) 268] deviations and omission can result in suppression of the statement.</ref> The suspect may be advised of their rights orally or in writing.<ref>''U.S. v. Labrada-Bustamante'', 428 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir. 2005).</ref> Also, officers must make sure the suspect understands what the officer is saying, taking into account potential education levels. It may be necessary to \"translate\" to the suspect's level of understanding. Courts have ruled this admissible as long as the original waiver is said and the \"translation\" is recorded either on paper or on tape.\n\nThe Supreme Court has resisted efforts to require officers to more fully advise suspects of their rights. For example, the police are not required to advise the suspect that they can stop the interrogation at any time, that the decision to exercise the right cannot be used against the suspect, or that they have a right to talk to a lawyer before being asked any questions. Nor have the courts required to explain the rights. For example, the standard Miranda right to counsel states ''You have a right to have an attorney present during the questioning''. Police are not required to explain that this right is not merely a right to have a lawyer present while the suspect is being questioned. The right to counsel includes:\n* the right to talk to a lawyer before deciding whether to talk to police,\n* if the defendant decides to talk to the police, the right to consult with a lawyer before being interrogated,\n* the right to answer police only through an attorney.<ref>Gregory Declue, [http://www.aele.org/law/2009-08MLJ501.html Oral Miranda warnings: A checklist and a model presentation], ''The Journal of Psychiatry & Law'' (2007) at 421.</ref>\n\n===Circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' requisites===\nThe circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' safeguards, i.e. Miranda warnings, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Suspects in \"custody\" who are about to be interrogated must be properly advised of their Miranda rights\u2014namely, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination (and, in furtherance of this right, the right to counsel while in custody). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and have an attorney present during the interrogation. The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination is the right to remain silent\u2014the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information.\n\nThe duty to warn only arises when police officers conduct custodial interrogations. The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure, or once an officer has probable cause to arrest, or if the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation. Custody and interrogation are the events that trigger the duty to warn.\n\n===Use in various U.S. state jurisdictions===\n[[File:Fugitive felon life magazine.jpg|thumb|Police detectives read the Miranda rights to a fugitive felon, 1984 (photography: J. Ross Baughman)]]\nSome jurisdictions provide the right of a juvenile to remain silent if their parent or guardian is not present. Some departments in [[New Jersey]], [[Nevada]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Alaska]] modify the \"providing an attorney\" clause as follows:\n\n{{quote|We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court.}}\n\nEven though this sentence may be somewhat ambiguous to some laypersons, who can, and who ''have'' actually interpreted it as meaning that they will not get a lawyer until they confess and are arraigned in court, the U.S. Supreme Court has approved of it as an accurate description of the procedure in those states.<ref>''[[Duckworth v.

If the suspect responds \"no\" to the first question, the officer is required to re-read the Miranda warning, while saying \"no\" to the second question invokes the right at that moment; in either case the interviewing officer or officers cannot question the suspect until the rights are waived.\n\nGenerally, when defendants invoke their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify or submit to cross-examination at trial, the prosecutor cannot indirectly punish them for the exercise of a constitutional right by commenting on their silence and insinuating that it is an implicit admission of guilt.<ref>''[[Griffin v. California]]'', {{ussc|380|609|1965}}.</ref> Since ''Miranda'' rights are simply a judicial gloss upon the Fifth Amendment which protects against coercive interrogations, the same rule also prevents prosecutors from commenting about the post-arrest silence of suspects who invoke their ''Miranda'' rights immediately after arrest.<ref>''[[Wainwright v. Greenfield]]'', {{ussc|474|284|1986}}.</ref> However, neither the Fifth Amendment nor ''Miranda'' extend to ''pre-arrest'' silence, which means that if a defendant takes the witness stand at trial (meaning he just waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent), the prosecutor can attack his credibility with his pre-arrest silence (based on his failure to immediately turn himself in and confess to the things he voluntarily testified about at trial).<ref>''[[Jenkins v. Anderson]]'', {{ussc|447|231|1980}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], Article 31<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/831- Article 31].</ref> provides for the right against compelled self-incrimination. Interrogation subjects under Army jurisdiction must first be given Department of the Army Form 3881, which informs them of the charges and their rights, and the subjects must sign the form. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps require that all arrested personnel be read the \"rights of the accused\" and must sign a form waiving those rights if they so desire; a verbal waiver is not sufficient.\n\nIt has been discussed{{by whom|date=November 2010}} whether a Miranda warning\u2014if spoken or in writing\u2014could be appropriately given to [[disability|disabled persons]]. For example, \"the right to remain silent\" means little to a [[deaf]] individual and the word \"constitutional\" may not be understood by people with only an elementary education. In one case, a deaf murder suspect was kept at a therapy station until he was able to understand the meaning of the Miranda warning and other judicial proceedings.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Deaf Murderers: Clinical and Forensic Issues |journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=495\u2013516 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0798(199910/12)17:4<495::AID-BSL361>3.0.CO;2-6 |first1=McCay |last1=Vernon |first2=Annie G. |last2=Steinberg |first3=Louise A. |last3=Montoya}}</ref>\n\n==The six rules==\nThe Miranda rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings that is the product of custodial police interrogation. The Miranda right to counsel and right to remain silent are derived from the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>The Miranda rule is not an element of a valid arrest. The Fifth Amendment does not require an officer to give an arrestee his Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure. The Miranda rights are triggered by custody and interrogation. At the time the Supreme Court decided Miranda the Fifth Amendment had already been applied to the states in ''Malloy v. Hogan'', 378 U.S. 1 (1964)</ref> Therefore, for Miranda to apply, six requirements must be fulfilled:\n\n; 1. Evidence must have been gathered.\n: If the suspect did not make a statement during the interrogation the fact that he was not advised of his Miranda rights is of no importance.<ref>Note that post warning silence cannot be used as evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's trial testimony. ''Doyle v. Ohio'', 426 U.S. 610 (1976).</ref> Nor can the state offer evidence that the defendant asserted his rights\u2014that he refused to talk.\n; 2. The evidence must be testimonial.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\">''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n: Miranda applies only to \"testimonial\" evidence as that term is defined under the Fifth Amendment.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\"/> For purposes of the Fifth Amendment, testimonial statements mean communications that explicitly or implicitly relate a factual assertion [an assertion of fact or belief] or disclose information.<ref>''Doe v. United States'', 487 U.S. 201 (1988).</ref><ref>See also ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218 (1967).</ref> The Miranda rule does not prohibit compelling a person to engage in non-assertive conduct that is incriminating or may produce incriminating evidence. Thus, requiring a suspect to participate in identification procedures such as giving [[handwriting exemplar|handwriting]]<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis)331 n. 203 citing ''United States v. Daughenbaugh'', 49 F.3d 171, 173 (5th Cir. 1995).</ref> or voice exemplars,<ref>''United States v. Mitchell'', 556 F.2d 382 (6th Cir. 1977).</ref> fingerprints, DNA samples, hair samples, and dental impressions is not within the Miranda rule. Such physical or real evidence is non-testimonial and not protected by the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause.<ref>''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S 582 (1990).</ref> On the other hand, certain non-verbal conduct may be testimonial. For example, if the suspect nodded their head up and down in response to the question \"did you kill the victim\", the conduct is testimonial, is the same as saying \"yes I did\", and Miranda would apply.<ref>See ''Schmerber v. California'', 384 U.S. 757, 761 n. 5 (1966).</ref>\n; 3. The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody.<ref>''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody. This limitation follows from the fact that Miranda's purpose is to protect suspects from the compulsion inherent in the police-dominated atmosphere attendant to arrest. Custody means either that the suspect was under arrest or that his freedom of movement was restrained to an extent \"associated with a formal arrest\".<ref>''[[Stansbury v. California]]'', 114 S. Ct. 1526 (1994); ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984). Some courts phrased the requirement as the defendant did not believe that he was \"free to leave\". This standard is comparable to the detention standard for purposes of the fourth amendment\u2014not the functional arrest standard for purposes of the fifth amendment.<!-- Unable to verify 'detention standard' annotation in cited cases. --></ref> A formal arrest occurs when an officer, with the intent to make an arrest, takes a person into custody by the use of physical force or the person submits to the control of an officer who has indicated his intention to arrest the person. Telling a person he is \"under arrest\" is sufficient to satisfy this requirement even though the person may not be otherwise physically restrained.<ref>Adams & Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (LEXIS 1998) at 306.</ref> Absent a formal arrest, the issue is whether a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have believed that he was under \"full custodial\" arrest.<ref>In deciding whether a person is in \"constructive custody\" the courts use a totality of the circumstances test. Factors frequently examined include\n# the location of the interrogation\n# the force used to stop or detain the suspect\n# the number officer and police vehicles involved\n# whether the officers were in uniform\n# whether the officers were visibly armed\n# the tone of officer's voice\n# whether the suspect was told they were free to leave\n# the length of the detention and/or interrogation\n# whether the suspect was confronted with incriminating evidence and\n# whether the accused was the focus of the investigation.</ref> Applying this objective test, the Court has held Miranda does not apply to roadside questioning of a stopped motorist or to questioning of a person briefly detained on the street\u2014a [[Terry stop]].<ref>See ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984) (brief roadside investigatory detention is not custody) and ''California v. Beheler'', 463 U.S. 1121 (1983) (''per curiam'').</ref> Even though neither the motorist nor the pedestrian is free to leave, this interference with the freedom of action is not considered actual arrest or its functional equivalent for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984).</ref> The court has similarly held that a person who voluntarily comes to the police station for purposes of questioning is not in custody and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings particularly when the police advise the suspect that he is not under arrest and free to leave.<ref>Miranda is not offense or investigation-specific. Therefore, absent a valid waiver, a person in custody cannot be interrogated about the offense they are held in custody for, or any other offense.</ref>\n; 4. The evidence must have been the product of interrogation.<ref>''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', 446 U.S. 291 (1980)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been the product of interrogation. A defendant who seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement under Miranda must show that the statement was \"prompted by police conduct that constituted 'interrogation'\".<ref>Imwinkelried and Blinka, Criminal Evidentiary Foundations, 2d ed. (Lexis 2007) {{ISBN|1-4224-1741-7}} at 620.</ref> A volunteered statement by a person in custody does not implicate Miranda. In ''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', the Supreme Court defined interrogation as express questioning and \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect\". Thus, a practice that the police \"should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect ... amounts to interrogation\". For example, confronting the suspect with incriminating evidence may be sufficiently evocative to amount to interrogation because the police are implicitly communicating a question: \"How do you explain this?\"<ref>See ''[[Edwards v. Arizona]]'', 451 U.S. 477 (1981).</ref> On the other hand, \"unforeseeable results of police words or actions\" do not constitute interrogation. Under this definition, routine statements made during the administration of sobriety tests would not implicate Miranda. For example, a police officer arrests a person for impaired driving and takes him to the police station to administer an intoxilyzer test. While at the station the officer also asks the defendant to perform certain psycho-physical tests such as the walk and turn, one leg stand or finger to nose test. It is standard practice to instruct the arrestee on how to perform the test and to demonstrate the test. (Note that the police ''will not'' tell the person that they have the right to refuse to perform the test, and the refusal cannot be used in evidence against them, nor can they be in any way punished for refusing to perform it, same as the police will not tell someone that they may refuse to perform a roadside sobriety test without penalty). An incriminating statement made by an arrestee during the instruction, \"I couldn't do that even if I was sober\", would not be the product of interrogation. Similarly, incriminating statements made in response to requests for consent to search a vehicle or other property are not considered to be the product of interrogation.<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis 1998)331 n. 204 citing United States v. Smith, 3 F.3d. 1088 (7th Cir. 1993)</ref>\n; 5. The interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', 378 U.S. 478 (1964); ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 110 S. Ct. 2394 (1990). See also Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, (Greenwood Press 1991), citing ''Walter v. United States'', 447 U.S. 649 (1980)</ref>\n: To establish a violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, the defendant must show state action, so the interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>See Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, 97 n. 86 (Goodwood Press 1991) quoting Kamisar, LaFave & Israel, Basic Criminal Procedure 598 (6th ed. 1986) \"whatever may lurk in the heart or mind of the fellow prisoner ..., if it is not 'custodial police interrogation' ''in the eye of the beholder'', then it is not ... interrogation within the meaning of Miranda\".</ref> If the interrogation was conducted by a person known by the suspect to be a law enforcement officer the state action requirement is unquestionably met. On the other hand, where a private citizen obtains a statement there is no state action regardless of the custodial circumstances surrounding the statement. A confession obtained through the interrogation by an undercover police officer or a paid informant does not violate ''Miranda'' because there is no coercion, no police dominated atmosphere if the suspect does not know that they are being questioned by the police. Private security guards and \"private\" police present special problems. They are generally not regarded as state-agents. However, an interrogation conducted by a police officer moonlighting as a security guard may well trigger Miranda's safeguards since an officer is considered to be \"on duty\" at all times.<ref>See ''Commonwealth v. Leone'', 386 Mass. 329 (1982).</ref>\n; 6. The evidence must be offered by the state during a criminal prosecution.<ref>The Fifth Amendment applies only to compelled statements used in criminal proceedings</ref>\n: The evidence is being offered during a criminal proceeding. Under the exclusionary rule, a Miranda-defective statement cannot be used by the prosecution as substantive evidence of guilt. However, the Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule applies only to criminal proceedings. In determining whether a particular proceeding is criminal, the courts look at the punitive nature of the sanctions that could be imposed. Labels are irrelevant. The question is whether the consequences of an outcome adverse to the defendant could be characterized as punishment. Clearly a criminal trial is a criminal proceeding since if convicted the defendant could be fined or imprisoned. However, the possibility of loss of liberty does not make the proceeding criminal in nature. For example, commitment proceedings are not criminal proceedings even though they can result in long confinement because the confinement is considered rehabilitative in nature and not punishment. Similarly, ''Miranda'' does not apply directly to probation revocation proceedings because the evidence is not being used as a basis for imposing additional punishment.\n\n===Application of the prerequisites===\nAssuming that the six requirements are present and ''Miranda'' applies, the statement will be subject to suppression unless the prosecution can demonstrate:\n* that the suspect was advised of their ''Miranda'' rights, and\n* that the suspect voluntarily waived those rights or that the circumstances fit an exception to the ''Miranda'' rule.\nThe defendant may also be able to challenge the admissibility of the statement under provisions of state constitutions and state criminal procedure statutes.<ref>Other bases for exclusion include that the confession was the product of an unconstitutional arrest [See Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975); [[Dunaway v. New York]], 442 U.S. 200 (1979)], the confession was obtained in violation of the defendant's sixth amendment right to counsel or the confession was involuntary under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that immigrants who live in the United States illegally are also protected and should receive their Miranda warnings as well when being interrogated or placed under arrest. \"[[Alien (law)|Aliens]] receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and [have] developed substantial connections with this country\".<ref>Einesman, F: \"Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of Miranda and Diversity\", p. 9. ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', 1999.</ref>\n\nThe Fifth Amendment right to counsel, a component of the ''Miranda'' Rule, is different from the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In the context of the law of confessions the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is defined by the [[Massiah v. United States|Massiah]] Doctrine (''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964)).\n\n==Waiver==\nSimply advising the suspect of their rights does not fully comply with the Miranda rule. The suspect must also voluntarily waive their Miranda rights before questioning can proceed.<ref name=Miranda /> An express waiver is not necessary.<ref>''United States v. Melanson'', 691 F.2d 579 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 856 (1981).</ref> However, most law enforcement agencies use written waiver forms. These include questions designed to establish that the suspect expressly waived their rights. Typical waiver questions are\n* \"Do you understand each of these rights?\" \nand\n* \"Understanding each of these rights, do you now wish to speak to the police without a lawyer being present?\"\n\nThe waiver must be \"knowing and intelligent\" and it must be \"voluntary\". These are separate requirements. To satisfy the first requirement the state must show that the suspect generally understood their rights (right to remain silent and right to counsel) and the consequences of forgoing those rights (that anything they said could be used against them in court). To show that the waiver was \"voluntary\" the state must show that the decision to waive the rights was not the product of police coercion. If police coercion is shown or evident, then the court proceeds to determine the voluntariness of the waiver under the [[totality of the circumstances|totality of circumstances]] test focusing on the personal characteristics of the accused and the particulars of the coercive nature of the police conduct. The ultimate issue is whether the coercive police conduct was sufficient to overcome the will of a person under the totality of the circumstances. As noted previously, courts traditionally focused on two categories of factors in making this determination: (1) the personal characteristics of the suspect and (2) the circumstances attendant to the waiver. However, the Supreme Court significantly altered the voluntariness standard in the case of ''[[Colorado v. Connelly]]''.<ref>479 U.S. 157 (1987)</ref> In ''Connelly'', the Court held that \"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<ref>479 U.S. at 166.</ref> The Court has applied this same standard of voluntariness in determining whether a waiver of a suspect's Fifth Amendment Miranda rights was voluntary. Thus, a waiver of Miranda rights is voluntary unless the defendant can show that their decision to waive their rights and speak to the police was the product of [[police misconduct]] and coercion that overcame the defendant's free will. After ''Connelly'', the traditional totality of circumstances analysis is not even reached unless the defendant can first show such coercion by the police.<ref>Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure 2nd ed. (Little Brown 1986) 250.</ref> Under ''Connelly'', a suspect's decisions need not be the product of rational deliberations.<ref>''[[Moran v. Burbine]]'', 475 U.S.</ref> In addition to showing that the waiver was \"voluntary\", the prosecution must also show that the waiver was \"knowing\" and \"intelligent\". Essentially this means the prosecution must prove that the suspect had a basic understanding of their rights and an appreciation of the consequences of forgoing those rights. The focus of the analysis is directly on the personal characteristics of the suspect. If the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or suffered from an emotional or mental condition that substantially impaired their capacity to make rational decisions, the courts may well decide that the suspect's waiver was not knowing and intelligent.\n\nA waiver must also be clear and unequivocal. An equivocal statement is ineffective as a waiver and the police may not proceed with the interrogation until the suspect's intentions are made clear. The requirement that a waiver be unequivocal must be distinguished from situations in which the suspect made an equivocal assertion of their Miranda rights after the interrogation began. Any post-waiver assertion of a suspect's Miranda rights must be clear and unequivocal.<ref>''[[Davis v. United States (1994)|Davis v. United States]]'', 512 U.S. 452 (1994)</ref> Any ambiguity or equivocation will be ineffective. If the suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the interrogating officers are permitted to ask questions to clarify the suspect's intentions, although they are not required to.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\">''Davis v. United States'' (1994)</ref> In other words, if a suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the police may either attempt to clarify the suspect's intentions or they may simply ignore the ineffective assertion and continue with the interrogation.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\"/> The timing of the assertion is significant. Requesting an attorney prior to arrest is of no consequence because ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations. The police may simply ignore the request and continue with the questioning; however, the suspect is also free to leave.\n\n==Assertion==\nIf the defendant asserts his right to remain silent all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless they have \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's assertion and subsequently obtained a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation.<ref>\"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear: if the individual indicates, in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody.\" ''Michigan v. Moseley'', 423 U.S. 96 (1975) quoting ''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U. S. 436 (1966) at 384 U.S. 473\u201374. Note the defendant's assertion of their fifth amendment [[right to silence]] cannot be used as substantive evidence of guilt, or to impeach the defendant's testimony. (''Doyle v. Ohio'')</ref> In determining whether the police \"scrupulously honored\" the assertion the courts apply a totality of the circumstances test. The most important factors are the length of time between termination of the original interrogation and the commencement of the second, and issuing a new set of Miranda warnings before resumption of interrogation.\n\nThe consequences of assertion of Sixth Amendment right to counsel are stricter.<ref>A request to speak to a third person who is not an attorney does not invoke right to counsel. ''Fare v. Michael C.'', 442 U.S. 707 (1979)</ref> The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present (merely consulting with counsel is insufficient) or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police.<ref>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear ''Maryland v. Shatzer'' to determine how long the protections afforded by the Edwards rule last. [http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2009/01/tackling-edwards-v-arizona-one.html Tackling ''Edwards v. Arizona'' One More Time]</ref> If the defendant does reinitiate contact, a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume.\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court declared in a 5\u20134 decision that criminal defendants who have been read their ''Miranda'' rights (and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them), must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self-incrimination to apply. If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the Miranda right to remain silent, or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention, the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they do not want to speak to police. Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case. This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion, which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent, saying: \"Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.\" Thus, having been \"Mirandized\", a suspect may avow explicitly the invocation of these rights, or, alternatively, simply remain silent. Absent the former, \"anything [said] can and will be used against [the defendant] in a court of law\".\n\n==Exceptions==\nAssuming that the six factors are present, the Miranda rule would apply unless the prosecution can establish that the statement falls within an exception to the Miranda rule.<ref>The statement of the defendant is admissible when offered by the state as substantive evidence of guilt as an admission of a party opponent. This exception or exemption from the hearsay rules is not available to the defendant\u2014the defendant must resort to some other exception if he attempts to offer his own statement into evidence. Further if the defendant is successful in offering his own statement as substantive evidence, then the defendant is the hearsay declarant and the state can impeach the defendant as it would any other witness including the use of potentially devastating evidence of prior convictions.</ref> The three exceptions are:\n\n# the routine booking question exception<ref>See ''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n# the jail house informant exception\n# the public safety exception.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984)</ref>\n\nArguably only the last is a true exception\u2014the first two can better be viewed as consistent with the ''Miranda'' factors. For example, questions that are routinely asked as part of the administrative process of arrest and custodial commitment are not considered \"interrogation\" under Miranda because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses. Nonetheless, all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule. The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state-agent; either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate, a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information.<ref>See ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990)</ref>\n\n===Public safety exception===\nThe \"public safety\" exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without Miranda warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety; thus, the ''Miranda'' rule provides some elasticity.<ref name=\"Stigall, Dan E. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Stigall|first=Dan E.|title=Counterterrorism and the Comparative Law of Investigative Detention|publisher=Cambria|year=2009|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-60497-618-2}}</ref>\n\nThe public safety exception derives from ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'' (1984), a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \"The gun is over there\". The Supreme Court found that such an unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because \"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on ''[[:wikt:post hoc|post hoc]]'' findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer\".<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984).</ref> Thus, the jurisprudential rule of ''Miranda'' must yield in \"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda\".\n\nUnder this exception, to be admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist\", and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety\".<ref>Benoit, Carl A.

Massiah]]'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964).</ref> The public safety exception applies where circumstances present a clear and present danger to the public's safety and the officers have reason to believe that the suspect has information that can end the emergency.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984).</ref>\n\n==Consequences of violation==\nAssuming that a Miranda violation occurred\u2014the six factors are present and no exception applies\u2014the statement will be subject to suppression under the Miranda exclusionary rule.<ref>A common misconception is that a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights warrants dismissal of the charges. Generally, a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights will not result in dismissal of the charges unless the defendant can show that the violation was especially egregious.</ref> That is, if the defendant objects or files a motion to suppress, the exclusionary rule would prohibit the prosecution from offering the statement as proof of guilt. However, the statement can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>The statement must be \"voluntary\" under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. An involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref> Further, the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] doctrine does not apply to Miranda violations.<ref>Note that if the seizure of the defendant violated the fourth amendment any confession that resulted from the seizure would be subject to suppression. For example, an officer stops a defendant because the officer has a \"gut feeling\" that the defendant is driving while impaired. After the stop the officer asks the defendant if he had been drinking and the defendant says: \"Yes\". The officer then arrests the defendant and takes him to the law enforcement center to administer a breathalyzer test. While in the breathalyzer room the officer asks the defendant the questions on his alcohol influence report. The defendant's responses are incriminating. Under this scenario because the initial stop was unconstitutional all evidence that resulted from the stop would be subject to suppression.</ref> Therefore, the exclusionary rule exceptions, attenuation, independent source and inevitable discovery, do not come into play, and derivative evidence would be fully admissible. For example, suppose the police continue with a custodial interrogation after the suspect has asserted his right to silence. During his post-assertion statement the suspect tells the police the location of the gun he used in the murder. Using this information the police find the gun. Forensic testing identifies the gun as the murder weapon, and fingerprints lifted from the gun match the suspect's. The contents of the Miranda-defective statement could not be offered by the prosecution as substantive evidence, but the gun itself and all related forensic evidence could be used as evidence at trial.\n\n===Procedural requirements===\nAlthough the rules vary by jurisdiction, generally a person who wishes to contest the admissibility of evidence<ref>Evidence includes physical evidence, confessions and identification evidence.

Failure to assert a ground may be treated as waiver. The defendant must also assert facts that show that a substantial claim exists. The assertion must be specific, detailed, definite and nonconjectural. Adams & Blinka, ''Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions'', 2nd ed. (Lexis 1998) at 7. citing ''United States v.

United States]]'') prohibits the admission of a confession obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Specifically, the Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed. The events that trigger the Sixth Amendment safeguards under ''Massiah'' are (1) the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and (2) deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial and to assure that the adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the \"prosecutorial forces\" of the state.\n\n====Commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings====\nThe Sixth Amendment right \"attaches\" once the government has committed itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings \"by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment\".<ref>''United States v. Gouveia'', 467 U.S. 180, 187\u201388, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2297, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984). \"In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court's landmark opinion in ''Powell v. Alabama'', 287 U.S. 45, it has been firmly established that a person's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him. See ''Powell v. Alabama'', supra; ''Johnson v. Zerbst'', 304 U.S. 458; ''Hamilton v. Alabama'', 368 U.S. 52; ''Gideon v. Wainwright'', 372 U.S. 335; ''White v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 59; ''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201; ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218; ''Gilbert v. California'', 388 U.S. 263; ''Coleman v. Alabama'', 399 U.S. 1.\" \"... [W]hile members of the Court have differed as to the existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"</ref> Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Courts cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins.<ref>''Michigan v. Jackson'', 475 U.S. 625, 632 (1986); see also ''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1977). In ''Maine v. Moulton'' the court stated \"By its very terms, it becomes applicable only when the government's role shifts from investigation to accusation. For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the intricacies ... of law,\" ibid., is needed to assure that the prosecution's case encounters \"the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing\". The Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until such time as the \"government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified ...'\" ''Kirby v. Illinois'', 406 U. S. 689 (1972).</ref> Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation. A critical stage is \"any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial\".<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218, 226, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1932, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); see also, ''United States v. Hidalgo'', 7 F.3d 1566 (11th Cir. 1993). Under the critical stage analysis, virtually every phase of the criminal trial is a critical stage. Additionally courts have generally held that pretrial hearings regarding conditions of pretrial release and suppression of evidence are considered critical stages. ''Smith v. Lockhart'', 923 F.2d 1314 (8th Cir. 1991) on the other hand courts have generally held that certain pre-trial post accusation investigative procedures are not critical stages. Analysis of fingerprints, blood samples, clothing, hair, handwriting, and voice samples have all been ruled to be noncritical stages. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, (2001)</ref>\n\nGovernment attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 97 S. Ct. 1232 (1977) \"That the incriminating statements were elicited surreptitiously in the ''Massiah'' case, and otherwise here, is constitutionally irrelevant. See ibid.; ''McLeod v. Ohio'', 381 U. S. 356; ''United States v. Crisp'', 435 F.2d 354, 358 (CA7)\"</ref>\n\n====Deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents====\nDeliberate elicitation is defined as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely to produce incriminating information from the defendant.<ref>''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990).</ref> Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants.<ref>''Massiah'' does not prohibit the government's use of a cellmate as a \"silent listening post\"\u2014a person who is simply placed in a position to hear any incriminating statements the defendant might make about the charged offense but who does not do anything to coax or induce the defendant to talk about the charged crime. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436 (1986).</ref>\n\nThe definition of \"deliberate elicitation\" is not the same as the definition of \"interrogation\" under the Miranda rule. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific&nbsp;\u2013 the right only applies to post-commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged.<ref>''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 111 S. Ct. 2204 (1991). Lower federal courts has extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to factually related offenses. In Texas v. Cobb, the Supreme Court made clear that the right to counsel applied only to the crime charged and did not apply to attempts to gather information about \"other offenses 'closely related factually' to the charged offense\". ''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref> The right does not extend to uncharged offenses if factually related to the charged crime.<ref>''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref>\n\nAs noted, information obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel. The waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387 (1977)</ref> A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right.\n\n====Miranda and Massiah compared====\n# ''' Constitutional basis''':\n#* Miranda is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n#* Massiah is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n# '''Attachment''':\n#* Miranda: Custody + interrogation (charging status irrelevant).\n#* Massiah: Formally charged + deliberate elicitation (custodial status irrelevant).\n# '''Scope''':\n#*a. Miranda applies to custodial interrogation by known governmental agents. Surreptitious acquisition of incriminating information allowed.\n#*a. Massiah applies to overt and surreptitious interrogation.\n#*b. Miranda is not offense specific.<ref>''Mathis v. United States'', 391 U.S. 1 (1968)</ref>\n#*b. Massiah is offense specific.<ref>See ''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 501 U.S. 171 (1991)</ref>\n#*c. Miranda: interrogation + \"functional equivalent\"\n#*c. Massiah: interrogation + \"deliberate elicitation\"\n# '''Waiver''': Both Miranda and Massiah rights may be waived.\n# '''Assertion''': In each case, the assertion must be clear and unequivocal. The effects of assertion are not identical. For purposes of Miranda, the police must immediately cease the interrogation and cannot resume interrogating the defendant about any offense charged or uncharged unless counsel is present or defendant initiates contact for purposes of resuming interrogation and valid waiver obtained. Because Massiah is offense-specific, an assertion of the sixth amendment right to counsel requires the police to cease interrogating the defendant about any charged offense. Apparently the police could continue questioning the defendant about uncharged crimes assuming that the defendant was not in custody. The defendant's remedy would be to leave or to refuse to answer questions.<ref>Under ''Michigan v. Jackson'', a defendant's request for counsel at a preliminary hearing constituted an assertion of his sixth amendment right to counsel. However, ''Michigan v. Jackson'' was overruled by ''Montejo v. Louisiana .''</ref>\n# '''Remedy for violation''': The remedy for violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel is identical: the statements and testimonial information are subject to suppression. Derivative evidence is not subject to suppression under Miranda&nbsp;\u2013 fruit of poisonous tree doctrine may apply to Massiah violation.<ref>''Fellers v. United States'', 124 S.Ct. 1019 (2004)</ref> Both Miranda and Massiah defective statements can be used for impeachment purposes.\n# '''Exceptions''': The primary exceptions to Miranda are (1) the routine booking questions exception (2) the jail house informant exception and (3) the public safety exception. In ''Moulton v. Maine'' the Supreme Court refused to recognize a public safety exception to the Massiah rule.<ref>474 U.S. 159 (1989)</ref> Massiah allows for the use of jail house informants provided the informants serve merely as \"passive listeners\".<ref>The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide another basis for challenging the admissibility of confessions. The test is whether the statement was \"voluntary\". A statement is not voluntary if it was the product of police misconduct. That is a due process claim requires that the defendant establish that there was police misconduct and that this misconduct induced the confession. The \"voluntariness\" test is implicated in any police interrogation\u2014neither Miranda \"custody\" or Massiah \"commencement of formal criminal proceedings\" is a necessary conditions (state action is required). Further, there are no issues of waiver or assertion. Finally the remedy is complete\u2014an involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref>\n\n===The voluntariness standard===\nThe voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and regardless of whether the suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>Originally Miranda was regarded as a \"prophylactic\" rule\u2014the rule itself was not a constitutional right but a \" judicially\u2013created enforcement mechanism\" devised to protect the underlying constitutional rights. In Dickerson v. United States, the Court \"constitutionalized\" the Miranda rule\u2014although the decision did not perforce change the rule concerning the use of a Miranda-defective statement for impeachment purposes.</ref> The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in ''Colorado v. Connelly''.<ref>''Colorado v. Connelly'', 479 U.S. 157 (1986)</ref> Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances.<ref>See ''Mincey v. Arizona'', 437 U.S. 385 (1978); ''Greenwald v. Wisconsin'', 390 U. S. 519, 390 U.S. 521 (1968) (\"Considering the totality of these circumstances, we do not think it credible that petitioner's statements were the product of his free and rational choice\"); Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 367 U.S. 440 (1961) (\"If [a defendant's will was overborne], the confession cannot be deemed 'the product of a rational intellect and a free will'\")</ref> \"Voluntary\" carried its everyday meaning: the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion.<ref>See e.g., ''Culombe v. Connecticut'', 367 U.S. 568, 367 U.S. 583 (1961) (\"[A]n extrajudicial confession, if it was to be offered in evidence against a man, must be the product of his own free choice\")</ref> After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996) at 247.</ref> Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996)</ref>\n\n===State constitutional challenges===\nEvery state constitution has articles and provision guaranteeing individual rights.<ref>Latzer, ''State Constitutions and Criminal Justice'' (Greenwood 1991)</ref> In most cases the subject matter is similar to the federal bill of rights.<ref>Id. at 2. This similarity is hardly surprising since the federal constitution and many state constitutions had common sources the state constitutions of some of the more important states such as Virginia.</ref> Most state courts interpretation of their constitution is consistent with the interpretation federal court's of analogous provisions of the federal constitution. With regard to Miranda issues, state courts have exhibited significant resistance to incorporating into their state jurisprudence some of the limitations on the Miranda rule that have been created by the federal courts.<ref>Id. at 89\u201391.</ref> As a consequence a defendant may be able to circumvent the federal limitation on the Miranda rule and successfully challenge the admissibility under state constitutional provisions. Practically every aspect of the Miranda rule has drawn state court criticism. However the primary point of contention involve the following limitations on the scope of the Miranda rule: (1) the Harris exception<ref>In ''Harris'' the United States Supreme Court allowed a Miranda-defective statement to be used to impeach the trial testimony of a defendant. Note the Harris rule does not permit the use of a statement that fails to meet the voluntariness standards of the due process clause to be used for any purpose. The basis for the distinction is that a Miranda-defective statement does not raise the questions of unreliability as does an involuntary statement.</ref> (2) the Burbine rule<ref>In ''Moran v. Burbine'', 475 U.S. 412 (1986) the Court held that officers are not required to tell a suspect in custody that third parties had retained an attorney for the suspect. The failure of the police to inform the suspect of this fact did not render the waiver involuntary. ''Burbine'' decision was not well-received by the state courts. Six states specifically rejected the Burbine rule.</ref> and (3) the Fare rule.<ref>id. at 91\u201398. The specific holding in Fare was that a juvenile's request to have his probation officer present during an interrogation was not an invocation of the juvenile's right to counsel. The Supreme Court stated that juveniles were essentially to be treated the same as adults for the purposes of Miranda. Many states adopted special rules concerning police interrogation of juveniles not true</ref>\n\n===State statutory challenges===\nIn addition to constitutionally based challenge, states permit a defendant to challenge the admissibility of a confession on the grounds that the confession was obtained in violation of a defendant's statutory rights. For example, North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act permits a defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a \"substantial\" violation of the provision of the North Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n==Confusion regarding use==\nDue to the prevalence of American television programs and motion pictures in which the police characters frequently read suspects their rights, it has become an expected element of arrest procedure\u2014in the 2000 ''Dickerson'' decision, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] wrote that Miranda warnings had \"become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\".<ref>''[[Dickerson v. United States]]'' {{ussc|530|428|2000}}.</ref>\n\nWhile arrests and interrogations can legally occur without the Miranda warning being given, this procedure would generally make the arrestee's pre-Miranda statements inadmissible at trial. (However, pursuant to the plurality opinion in ''[[United States v. Patane]]'', physical evidence obtained as a result of pre-Miranda statements may still be admitted. There was no majority opinion of the Court in that case.)\n\nIn some jurisdictions,{{where|date=July 2011}} a ''detention'' differs at law from an ''arrest'', and police are not required to give the Miranda warning until the person is arrested for a crime. In those situations, a person's statements made to police are generally admissible even though the person was not advised of their rights. Similarly, statements made while an arrest is in progress before the Miranda warning was given or completed are also generally admissible.\n\nBecause ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations, it does not protect detainees from standard booking questions such as name and address. Because it is a protective measure intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, it does not prevent the police from taking blood without a warrant from persons suspected of [[Drunk driving (United States)|driving under the influence of alcohol]]. (Such evidence may be self-incriminatory, but are not considered statements of self-incrimination.)\n\nIf an inmate is in jail and invoked ''Miranda'' on one case, it is unclear whether this extends to any other cases that they may be charged with while in custody. For example: a subject is arrested, charged with cattle rustling, and is held in county jail awaiting trial. He invoked his Miranda rights on the cow case. While in custody, he is involved in a fight where a staff member loses his ability to walk. He speaks to the custodial staff regarding the fight without staff first invoking Miranda. It is unclear if this statement is admissible because of the original Miranda statement.\n\nMany police departments give special training to interrogators with regard to the Miranda warning; specifically, how to influence a suspect's decision to waive the right. For instance, the officer may be required to specifically ask if the rights are understood and if the suspect wishes to talk. The officer is allowed, before asking the suspect a question, to speak at length about evidence collected, witness statements, etc. The officer will ''then'' ask if the suspect wishes to talk, and the suspect is then more likely to talk in an attempt to refute the evidence presented. Another tactic commonly taught is never to ask a question; the officer may simply sit the suspect down in an interrogation room, sit across from him and do paperwork, and wait for the suspect to begin talking.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724033316/http://www.regent.edu/admin/media/schlaw/LawPreview/ Prof. James Duane and Officer George Bruch \u2013 Fifth Amendment Lecture at Regent University].</ref> These tactics are intended to mitigate the restrictions placed on law officers against compelling a suspect to give evidence, and have stood up in court as valid lawful tactics. Nevertheless, such tactics are condemned by legal rights groups as deceptive.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Exemption for interrogations conducted by undercover agents===\nIn [[Illinois v. Perkins]], 496 U.S. 292 (1990), the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that undercover officers do not have to give suspects a ''Miranda'' warning prior to asking questions that may elicit incriminating responses. In this case, an undercover agent posed as an inmate and carried on a 35-minute conversation with another inmate that he suspected of committing a murder that was being investigated. During this conversation, the suspect implicated himself in the murder that the undercover agent was investigating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/496/292 |title=Supreme.justia.com |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court came to this conclusion despite the government's admission that a custodial interrogation had been conducted by a government agent.\n\n===Report of warnings being given to detainees in Afghanistan===\nBeginning in 2009, some detainees captured in [[Afghanistan]] have been read their Miranda rights by the [[FBI]], according to Congressman [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Michael Rogers]] of Michigan, who claims to have witnessed this himself.

These rights are often referred to as '''''Miranda''''' '''rights'''. The purpose of such notification is to preserve the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility of their statements]] made during custodial interrogation in later criminal proceedings.\n\nThe language used in a ''Miranda'' warning is derived from the 1966 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 US 436 (1966).<ref name=Miranda>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1965/759|title=Miranda v.

In ''Miranda v. Arizona'', the Supreme Court held that the [[admissible evidence|admission]] of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment right to counsel]], through the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] of these rights into state law.{{#tag:ref|The 2004 United States Supreme Court ruling ''[[Hiibel v.

Arizona]]'' Supreme Court decision, which found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of [[Ernesto Miranda|Ernesto Arturo Miranda]] had been violated during his arrest and trial for armed robbery, kidnapping, and rape of a mentally handicapped young woman. \n\nMiranda was subsequently retried and convicted, based primarily on his estranged ex-partner, who had been tracked down by the original arresting officer via Miranda's own parents, suddenly claiming that Miranda had confessed to her when she had visited him in jail; Miranda's lawyer later confessed that he 'goofed' the trial.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S5y-y-0qpa4C&pg=PA262&dq=goofed#v=onepage&q=goofed&f=false|title=The Devil's Advocates: Greatest Closing Arguments in Criminal Law|last=Lief|first=Michael S.|last2=Caldwell|first2=H. Mitchell|date=2006-08-29|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743246682|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda rights, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The Supreme Court did not specify the exact wording to use when informing a suspect of their rights. However, the Court did create a set of guidelines that must be followed. The ruling states:\n\n{{quote|...The person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he/she has the [[right to silence|right to remain silent]], and that anything the person says will be used against that person in court; the person must be clearly informed that he/she has the right to consult with an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning, and that, if he/she is [[poverty|indigent]], an attorney will be provided at no cost to represent him/her.}}\n\nIn ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'' (1984), the Supreme Court decided that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in ''Miranda'', regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which they are suspected or for which they were arrested.<ref>''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, [[American English]] developed the [[verb]] ''Mirandize'', meaning \"read the ''Miranda'' rights to\" a suspect (when the suspect is arrested).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title=Mirandize |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mirandize |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>\n\nNotably, the ''Miranda'' rights do not have to be read in any particular order, and they do not have to precisely match the language of the ''Miranda'' case as long as they are adequately and fully conveyed (''[[California v. Prysock]]'', {{ussc|453|355|1981}}<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/355/ ''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355 (1981)].</ref>).\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court held that unless a suspect expressly states that they are invoking this right, subsequent voluntary statements made to an officer can be used against them in court, and police can continue to interact with (or question) the alleged criminal.\n\n==The warnings==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nEvery U.S. jurisdiction has its own regulations regarding what, precisely, must be said to a person arrested or placed in a custodial situation. The typical warning states:<ref>{{cite news|title=Typical reading of Miranda rights|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/29/loc_typical_reading_of.html|date=August 29, 2001}}</ref>\n* You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.\n* Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.\n* You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.\n* If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.\n* If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.\n* Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?\n\nThe courts have since ruled that the warning must be \"meaningful\", so it is usually required that the suspect be asked if they understand their rights. Sometimes, firm answers of \"yes\" are required. Some departments and jurisdictions require that an officer ask \"do you understand?\" after every sentence in the warning. An arrestee's silence is not a waiver, but on June 1, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that police are allowed to interrogate suspects who have invoked or waived their rights ambiguously, and any statement given during questioning prior to invocation or waiving is admissible as evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704875604575280392747737022|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Jess|last=Bravin|title=Justices Narrow Miranda Rule|date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> Evidence has in some cases been ruled inadmissible because of an arrestee's poor knowledge of English and the failure of arresting officers to provide the warning in the arrestee's language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Einesman |first=Floralynn |title=Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of ''Miranda'' and Diversity |journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]] |year=1999 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201348 [p. 41] |jstor=1144162 |id={{NCJ|182327}} |doi=10.2307/1144162 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol90/iss1/1 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the exact language above is not required by ''Miranda'', the police must advise the suspect that:\n# they have the right to remain silent;\n# anything the suspect ''does'' say can and may be used against them in a court of law;\n# they have the right to have an attorney present before and during the questioning; and\n# they have the right, if they cannot afford the services of an attorney, to have one appointed, at public expense and without cost to them, to represent them before and during the questioning.<ref>State and Federal courts have consistently rejected challenges to Miranda warnings on grounds that defendant was not advised of additional rights. See, e.g., ''United States v. Coldwell'', 954 F.2d 496(8th Cir. 1992) For example, police are not required to advise a suspect that if he decides to answer questions without an attorney present, he still has the right to stop answering at any time until he talks to an attorney. Note that the Miranda warnings are not part of the arrest procedure. There is no constitutional requirement that the officer advise the defendant of their Miranda rights when they place the defendant under arrest.</ref>\nThere is no precise language that must be used in advising a suspect of their Miranda rights.<ref>''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355, 101 S. Ct. 2806, 69 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1981); ''Brown v. Crosby'', 249 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (S.D. Fla. 2003).</ref> The point is that whatever language is used the substance of the rights outlined above must be communicated to the suspect.<ref>''Duckworth v. Eagan'', 492 U.S. 195, 109 S. Ct. 2875, 106 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1989) While a \"talismanic incantation\" of the exact language of the original Miranda warnings is not required, [Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure, 5th ed. (Aspen 2006) 268] deviations and omission can result in suppression of the statement.</ref> The suspect may be advised of their rights orally or in writing.<ref>''U.S. v. Labrada-Bustamante'', 428 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir. 2005).</ref> Also, officers must make sure the suspect understands what the officer is saying, taking into account potential education levels. It may be necessary to \"translate\" to the suspect's level of understanding. Courts have ruled this admissible as long as the original waiver is said and the \"translation\" is recorded either on paper or on tape.\n\nThe Supreme Court has resisted efforts to require officers to more fully advise suspects of their rights. For example, the police are not required to advise the suspect that they can stop the interrogation at any time, that the decision to exercise the right cannot be used against the suspect, or that they have a right to talk to a lawyer before being asked any questions. Nor have the courts required to explain the rights. For example, the standard Miranda right to counsel states ''You have a right to have an attorney present during the questioning''. Police are not required to explain that this right is not merely a right to have a lawyer present while the suspect is being questioned. The right to counsel includes:\n* the right to talk to a lawyer before deciding whether to talk to police,\n* if the defendant decides to talk to the police, the right to consult with a lawyer before being interrogated,\n* the right to answer police only through an attorney.<ref>Gregory Declue, [http://www.aele.org/law/2009-08MLJ501.html Oral Miranda warnings: A checklist and a model presentation], ''The Journal of Psychiatry & Law'' (2007) at 421.</ref>\n\n===Circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' requisites===\nThe circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' safeguards, i.e. Miranda warnings, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Suspects in \"custody\" who are about to be interrogated must be properly advised of their Miranda rights\u2014namely, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination (and, in furtherance of this right, the right to counsel while in custody). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and have an attorney present during the interrogation. The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination is the right to remain silent\u2014the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information.\n\nThe duty to warn only arises when police officers conduct custodial interrogations. The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure, or once an officer has probable cause to arrest, or if the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation. Custody and interrogation are the events that trigger the duty to warn.\n\n===Use in various U.S. state jurisdictions===\n[[File:Fugitive felon life magazine.jpg|thumb|Police detectives read the Miranda rights to a fugitive felon, 1984 (photography: J.

If the suspect responds \"no\" to the first question, the officer is required to re-read the Miranda warning, while saying \"no\" to the second question invokes the right at that moment; in either case the interviewing officer or officers cannot question the suspect until the rights are waived.\n\nGenerally, when defendants invoke their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify or submit to cross-examination at trial, the prosecutor cannot indirectly punish them for the exercise of a constitutional right by commenting on their silence and insinuating that it is an implicit admission of guilt.<ref>''[[Griffin v. California]]'', {{ussc|380|609|1965}}.</ref> Since ''Miranda'' rights are simply a judicial gloss upon the Fifth Amendment which protects against coercive interrogations, the same rule also prevents prosecutors from commenting about the post-arrest silence of suspects who invoke their ''Miranda'' rights immediately after arrest.<ref>''[[Wainwright v. Greenfield]]'', {{ussc|474|284|1986}}.</ref> However, neither the Fifth Amendment nor ''Miranda'' extend to ''pre-arrest'' silence, which means that if a defendant takes the witness stand at trial (meaning he just waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent), the prosecutor can attack his credibility with his pre-arrest silence (based on his failure to immediately turn himself in and confess to the things he voluntarily testified about at trial).<ref>''[[Jenkins v. Anderson]]'', {{ussc|447|231|1980}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], Article 31<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/831- Article 31].</ref> provides for the right against compelled self-incrimination.

The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps require that all arrested personnel be read the \"rights of the accused\" and must sign a form waiving those rights if they so desire; a verbal waiver is not sufficient.\n\nIt has been discussed{{by whom|date=November 2010}} whether a Miranda warning\u2014if spoken or in writing\u2014could be appropriately given to [[disability|disabled persons]]. For example, \"the right to remain silent\" means little to a [[deaf]] individual and the word \"constitutional\" may not be understood by people with only an elementary education. In one case, a deaf murder suspect was kept at a therapy station until he was able to understand the meaning of the Miranda warning and other judicial proceedings.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Deaf Murderers: Clinical and Forensic Issues |journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=495\u2013516 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0798(199910/12)17:4<495::AID-BSL361>3.0.CO;2-6 |first1=McCay |last1=Vernon |first2=Annie G. |last2=Steinberg |first3=Louise A. |last3=Montoya}}</ref>\n\n==The six rules==\nThe Miranda rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings that is the product of custodial police interrogation. The Miranda right to counsel and right to remain silent are derived from the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>The Miranda rule is not an element of a valid arrest. The Fifth Amendment does not require an officer to give an arrestee his Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure. The Miranda rights are triggered by custody and interrogation. At the time the Supreme Court decided Miranda the Fifth Amendment had already been applied to the states in ''Malloy v. Hogan'', 378 U.S. 1 (1964)</ref> Therefore, for Miranda to apply, six requirements must be fulfilled:\n\n; 1. Evidence must have been gathered.\n: If the suspect did not make a statement during the interrogation the fact that he was not advised of his Miranda rights is of no importance.<ref>Note that post warning silence cannot be used as evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's trial testimony. ''Doyle v. Ohio'', 426 U.S. 610 (1976).</ref> Nor can the state offer evidence that the defendant asserted his rights\u2014that he refused to talk.\n; 2. The evidence must be testimonial.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\">''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n: Miranda applies only to \"testimonial\" evidence as that term is defined under the Fifth Amendment.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\"/> For purposes of the Fifth Amendment, testimonial statements mean communications that explicitly or implicitly relate a factual assertion [an assertion of fact or belief] or disclose information.<ref>''Doe v. United States'', 487 U.S. 201 (1988).</ref><ref>See also ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218 (1967).</ref> The Miranda rule does not prohibit compelling a person to engage in non-assertive conduct that is incriminating or may produce incriminating evidence. Thus, requiring a suspect to participate in identification procedures such as giving [[handwriting exemplar|handwriting]]<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis)331 n. 203 citing ''United States v. Daughenbaugh'', 49 F.3d 171, 173 (5th Cir. 1995).</ref> or voice exemplars,<ref>''United States v. Mitchell'', 556 F.2d 382 (6th Cir. 1977).</ref> fingerprints, DNA samples, hair samples, and dental impressions is not within the Miranda rule. Such physical or real evidence is non-testimonial and not protected by the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause.<ref>''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S 582 (1990).</ref> On the other hand, certain non-verbal conduct may be testimonial. For example, if the suspect nodded their head up and down in response to the question \"did you kill the victim\", the conduct is testimonial, is the same as saying \"yes I did\", and Miranda would apply.<ref>See ''Schmerber v. California'', 384 U.S. 757, 761 n. 5 (1966).</ref>\n; 3. The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody.<ref>''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody. This limitation follows from the fact that Miranda's purpose is to protect suspects from the compulsion inherent in the police-dominated atmosphere attendant to arrest. Custody means either that the suspect was under arrest or that his freedom of movement was restrained to an extent \"associated with a formal arrest\".<ref>''[[Stansbury v. California]]'', 114 S. Ct. 1526 (1994); ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984). Some courts phrased the requirement as the defendant did not believe that he was \"free to leave\". This standard is comparable to the detention standard for purposes of the fourth amendment\u2014not the functional arrest standard for purposes of the fifth amendment.<!-- Unable to verify 'detention standard' annotation in cited cases. --></ref> A formal arrest occurs when an officer, with the intent to make an arrest, takes a person into custody by the use of physical force or the person submits to the control of an officer who has indicated his intention to arrest the person. Telling a person he is \"under arrest\" is sufficient to satisfy this requirement even though the person may not be otherwise physically restrained.<ref>Adams & Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (LEXIS 1998) at 306.</ref> Absent a formal arrest, the issue is whether a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have believed that he was under \"full custodial\" arrest.<ref>In deciding whether a person is in \"constructive custody\" the courts use a totality of the circumstances test. Factors frequently examined include\n# the location of the interrogation\n# the force used to stop or detain the suspect\n# the number officer and police vehicles involved\n# whether the officers were in uniform\n# whether the officers were visibly armed\n# the tone of officer's voice\n# whether the suspect was told they were free to leave\n# the length of the detention and/or interrogation\n# whether the suspect was confronted with incriminating evidence and\n# whether the accused was the focus of the investigation.</ref> Applying this objective test, the Court has held Miranda does not apply to roadside questioning of a stopped motorist or to questioning of a person briefly detained on the street\u2014a [[Terry stop]].<ref>See ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984) (brief roadside investigatory detention is not custody) and ''California v. Beheler'', 463 U.S. 1121 (1983) (''per curiam'').</ref> Even though neither the motorist nor the pedestrian is free to leave, this interference with the freedom of action is not considered actual arrest or its functional equivalent for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984).</ref> The court has similarly held that a person who voluntarily comes to the police station for purposes of questioning is not in custody and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings particularly when the police advise the suspect that he is not under arrest and free to leave.<ref>Miranda is not offense or investigation-specific. Therefore, absent a valid waiver, a person in custody cannot be interrogated about the offense they are held in custody for, or any other offense.</ref>\n; 4. The evidence must have been the product of interrogation.<ref>''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', 446 U.S. 291 (1980)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been the product of interrogation. A defendant who seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement under Miranda must show that the statement was \"prompted by police conduct that constituted 'interrogation'\".<ref>Imwinkelried and Blinka, Criminal Evidentiary Foundations, 2d ed. (Lexis 2007) {{ISBN|1-4224-1741-7}} at 620.</ref> A volunteered statement by a person in custody does not implicate Miranda. In ''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', the Supreme Court defined interrogation as express questioning and \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect\". Thus, a practice that the police \"should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect ... amounts to interrogation\". For example, confronting the suspect with incriminating evidence may be sufficiently evocative to amount to interrogation because the police are implicitly communicating a question: \"How do you explain this?\"<ref>See ''[[Edwards v. Arizona]]'', 451 U.S. 477 (1981).</ref> On the other hand, \"unforeseeable results of police words or actions\" do not constitute interrogation. Under this definition, routine statements made during the administration of sobriety tests would not implicate Miranda. For example, a police officer arrests a person for impaired driving and takes him to the police station to administer an intoxilyzer test. While at the station the officer also asks the defendant to perform certain psycho-physical tests such as the walk and turn, one leg stand or finger to nose test. It is standard practice to instruct the arrestee on how to perform the test and to demonstrate the test. (Note that the police ''will not'' tell the person that they have the right to refuse to perform the test, and the refusal cannot be used in evidence against them, nor can they be in any way punished for refusing to perform it, same as the police will not tell someone that they may refuse to perform a roadside sobriety test without penalty). An incriminating statement made by an arrestee during the instruction, \"I couldn't do that even if I was sober\", would not be the product of interrogation. Similarly, incriminating statements made in response to requests for consent to search a vehicle or other property are not considered to be the product of interrogation.<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis 1998)331 n. 204 citing United States v. Smith, 3 F.3d. 1088 (7th Cir. 1993)</ref>\n; 5. The interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', 378 U.S. 478 (1964); ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 110 S. Ct. 2394 (1990). See also Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, (Greenwood Press 1991), citing ''Walter v. United States'', 447 U.S. 649 (1980)</ref>\n: To establish a violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, the defendant must show state action, so the interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>See Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, 97 n. 86 (Goodwood Press 1991) quoting Kamisar, LaFave & Israel, Basic Criminal Procedure 598 (6th ed. 1986) \"whatever may lurk in the heart or mind of the fellow prisoner ..., if it is not 'custodial police interrogation' ''in the eye of the beholder'', then it is not ... interrogation within the meaning of Miranda\".</ref> If the interrogation was conducted by a person known by the suspect to be a law enforcement officer the state action requirement is unquestionably met. On the other hand, where a private citizen obtains a statement there is no state action regardless of the custodial circumstances surrounding the statement. A confession obtained through the interrogation by an undercover police officer or a paid informant does not violate ''Miranda'' because there is no coercion, no police dominated atmosphere if the suspect does not know that they are being questioned by the police. Private security guards and \"private\" police present special problems. They are generally not regarded as state-agents. However, an interrogation conducted by a police officer moonlighting as a security guard may well trigger Miranda's safeguards since an officer is considered to be \"on duty\" at all times.<ref>See ''Commonwealth v. Leone'', 386 Mass. 329 (1982).</ref>\n; 6. The evidence must be offered by the state during a criminal prosecution.<ref>The Fifth Amendment applies only to compelled statements used in criminal proceedings</ref>\n: The evidence is being offered during a criminal proceeding. Under the exclusionary rule, a Miranda-defective statement cannot be used by the prosecution as substantive evidence of guilt. However, the Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule applies only to criminal proceedings. In determining whether a particular proceeding is criminal, the courts look at the punitive nature of the sanctions that could be imposed. Labels are irrelevant. The question is whether the consequences of an outcome adverse to the defendant could be characterized as punishment. Clearly a criminal trial is a criminal proceeding since if convicted the defendant could be fined or imprisoned. However, the possibility of loss of liberty does not make the proceeding criminal in nature. For example, commitment proceedings are not criminal proceedings even though they can result in long confinement because the confinement is considered rehabilitative in nature and not punishment. Similarly, ''Miranda'' does not apply directly to probation revocation proceedings because the evidence is not being used as a basis for imposing additional punishment.\n\n===Application of the prerequisites===\nAssuming that the six requirements are present and ''Miranda'' applies, the statement will be subject to suppression unless the prosecution can demonstrate:\n* that the suspect was advised of their ''Miranda'' rights, and\n* that the suspect voluntarily waived those rights or that the circumstances fit an exception to the ''Miranda'' rule.\nThe defendant may also be able to challenge the admissibility of the statement under provisions of state constitutions and state criminal procedure statutes.<ref>Other bases for exclusion include that the confession was the product of an unconstitutional arrest [See Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975); [[Dunaway v. New York]], 442 U.S. 200 (1979)], the confession was obtained in violation of the defendant's sixth amendment right to counsel or the confession was involuntary under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that immigrants who live in the United States illegally are also protected and should receive their Miranda warnings as well when being interrogated or placed under arrest. \"[[Alien (law)|Aliens]] receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and [have] developed substantial connections with this country\".<ref>Einesman, F: \"Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of Miranda and Diversity\", p. 9. ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', 1999.</ref>\n\nThe Fifth Amendment right to counsel, a component of the ''Miranda'' Rule, is different from the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In the context of the law of confessions the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is defined by the [[Massiah v. United States|Massiah]] Doctrine (''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964)).\n\n==Waiver==\nSimply advising the suspect of their rights does not fully comply with the Miranda rule. The suspect must also voluntarily waive their Miranda rights before questioning can proceed.<ref name=Miranda /> An express waiver is not necessary.<ref>''United States v. Melanson'', 691 F.2d 579 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 856 (1981).</ref> However, most law enforcement agencies use written waiver forms. These include questions designed to establish that the suspect expressly waived their rights. Typical waiver questions are\n* \"Do you understand each of these rights?\" \nand\n* \"Understanding each of these rights, do you now wish to speak to the police without a lawyer being present?\"\n\nThe waiver must be \"knowing and intelligent\" and it must be \"voluntary\". These are separate requirements. To satisfy the first requirement the state must show that the suspect generally understood their rights (right to remain silent and right to counsel) and the consequences of forgoing those rights (that anything they said could be used against them in court). To show that the waiver was \"voluntary\" the state must show that the decision to waive the rights was not the product of police coercion. If police coercion is shown or evident, then the court proceeds to determine the voluntariness of the waiver under the [[totality of the circumstances|totality of circumstances]] test focusing on the personal characteristics of the accused and the particulars of the coercive nature of the police conduct. The ultimate issue is whether the coercive police conduct was sufficient to overcome the will of a person under the totality of the circumstances. As noted previously, courts traditionally focused on two categories of factors in making this determination: (1) the personal characteristics of the suspect and (2) the circumstances attendant to the waiver. However, the Supreme Court significantly altered the voluntariness standard in the case of ''[[Colorado v. Connelly]]''.<ref>479 U.S. 157 (1987)</ref> In ''Connelly'', the Court held that \"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<ref>479 U.S. at 166.</ref> The Court has applied this same standard of voluntariness in determining whether a waiver of a suspect's Fifth Amendment Miranda rights was voluntary. Thus, a waiver of Miranda rights is voluntary unless the defendant can show that their decision to waive their rights and speak to the police was the product of [[police misconduct]] and coercion that overcame the defendant's free will. After ''Connelly'', the traditional totality of circumstances analysis is not even reached unless the defendant can first show such coercion by the police.<ref>Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure 2nd ed. (Little Brown 1986) 250.</ref> Under ''Connelly'', a suspect's decisions need not be the product of rational deliberations.<ref>''[[Moran v. Burbine]]'', 475 U.S.</ref> In addition to showing that the waiver was \"voluntary\", the prosecution must also show that the waiver was \"knowing\" and \"intelligent\". Essentially this means the prosecution must prove that the suspect had a basic understanding of their rights and an appreciation of the consequences of forgoing those rights. The focus of the analysis is directly on the personal characteristics of the suspect. If the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or suffered from an emotional or mental condition that substantially impaired their capacity to make rational decisions, the courts may well decide that the suspect's waiver was not knowing and intelligent.\n\nA waiver must also be clear and unequivocal. An equivocal statement is ineffective as a waiver and the police may not proceed with the interrogation until the suspect's intentions are made clear. The requirement that a waiver be unequivocal must be distinguished from situations in which the suspect made an equivocal assertion of their Miranda rights after the interrogation began. Any post-waiver assertion of a suspect's Miranda rights must be clear and unequivocal.<ref>''[[Davis v. United States (1994)|Davis v. United States]]'', 512 U.S. 452 (1994)</ref> Any ambiguity or equivocation will be ineffective. If the suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the interrogating officers are permitted to ask questions to clarify the suspect's intentions, although they are not required to.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\">''Davis v. United States'' (1994)</ref> In other words, if a suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the police may either attempt to clarify the suspect's intentions or they may simply ignore the ineffective assertion and continue with the interrogation.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\"/> The timing of the assertion is significant. Requesting an attorney prior to arrest is of no consequence because ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations. The police may simply ignore the request and continue with the questioning; however, the suspect is also free to leave.\n\n==Assertion==\nIf the defendant asserts his right to remain silent all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless they have \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's assertion and subsequently obtained a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation.<ref>\"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear: if the individual indicates, in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody.\" ''Michigan v. Moseley'', 423 U.S. 96 (1975) quoting ''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U. S. 436 (1966) at 384 U.S. 473\u201374. Note the defendant's assertion of their fifth amendment [[right to silence]] cannot be used as substantive evidence of guilt, or to impeach the defendant's testimony. (''Doyle v. Ohio'')</ref> In determining whether the police \"scrupulously honored\" the assertion the courts apply a totality of the circumstances test. The most important factors are the length of time between termination of the original interrogation and the commencement of the second, and issuing a new set of Miranda warnings before resumption of interrogation.\n\nThe consequences of assertion of Sixth Amendment right to counsel are stricter.<ref>A request to speak to a third person who is not an attorney does not invoke right to counsel. ''Fare v. Michael C.'', 442 U.S. 707 (1979)</ref> The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present (merely consulting with counsel is insufficient) or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police.<ref>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear ''Maryland v. Shatzer'' to determine how long the protections afforded by the Edwards rule last. [http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2009/01/tackling-edwards-v-arizona-one.html Tackling ''Edwards v. Arizona'' One More Time]</ref> If the defendant does reinitiate contact, a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume.\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court declared in a 5\u20134 decision that criminal defendants who have been read their ''Miranda'' rights (and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them), must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self-incrimination to apply. If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the Miranda right to remain silent, or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention, the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they do not want to speak to police. Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case. This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion, which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent, saying: \"Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.\" Thus, having been \"Mirandized\", a suspect may avow explicitly the invocation of these rights, or, alternatively, simply remain silent. Absent the former, \"anything [said] can and will be used against [the defendant] in a court of law\".\n\n==Exceptions==\nAssuming that the six factors are present, the Miranda rule would apply unless the prosecution can establish that the statement falls within an exception to the Miranda rule.<ref>The statement of the defendant is admissible when offered by the state as substantive evidence of guilt as an admission of a party opponent. This exception or exemption from the hearsay rules is not available to the defendant\u2014the defendant must resort to some other exception if he attempts to offer his own statement into evidence. Further if the defendant is successful in offering his own statement as substantive evidence, then the defendant is the hearsay declarant and the state can impeach the defendant as it would any other witness including the use of potentially devastating evidence of prior convictions.</ref> The three exceptions are:\n\n# the routine booking question exception<ref>See ''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n# the jail house informant exception\n# the public safety exception.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984)</ref>\n\nArguably only the last is a true exception\u2014the first two can better be viewed as consistent with the ''Miranda'' factors. For example, questions that are routinely asked as part of the administrative process of arrest and custodial commitment are not considered \"interrogation\" under Miranda because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses. Nonetheless, all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule. The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state-agent; either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate, a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information.<ref>See ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990)</ref>\n\n===Public safety exception===\nThe \"public safety\" exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without Miranda warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety; thus, the ''Miranda'' rule provides some elasticity.<ref name=\"Stigall, Dan E. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Stigall|first=Dan E.|title=Counterterrorism and the Comparative Law of Investigative Detention|publisher=Cambria|year=2009|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-60497-618-2}}</ref>\n\nThe public safety exception derives from ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'' (1984), a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \"The gun is over there\". The Supreme Court found that such an unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because \"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on ''[[:wikt:post hoc|post hoc]]'' findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer\".<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984).</ref> Thus, the jurisprudential rule of ''Miranda'' must yield in \"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda\".\n\nUnder this exception, to be admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist\", and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety\".<ref>Benoit, Carl A.

Once the suspect is formally charged, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel would attach and surreptitious interrogation would be prohibited.<ref name=Massiah>''[[United States v. Massiah]]'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964).</ref> The public safety exception applies where circumstances present a clear and present danger to the public's safety and the officers have reason to believe that the suspect has information that can end the emergency.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984).</ref>\n\n==Consequences of violation==\nAssuming that a Miranda violation occurred\u2014the six factors are present and no exception applies\u2014the statement will be subject to suppression under the Miranda exclusionary rule.<ref>A common misconception is that a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights warrants dismissal of the charges. Generally, a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights will not result in dismissal of the charges unless the defendant can show that the violation was especially egregious.</ref> That is, if the defendant objects or files a motion to suppress, the exclusionary rule would prohibit the prosecution from offering the statement as proof of guilt. However, the statement can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>The statement must be \"voluntary\" under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. An involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref> Further, the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] doctrine does not apply to Miranda violations.<ref>Note that if the seizure of the defendant violated the fourth amendment any confession that resulted from the seizure would be subject to suppression. For example, an officer stops a defendant because the officer has a \"gut feeling\" that the defendant is driving while impaired. After the stop the officer asks the defendant if he had been drinking and the defendant says: \"Yes\". The officer then arrests the defendant and takes him to the law enforcement center to administer a breathalyzer test. While in the breathalyzer room the officer asks the defendant the questions on his alcohol influence report. The defendant's responses are incriminating. Under this scenario because the initial stop was unconstitutional all evidence that resulted from the stop would be subject to suppression.</ref> Therefore, the exclusionary rule exceptions, attenuation, independent source and inevitable discovery, do not come into play, and derivative evidence would be fully admissible. For example, suppose the police continue with a custodial interrogation after the suspect has asserted his right to silence. During his post-assertion statement the suspect tells the police the location of the gun he used in the murder. Using this information the police find the gun. Forensic testing identifies the gun as the murder weapon, and fingerprints lifted from the gun match the suspect's. The contents of the Miranda-defective statement could not be offered by the prosecution as substantive evidence, but the gun itself and all related forensic evidence could be used as evidence at trial.\n\n===Procedural requirements===\nAlthough the rules vary by jurisdiction, generally a person who wishes to contest the admissibility of evidence<ref>Evidence includes physical evidence, confessions and identification evidence. Derivative evidence may also be excluded.

Failure to assert a ground may be treated as waiver. The defendant must also assert facts that show that a substantial claim exists. The assertion must be specific, detailed, definite and nonconjectural. Adams & Blinka, ''Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions'', 2nd ed. (Lexis 1998) at 7. citing ''United States v. Calderon'', 77 F.3rd 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996) Conclusory statements such as the defendant was \"coerced\" or \"under duress\" carry little weight.</ref>\n# The motion must be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence.<ref>North Carolina requires that the affidavit be based on first hand knowledge or on information and belief.

United States]]'') prohibits the admission of a confession obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Specifically, the Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed. The events that trigger the Sixth Amendment safeguards under ''Massiah'' are (1) the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and (2) deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial and to assure that the adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the \"prosecutorial forces\" of the state.\n\n====Commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings====\nThe Sixth Amendment right \"attaches\" once the government has committed itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings \"by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment\".<ref>''United States v. Gouveia'', 467 U.S. 180, 187\u201388, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2297, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984). \"In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court's landmark opinion in ''Powell v. Alabama'', 287 U.S. 45, it has been firmly established that a person's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him. See ''Powell v. Alabama'', supra; ''Johnson v. Zerbst'', 304 U.S. 458; ''Hamilton v. Alabama'', 368 U.S. 52; ''Gideon v. Wainwright'', 372 U.S. 335; ''White v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 59; ''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201; ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218; ''Gilbert v. California'', 388 U.S. 263; ''Coleman v. Alabama'', 399 U.S. 1.\" \"... [W]hile members of the Court have differed as to the existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"</ref> Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Courts cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins.<ref>''Michigan v. Jackson'', 475 U.S. 625, 632 (1986); see also ''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1977). In ''Maine v. Moulton'' the court stated \"By its very terms, it becomes applicable only when the government's role shifts from investigation to accusation. For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the intricacies ... of law,\" ibid., is needed to assure that the prosecution's case encounters \"the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing\". The Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until such time as the \"government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified ...'\" ''Kirby v. Illinois'', 406 U. S. 689 (1972).</ref> Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation. A critical stage is \"any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial\".<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218, 226, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1932, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); see also, ''United States v. Hidalgo'', 7 F.3d 1566 (11th Cir. 1993). Under the critical stage analysis, virtually every phase of the criminal trial is a critical stage. Additionally courts have generally held that pretrial hearings regarding conditions of pretrial release and suppression of evidence are considered critical stages. ''Smith v. Lockhart'', 923 F.2d 1314 (8th Cir. 1991) on the other hand courts have generally held that certain pre-trial post accusation investigative procedures are not critical stages. Analysis of fingerprints, blood samples, clothing, hair, handwriting, and voice samples have all been ruled to be noncritical stages. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, (2001)</ref>\n\nGovernment attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 97 S. Ct. 1232 (1977) \"That the incriminating statements were elicited surreptitiously in the ''Massiah'' case, and otherwise here, is constitutionally irrelevant. See ibid.; ''McLeod v. Ohio'', 381 U. S. 356; ''United States v. Crisp'', 435 F.2d 354, 358 (CA7)\"</ref>\n\n====Deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents====\nDeliberate elicitation is defined as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely to produce incriminating information from the defendant.<ref>''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990).</ref> Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants.<ref>''Massiah'' does not prohibit the government's use of a cellmate as a \"silent listening post\"\u2014a person who is simply placed in a position to hear any incriminating statements the defendant might make about the charged offense but who does not do anything to coax or induce the defendant to talk about the charged crime. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436 (1986).</ref>\n\nThe definition of \"deliberate elicitation\" is not the same as the definition of \"interrogation\" under the Miranda rule. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific&nbsp;\u2013 the right only applies to post-commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged.<ref>''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 111 S. Ct. 2204 (1991). Lower federal courts has extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to factually related offenses. In Texas v. Cobb, the Supreme Court made clear that the right to counsel applied only to the crime charged and did not apply to attempts to gather information about \"other offenses 'closely related factually' to the charged offense\". ''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref> The right does not extend to uncharged offenses if factually related to the charged crime.<ref>''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref>\n\nAs noted, information obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel. The waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387 (1977)</ref> A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right.\n\n====Miranda and Massiah compared====\n# ''' Constitutional basis''':\n#* Miranda is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n#* Massiah is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n# '''Attachment''':\n#* Miranda: Custody + interrogation (charging status irrelevant).\n#* Massiah: Formally charged + deliberate elicitation (custodial status irrelevant).\n# '''Scope''':\n#*a. Miranda applies to custodial interrogation by known governmental agents. Surreptitious acquisition of incriminating information allowed.\n#*a. Massiah applies to overt and surreptitious interrogation.\n#*b. Miranda is not offense specific.<ref>''Mathis v. United States'', 391 U.S. 1 (1968)</ref>\n#*b. Massiah is offense specific.<ref>See ''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 501 U.S. 171 (1991)</ref>\n#*c. Miranda: interrogation + \"functional equivalent\"\n#*c. Massiah: interrogation + \"deliberate elicitation\"\n# '''Waiver''': Both Miranda and Massiah rights may be waived.\n# '''Assertion''': In each case, the assertion must be clear and unequivocal. The effects of assertion are not identical. For purposes of Miranda, the police must immediately cease the interrogation and cannot resume interrogating the defendant about any offense charged or uncharged unless counsel is present or defendant initiates contact for purposes of resuming interrogation and valid waiver obtained. Because Massiah is offense-specific, an assertion of the sixth amendment right to counsel requires the police to cease interrogating the defendant about any charged offense. Apparently the police could continue questioning the defendant about uncharged crimes assuming that the defendant was not in custody. The defendant's remedy would be to leave or to refuse to answer questions.<ref>Under ''Michigan v. Jackson'', a defendant's request for counsel at a preliminary hearing constituted an assertion of his sixth amendment right to counsel. However, ''Michigan v. Jackson'' was overruled by ''Montejo v. Louisiana .''</ref>\n# '''Remedy for violation''': The remedy for violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel is identical: the statements and testimonial information are subject to suppression. Derivative evidence is not subject to suppression under Miranda&nbsp;\u2013 fruit of poisonous tree doctrine may apply to Massiah violation.<ref>''Fellers v. United States'', 124 S.Ct. 1019 (2004)</ref> Both Miranda and Massiah defective statements can be used for impeachment purposes.\n# '''Exceptions''': The primary exceptions to Miranda are (1) the routine booking questions exception (2) the jail house informant exception and (3) the public safety exception. In ''Moulton v. Maine'' the Supreme Court refused to recognize a public safety exception to the Massiah rule.<ref>474 U.S. 159 (1989)</ref> Massiah allows for the use of jail house informants provided the informants serve merely as \"passive listeners\".<ref>The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide another basis for challenging the admissibility of confessions. The test is whether the statement was \"voluntary\". A statement is not voluntary if it was the product of police misconduct. That is a due process claim requires that the defendant establish that there was police misconduct and that this misconduct induced the confession. The \"voluntariness\" test is implicated in any police interrogation\u2014neither Miranda \"custody\" or Massiah \"commencement of formal criminal proceedings\" is a necessary conditions (state action is required). Further, there are no issues of waiver or assertion. Finally the remedy is complete\u2014an involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref>\n\n===The voluntariness standard===\nThe voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and regardless of whether the suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>Originally Miranda was regarded as a \"prophylactic\" rule\u2014the rule itself was not a constitutional right but a \" judicially\u2013created enforcement mechanism\" devised to protect the underlying constitutional rights. In Dickerson v. United States, the Court \"constitutionalized\" the Miranda rule\u2014although the decision did not perforce change the rule concerning the use of a Miranda-defective statement for impeachment purposes.</ref> The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in ''Colorado v. Connelly''.<ref>''Colorado v. Connelly'', 479 U.S. 157 (1986)</ref> Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances.<ref>See ''Mincey v. Arizona'', 437 U.S. 385 (1978); ''Greenwald v. Wisconsin'', 390 U. S. 519, 390 U.S. 521 (1968) (\"Considering the totality of these circumstances, we do not think it credible that petitioner's statements were the product of his free and rational choice\"); Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 367 U.S. 440 (1961) (\"If [a defendant's will was overborne], the confession cannot be deemed 'the product of a rational intellect and a free will'\")</ref> \"Voluntary\" carried its everyday meaning: the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion.<ref>See e.g., ''Culombe v. Connecticut'', 367 U.S. 568, 367 U.S. 583 (1961) (\"[A]n extrajudicial confession, if it was to be offered in evidence against a man, must be the product of his own free choice\")</ref> After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996) at 247.</ref> Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996)</ref>\n\n===State constitutional challenges===\nEvery state constitution has articles and provision guaranteeing individual rights.<ref>Latzer, ''State Constitutions and Criminal Justice'' (Greenwood 1991)</ref> In most cases the subject matter is similar to the federal bill of rights.<ref>Id. at 2. This similarity is hardly surprising since the federal constitution and many state constitutions had common sources the state constitutions of some of the more important states such as Virginia.</ref> Most state courts interpretation of their constitution is consistent with the interpretation federal court's of analogous provisions of the federal constitution. With regard to Miranda issues, state courts have exhibited significant resistance to incorporating into their state jurisprudence some of the limitations on the Miranda rule that have been created by the federal courts.<ref>Id. at 89\u201391.</ref> As a consequence a defendant may be able to circumvent the federal limitation on the Miranda rule and successfully challenge the admissibility under state constitutional provisions. Practically every aspect of the Miranda rule has drawn state court criticism. However the primary point of contention involve the following limitations on the scope of the Miranda rule: (1) the Harris exception<ref>In ''Harris'' the United States Supreme Court allowed a Miranda-defective statement to be used to impeach the trial testimony of a defendant. Note the Harris rule does not permit the use of a statement that fails to meet the voluntariness standards of the due process clause to be used for any purpose. The basis for the distinction is that a Miranda-defective statement does not raise the questions of unreliability as does an involuntary statement.</ref> (2) the Burbine rule<ref>In ''Moran v. Burbine'', 475 U.S. 412 (1986) the Court held that officers are not required to tell a suspect in custody that third parties had retained an attorney for the suspect. The failure of the police to inform the suspect of this fact did not render the waiver involuntary. ''Burbine'' decision was not well-received by the state courts. Six states specifically rejected the Burbine rule.</ref> and (3) the Fare rule.<ref>id. at 91\u201398. The specific holding in Fare was that a juvenile's request to have his probation officer present during an interrogation was not an invocation of the juvenile's right to counsel. The Supreme Court stated that juveniles were essentially to be treated the same as adults for the purposes of Miranda. Many states adopted special rules concerning police interrogation of juveniles not true</ref>\n\n===State statutory challenges===\nIn addition to constitutionally based challenge, states permit a defendant to challenge the admissibility of a confession on the grounds that the confession was obtained in violation of a defendant's statutory rights. For example, North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act permits a defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a \"substantial\" violation of the provision of the North Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n==Confusion regarding use==\nDue to the prevalence of American television programs and motion pictures in which the police characters frequently read suspects their rights, it has become an expected element of arrest procedure\u2014in the 2000 ''Dickerson'' decision, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] wrote that Miranda warnings had \"become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\".<ref>''[[Dickerson v. United States]]'' {{ussc|530|428|2000}}.</ref>\n\nWhile arrests and interrogations can legally occur without the Miranda warning being given, this procedure would generally make the arrestee's pre-Miranda statements inadmissible at trial. (However, pursuant to the plurality opinion in ''[[United States v. Patane]]'', physical evidence obtained as a result of pre-Miranda statements may still be admitted. There was no majority opinion of the Court in that case.)\n\nIn some jurisdictions,{{where|date=July 2011}} a ''detention'' differs at law from an ''arrest'', and police are not required to give the Miranda warning until the person is arrested for a crime. In those situations, a person's statements made to police are generally admissible even though the person was not advised of their rights. Similarly, statements made while an arrest is in progress before the Miranda warning was given or completed are also generally admissible.\n\nBecause ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations, it does not protect detainees from standard booking questions such as name and address. Because it is a protective measure intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, it does not prevent the police from taking blood without a warrant from persons suspected of [[Drunk driving (United States)|driving under the influence of alcohol]]. (Such evidence may be self-incriminatory, but are not considered statements of self-incrimination.)\n\nIf an inmate is in jail and invoked ''Miranda'' on one case, it is unclear whether this extends to any other cases that they may be charged with while in custody. For example: a subject is arrested, charged with cattle rustling, and is held in county jail awaiting trial. He invoked his Miranda rights on the cow case. While in custody, he is involved in a fight where a staff member loses his ability to walk. He speaks to the custodial staff regarding the fight without staff first invoking Miranda. It is unclear if this statement is admissible because of the original Miranda statement.\n\nMany police departments give special training to interrogators with regard to the Miranda warning; specifically, how to influence a suspect's decision to waive the right. For instance, the officer may be required to specifically ask if the rights are understood and if the suspect wishes to talk. The officer is allowed, before asking the suspect a question, to speak at length about evidence collected, witness statements, etc. The officer will ''then'' ask if the suspect wishes to talk, and the suspect is then more likely to talk in an attempt to refute the evidence presented. Another tactic commonly taught is never to ask a question; the officer may simply sit the suspect down in an interrogation room, sit across from him and do paperwork, and wait for the suspect to begin talking.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724033316/http://www.regent.edu/admin/media/schlaw/LawPreview/ Prof. James Duane and Officer George Bruch \u2013 Fifth Amendment Lecture at Regent University].</ref> These tactics are intended to mitigate the restrictions placed on law officers against compelling a suspect to give evidence, and have stood up in court as valid lawful tactics.

Perkins'']], 496 U.S. 292 (1990), the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that undercover officers do not have to give suspects a ''Miranda'' warning prior to asking questions that may elicit incriminating responses. In this case, an undercover agent posed as an inmate and carried on a 35-minute conversation with another inmate that he suspected of committing a murder that was being investigated. During this conversation, the suspect implicated himself in the murder that the undercover agent was investigating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/496/292 |title=Supreme.justia.com |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court came to this conclusion despite the government's admission that a custodial interrogation had been conducted by a government agent.\n\n===Report of warnings being given to detainees in Afghanistan===\nBeginning in 2009, some detainees captured in [[Afghanistan]] have been read their Miranda rights by the [[FBI]], according to Congressman [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Michael Rogers]] of Michigan, who claims to have witnessed this himself.

The fraternity considers the first Friday of February as Red Dress Pin Day and the month of February as Cardiac Care Month where individual Alpha Phi chapters are encouraged to develop a relationship with a local cardiac care project in their community as well as to promote awareness of women's heart disease.\n\nCollegiate chapters of Alpha Phi host a philanthropy event known as The Red Dress Gala (also called \"Red Dress Ball\" or \"Aphiasco\" by some chapters), which includes a silent auction, guest speakers, and a full dinner for sisters, alumni, and family. Traditionally, the collegiate members wear red dresses to represent their support for Women's Heart Health. This event raises funds for their Foundation and the Heart to Heart Grant.

The fraternity officially adopted Cardiac Care as its philanthropic priority in 1946, which then became the Foundation's focus upon its founding in 1956. The Foundation supports programs and research that study heart disease in women \u2013 specifically its symptoms, its treatment and its prevention. The foundation raises and awards funds and grants for programs in leadership and academics, towards women's heart health, for members with financial needs, and for heritage preservation and education about philanthropy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foundation.alphaphi.org/index.php/about/mission-vision|title=Mission/ Vision|work=Alpha Phi Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421063203/http://foundation.alphaphi.org/index.php/about/mission-vision|archivedate=April 21, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation helps fund research and educational programs that support the improvement of women's heart health through its annual Heart to Heart Cardiac Care Grant, a $100,000 award towards better understanding gender differences in heart health through increasing heart disease prevention and treatment in women. The fraternity considers the first Friday of February as Red Dress Pin Day and the month of February as Cardiac Care Month where individual Alpha Phi chapters are encouraged to develop a relationship with a local cardiac care project in their community as well as to promote awareness of women's heart disease.\n\nCollegiate chapters of Alpha Phi host a philanthropy event known as The Red Dress Gala (also called \"Red Dress Ball\" or \"Aphiasco\" by some chapters), which includes a silent auction, guest speakers, and a full dinner for sisters, alumni, and family. Traditionally, the collegiate members wear red dresses to represent their support for Women's Heart Health. This event raises funds for their Foundation and the Heart to Heart Grant. Collegiate chapters, alumnae chapters and individual members can nominate a local heart project for the Heart to Heart Cardiac Care Grant. Self-nominations are also accepted.
