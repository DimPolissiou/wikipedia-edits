Baier''' (born January 6, 1940) - is an American attorney, successful entrepreneur, and an environmental historian and author. He has dedicated his life to natural resources and wildlife conservation. Throughout his career he has been an advisor to many elected officials and educators, including every successive presidential administration since [[George H. W. Bush]], and has been an active and instrumental member of several national conservation groups.\n\n==Early years and education==\nLowell E. Baier was born on January 6, 1940, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He grew up on a farm outside the small town of [[Remington, Indiana]].  He was a member of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He became an Eagle Scout in 1954, at the age of 14. In 1956 his Congressman [[Charles A. Halleck]] (R-2nd IN) appointed him to be his Page Boy in the United States House of Representatives, because he was the first Boy Scout to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout in Jasper County, Indiana. He developed a passion for wildlife and natural resource conservation early in life that has greatly influenced his career.\n\nBaier received his B.A. in economics and political science from [[Valparaiso University]] in 1961. He went on to attend law school at [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law|Indiana University School of Law]] in Bloomington, Indiana, where he received his J.D. in 1964.\n\nHe served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1956 to 1964.\n\n==Career==\nLowell E. Baier's intellectual curiosity during his long career has taken him from a practicing attorney, to an entrepreneur, to a tireless advocate for natural resources and wildlife conservation, to a legal and environmental historian and author. After law school, Baier moved to Washington, D.C., to practice law. During the early years of his law career, he formed Baier Properties, Inc., based in Bethesda, Maryland. This company develops warehouses, residential properties, award-winning office buildings, and shopping centers.\n\nBaier has devoted much of his life's work to natural resources and wildlife conservation. He was one of the original founders of the [https://www.wildsheepfoundation.org/ Wild Sheep Foundation]. This organization funds over $2.4 million annually to reestablish historically extant habitats and populations of the four species of wild sheep in North America. Baier's exploratory work for this organization led to his active participation in creating similar programs in Russia and Mongolia.<ref>IU Bloomington Newsroom, [http://archive.news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2015/05/baier-hall-dedication-advisory.shtml Media Advisory: Baier Hall Naming Ceremony], May 6, 2015.</ref>\n\nBaier has been active in the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] (America's oldest wildlife conservation organization) since 1975.

Baier, Affiliated Visiting Scholar, Conservation Law Center].</ref>\n\nBaier has taken his environmental and wildlife conservation passion into politics as well, having served as an advisor to many elected officials and educators. Baier took the lead in drafting President George H. W. Bush's wildlife conservation agenda in 1989,<ref name=\"Bush\">For more on George H. W.

Retrieved on 1 May 2009.</ref>\n\nSouth Adelaide was led from 1888 to 1898 by captain and \"proto-coach\" [[John Reedman|Dinny Reedman]] who is generally seen as the first to view team combination and planning as a critical component of success in football. In 1896 they won sixteen and drew two of eighteen games.<ref name=\"premiership\">[http://www.safc.com.au/images/safc%20premiership%20panels.pdf South Adelaide Premiership Panels]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Decline after District Football===\n[[File:Jack Tredrea 1920.jpeg|160px|thumb|left|[[Jack Tredrea]] was the first South Australian league player to reach 200 games]]\n[[Zoning (Australian rules football)|District football]] was introduced optionally in 1897 and became compulsory in 1899. This was difficult for South Adelaide, who had under Reedman obtained most of its top players from Christian Brothers College,<ref name=\"premiership\"/> and even in 1899 when it won its sixth premiership in eight years half its side came therefrom. With the loss of Reedman and Jones to North Adelaide, and after one season goalsneak \"Bos\" Daly to West Torrens in 1900, the blue and whites declined steadily. This was exacerbated by the admission of Sturt in 1901. South Adelaide was runner-up in [[1903 SAFA season|1903]] to [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], but won only 26 and drew two of 108 games between 1906 and 1914, including a [[imperfect season|winless season]] in [[1909 SAFL season|1909]] and two consecutive one-win seasons (both wins by less than a goal) in [[1910 SAFL season|1910]] and [[1911 SAFL season|1911]].<ref>See [http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/South%2BAdelaide/320/1911 South Adelaide in 1911]</ref> In 1915, South improved to second before lack of finals experience took its toll in the semi-final.\n\nFollowing an enforced halt to SAFL football during [[World War I]], the presence of champion defender [[Dan Moriarty (Australian rules footballer born 1895)|Dan Moriarty]] made South highly competitive between 1919 and 1924, though it never rose above third in 1921. However, after his retirement South took four consecutive [[List of SANFL wooden spoons|wooden spoons]] from 1926 to 1929 and did not finish above sixth in an eight-team competition between 1925 and 1934, winning only thirty and drawing three of 160 games. It was generally known that South had an unfairly small share of the area zoned between eight league clubs,<ref name=\"biography\">[http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/South%2BAdelaide/320 South Adelaide Club Biography]</ref> but the league committee refused to alter the status quo.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Brief Halcyon and Abrupt Fall===\nIn response to South Adelaide's limited metropolitan recruiting resources, the club began a concerted country recruiting campaign during the 1930s. This bore spectacular fruit between 1935 and 1940. Under coach [[Vic Johnson (Australian rules football)|Vic Johnson]], South Adelaide after a slow start played impressive football throughout 1935 and ultimately upset Port Adelaide for its first premiership since 1899. [[Jack Cockburn]] at centre half-back was the team's star and won the Magarey Medal. After two more seasons in the finals, South Adelaide reached a high point in 1938, losing only two games and swamping Port Adelaide with a 13-goal third quarter in the Grand Final.<ref>[http://australianfootball.com/articles/view/South%2Bswamps%2BPort%2B-%2B1938%2BSANFL%2Bgrand%2Bfinal/14 South Swamps Port]</ref> Led by Clem Rosewarne, Max Murdy and [[Len Lapthorne]], South averaged an amazing 132 points per game, and even without Rosewarne their attack remained extremely potent in 1939 and 1940, averaging 125 points over the minor round. The blue and whites failed badly in the 1939 finals, but won two finals before losing to Sturt in 1940.\n\n1941 saw South slip to fifth with only six wins, but that could hardly have prepared them for the experiences of the following two decades after full-scale football resumed after [[World War II]].<ref>Between 1942 and 1944 the SANFL contested a restricted, four team competition with its eight member clubs paired off geographically: Port Adelaide-West Torrens; Norwood-North Adelaide; West Adelaide-Glenelg and South Adelaide-Sturt</ref> Between 1947 and 1951 South won only seven games out of eighty-six, and from 1945 to 1963 South never won more than six games in a season, nor finished above any rival except Glenelg and Sturt. Other clubs with greater financial resources duplicated South's 1930s country recruiting campaigns and the club turned over coaches at an extraordinary rate. Eight coaches were employed in nine seasons from 1953 to 1961: even a spell by Port Adelaide legend \"Fos\" Williams in 1960 failed to raise them above second last, and neither did the adoption of the club's current nickname \"The Panthers\" in 1957<ref>[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=7363 SA Memory]</ref>\n\n===Kerley and Another Decline===\nIn 1959, after doubting whether the club was viable as a league team, the SANFL granted South Adelaide a substantial area of newly developing southern Adelaide suburbs. During the early 1960s it became apparent that South Adelaide, though only marginally better statistically than the dreadful late 1940s and early 1950s teams, was possessed of enough talent to move beyond the bottom couple of placings. In 1963, South Adelaide sought the services of proven West Adelaide player/coach [[Neil Kerley]] after he was controversially sacked by the Bloods, and despite being sceptical Kerley did accept and put the team on an intense training schedule during the 1963/1964 off-season.<ref name=\"biography\"/>\n\nSouth Adelaide rose rapidly in 1964, losing only three minor round games before defeating Port Adelaide by 27 points in the Grand Final. It remained prominent for the remaining two years of Kerley's stint but failed to make the grand final. However, under champion player Peter Darley as captain-coach the Panthers declined very quickly owing to the loss of key followers Kerley and David Kantilla,<ref>[http://wap.afl.com.au/news.htm;jsessionid=1B66EC490E1307656F86D26FE4641F08?action=handleNewsArticleById&id=114286&listRetrievedBy=COMPETITION&listId=1 David Kantilla: Indigenous Pioneer]</ref> winning only two games in 1969 for another wooden spoon and not improving until another renowned coach in [[Haydn Bunton, Jr.]] took over the reins in 1975. Under Bunton, the Panthers, playing fast, skilful football firmly rooted in the South \"tradition\",<ref name=\"biography\"/> contested the major round for the first time in eleven years in 1977 and reached the Grand Final in 1979. However, on an appallingly windy day and muddy ground the experienced Port Adelaide, aided by winning the toss, were too good, winning 9-9 (63) to 3-14 (32). The Panthers fluctuated in yo-yo fashion under Bunton, never playing in two consecutive finals series before he departed to return to [[Subiaco Football Club|Subiaco]] after a sabbatical at the end of 1982.\n\n===Noarlunga===\nIn 1979, South Adelaide's recruiting zone in the southern suburbs was extended to cover all the developing areas around [[O'Halloran Hill, South Australia|O\u2018Halloran Hill]], giving the club a potential community base for the first time in its long history. It continued to play at Adelaide Oval until 1994 (the oval was ironically located on the northern side of the [[City of Adelaide]] and [[River Torrens]]), and its fortunes fluctuated, with two unsuccessful finals appearances under future [[Adelaide Crows]] coach [[Graham Cornes]] in 1983 and 1984 being followed by free-fall under the coaching of former {{AFL Haw}} ([[VFL/AFL|VFL]]) ruckman [[Don Scott (footballer)|Don Scott]] and [[Sturt Football Club|Sturt]] champion [[full forward]] [[Rick Davies (footballer)|Rick Davies]] to a wooden spoon in 1987. South was under severe pressure to enter into a merger with another SANFL club, but was argued that if South made the long-proposed move to Noarlunga it would be able to capture expanding suburbs in the future.\n\nUnder [[John Reid (Australian footballer)|John Reid]], South developed rapidly after a one-win season and twenty-six successive losses during 1988 and early 1989. After this disastrous losing streak, South rose to contest each SANFL finals series between 1990 and 1992, with a minor premiership in 1991 the highlight, the Panthers being bundled out by West Adelaide in the Preliminary Final. However, the Panthers have been a disappointment in the two decades since the formation of the [[Adelaide Crows]] in 1991, with fourth-place finishes in 2006 and 2011 its highest placings, and some dubious coaching changes such as the sacking of former {{AFL StK}} coach [[Ken Sheldon]] in 1996, and briefly employing seventy-one-year-old veteran [[John Cahill (footballer)|John Cahill]] during 2008. After this, the Panthers won only four games in the 2009 and 2010 seasons for their worst two-season record since the dark days of 1950 and 1951.\n\nThree South Australian Premiers have had a close association with the South Adelaide Football Club: [[Charles Cameron Kingston]] (Premier 1893-1899), [[Dean Brown]] (1993-96) and [[Mike Rann]] (2002-2011). Kingston played for South Adelaide, Dean Brown became Patron and Mike Rann was Number One Ticket Holder.  During his Premiership Rann presented the Club with a 100-year peppercorn lease over the Noarlunga Oval site owned by the State Government in what he described as 'land rights for the Panthers'. The club presented the Premier with 100 peppercorns.\n\nSouth Adelaide entered a team in the [[SANFL Women's League]] in 2018. In their short history fielding a women's team, they have become the most successful team in the competition, winning back-to-back premierships in 2018/19.<ref>{{cite web|title=South wins back-to-back flags|url=https://sanfl.com.au/league/news/south-wins-back-to-back-flags/|work=sanfl.com.au|date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Home Grounds==\n#[[Adelaide Oval]] (1882\u20131903, 1905\u201394)\n#[[Jubilee Oval (Adelaide)|Jubilee Oval]] (1904)\n#[[Flinders University Stadium]] (1995\u2013present)\n\nPanther Park was meant to be South's new home ground with plans to build a grandstand but only the change rooms were built and it was used as a training base and for South's junior teams.\nSouth Adelaide's clubrooms were based at Panther Park at the inner-southern Adelaide suburb of [[St Marys, South Australia|St Mary's]] until 1995 when the club moved to [[Noarlunga Downs, South Australia|Noarlunga]] and its new ground Flinders University Stadium (then called Noarlunga Oval). Prior to 1995, with the exception of 1904 when they played at the now defunct Jubilee Oval, the Panthers played all their home games at the [[Adelaide Oval]] (ironically located on the northern side of the [[Adelaide city centre]]) while in 1992 and 1993 they played two games at the [[Bice Oval]] in the southern suburb of [[Christies Beach, South Australia|Christies Beach]] to gauge support in the area for the Panthers. The oval, located only 1&nbsp;km from where Hickinbotham Oval now sits, was packed to capacity in 1993 with approximately 8,000 crammed in to see South take on 'local' rival [[Glenelg Tigers|Glenelg]]. It was following this game that the South Adelaide Football Club made the decision to move permanently to Noarlunga.\n\nSouth Adelaide christened their new home at Noarlunga in Round 8 of the 1995 SANFL season. The opening game at Noarlunga also saw the ground record crowd of 10,123 when Glenelg defeated the Panthers by 47 points. Originally called Noarlunga Oval, the name was officially changed to Hickinbotham Oval in 2005 to honour former Panther and successful property developer, the late [[Alan Hickinbotham]].<ref name=ah/>\n\nIn late 2010 the South Adelaide Football Club obtained permission from the [[City of Onkaparinga]] to install four light towers at the oval with the intent to host night SANFL games at the venue. Unlike other SANFL grounds which had lights installed, Hickenbotham Oval is not surrounded by housing and permission to build the lights was easily obtained as they were ruled to have minimal impact on the local residents. The first game played under lights on 9 April 2011 saw South defeat [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]] in front of 2,630. The record night attendance at the oval was set just a few weeks later in Round 4 of the 2011 SANFL season when 2,700 saw the clash between the Panthers and [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port

Retrieved on 1 May 2009.</ref>\n\nSouth Adelaide was led from 1888 to 1898 by captain and \"proto-coach\" [[John Reedman|Dinny Reedman]] who is generally seen as the first to view team combination and planning as a critical component of success in football. In 1896 they won sixteen and drew two of eighteen games.<ref name=\"premiership\">[http://www.safc.com.au/images/safc%20premiership%20panels.pdf South Adelaide Premiership Panels]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Decline after District Football===\n[[File:Jack Tredrea 1920.jpeg|160px|thumb|left|[[Jack Tredrea]] was the first South Australian league player to reach 200 games]]\n[[Zoning (Australian rules football)|District football]] was introduced optionally in 1897 and became compulsory in 1899. This was difficult for South Adelaide, who had under Reedman obtained most of its top players from Christian Brothers College,<ref name=\"premiership\"/> and even in 1899 when it won its sixth premiership in eight years half its side came therefrom. With the loss of Reedman and Jones to North Adelaide, and after one season goalsneak \"Bos\" Daly to West Torrens in 1900, the blue and whites declined steadily. This was exacerbated by the admission of Sturt in 1901. South Adelaide was runner-up in [[1903 SAFA season|1903]] to [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], but won only 26 and drew two of 108 games between 1906 and 1914, including a [[imperfect season|winless season]] in [[1909 SAFL season|1909]] and two consecutive one-win seasons (both wins by less than a goal) in [[1910 SAFL season|1910]] and [[1911 SAFL season|1911]].<ref>See [http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/South%2BAdelaide/320/1911 South Adelaide in 1911]</ref> In 1915, South improved to second before lack of finals experience took its toll in the semi-final.\n\nFollowing an enforced halt to SAFL football during [[World War I]], the presence of champion defender [[Dan Moriarty (Australian rules footballer born 1895)|Dan Moriarty]] made South highly competitive between 1919 and 1924, though it never rose above third in 1921. However, after his retirement South took four consecutive [[List of SANFL wooden spoons|wooden spoons]] from 1926 to 1929 and did not finish above sixth in an eight-team competition between 1925 and 1934, winning only thirty and drawing three of 160 games. It was generally known that South had an unfairly small share of the area zoned between eight league clubs,<ref name=\"biography\">[http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/South%2BAdelaide/320 South Adelaide Club Biography]</ref> but the league committee refused to alter the status quo.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Brief Halcyon and Abrupt Fall===\nIn response to South Adelaide's limited metropolitan recruiting resources, the club began a concerted country recruiting campaign during the 1930s. This bore spectacular fruit between 1935 and 1940. Under coach [[Vic Johnson (Australian rules football)|Vic Johnson]], South Adelaide after a slow start played impressive football throughout 1935 and ultimately upset Port Adelaide for its first premiership since 1899. [[Jack Cockburn]] at centre half-back was the team's star and won the Magarey Medal. After two more seasons in the finals, South Adelaide reached a high point in 1938, losing only two games and swamping Port Adelaide with a 13-goal third quarter in the Grand Final.<ref>[http://australianfootball.com/articles/view/South%2Bswamps%2BPort%2B-%2B1938%2BSANFL%2Bgrand%2Bfinal/14 South Swamps Port]</ref> Led by Clem Rosewarne, Max Murdy and [[Len Lapthorne]], South averaged an amazing 132 points per game, and even without Rosewarne their attack remained extremely potent in 1939 and 1940, averaging 125 points over the minor round. The blue and whites failed badly in the 1939 finals, but won two finals before losing to Sturt in 1940.\n\n1941 saw South slip to fifth with only six wins, but that could hardly have prepared them for the experiences of the following two decades after full-scale football resumed after [[World War II]].<ref>Between 1942 and 1944 the SANFL contested a restricted, four team competition with its eight member clubs paired off geographically: Port Adelaide-West Torrens; Norwood-North Adelaide; West Adelaide-Glenelg and South Adelaide-Sturt</ref> Between 1947 and 1951 South won only seven games out of eighty-six, and from 1945 to 1963 South never won more than six games in a season, nor finished above any rival except Glenelg and Sturt. Other clubs with greater financial resources duplicated South's 1930s country recruiting campaigns and the club turned over coaches at an extraordinary rate. Eight coaches were employed in nine seasons from 1953 to 1961: even a spell by Port Adelaide legend \"Fos\" Williams in 1960 failed to raise them above second last, and neither did the adoption of the club's current nickname \"The Panthers\" in 1957<ref>[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=7363 SA Memory]</ref>\n\n===Kerley and Another Decline===\nIn 1959, after doubting whether the club was viable as a league team, the SANFL granted South Adelaide a substantial area of newly developing southern Adelaide suburbs. During the early 1960s it became apparent that South Adelaide, though only marginally better statistically than the dreadful late 1940s and early 1950s teams, was possessed of enough talent to move beyond the bottom couple of placings. In 1963, South Adelaide sought the services of proven West Adelaide player/coach [[Neil Kerley]] after he was controversially sacked by the Bloods, and despite being sceptical Kerley did accept and put the team on an intense training schedule during the 1963/1964 off-season.<ref name=\"biography\"/>\n\nSouth Adelaide rose rapidly in 1964, losing only three minor round games before defeating Port Adelaide by 27 points in the Grand Final. It remained prominent for the remaining two years of Kerley's stint but failed to make the grand final. However, under champion player Peter Darley as captain-coach the Panthers declined very quickly owing to the loss of key followers Kerley and David Kantilla,<ref>[http://wap.afl.com.au/news.htm;jsessionid=1B66EC490E1307656F86D26FE4641F08?action=handleNewsArticleById&id=114286&listRetrievedBy=COMPETITION&listId=1 David Kantilla: Indigenous Pioneer]</ref> winning only two games in 1969 for another wooden spoon and not improving until another renowned coach in [[Haydn Bunton, Jr.]] took over the reins in 1975. Under Bunton, the Panthers, playing fast, skilful football firmly rooted in the South \"tradition\",<ref name=\"biography\"/> contested the major round for the first time in eleven years in 1977 and reached the Grand Final in 1979. However, on an appallingly windy day and muddy ground the experienced Port Adelaide, aided by winning the toss, were too good, winning 9-9 (63) to 3-14 (32). The Panthers fluctuated in yo-yo fashion under Bunton, never playing in two consecutive finals series before he departed to return to [[Subiaco Football Club|Subiaco]] after a sabbatical at the end of 1982.\n\n===Noarlunga===\nIn 1979, South Adelaide's recruiting zone in the southern suburbs was extended to cover all the developing areas around [[O'Halloran Hill, South Australia|O\u2018Halloran Hill]], giving the club a potential community base for the first time in its long history. It continued to play at Adelaide Oval until 1994 (the oval was ironically located on the northern side of the [[City of Adelaide]] and [[River Torrens]]), and its fortunes fluctuated, with two unsuccessful finals appearances under future [[Adelaide Crows]] coach [[Graham Cornes]] in 1983 and 1984 being followed by free-fall under the coaching of former {{AFL Haw}} ([[VFL/AFL|VFL]]) ruckman [[Don Scott (footballer)|Don Scott]] and [[Sturt Football Club|Sturt]] champion [[full forward]] [[Rick Davies (footballer)|Rick Davies]] to a wooden spoon in 1987. South was under severe pressure to enter into a merger with another SANFL club, but was argued that if South made the long-proposed move to Noarlunga it would be able to capture expanding suburbs in the future.\n\nUnder [[John Reid (Australian footballer)|John Reid]], South developed rapidly after a one-win season and twenty-six successive losses during 1988 and early 1989. After this disastrous losing streak, South rose to contest each SANFL finals series between 1990 and 1992, with a minor premiership in 1991 the highlight, the Panthers being bundled out by West Adelaide in the Preliminary Final. However, the Panthers have been a disappointment in the two decades since the formation of the [[Adelaide Crows]] in 1991, with fourth-place finishes in 2006 and 2011 its highest placings, and some dubious coaching changes such as the sacking of former {{AFL StK}} coach [[Ken Sheldon]] in 1996, and briefly employing seventy-one-year-old veteran [[John Cahill (footballer)|John Cahill]] during 2008. After this, the Panthers won only four games in the 2009 and 2010 seasons for their worst two-season record since the dark days of 1950 and 1951.\n\nThree South Australian Premiers have had a close association with the South Adelaide Football Club: [[Charles Cameron Kingston]] (Premier 1893-1899), [[Dean Brown]] (1993-96) and [[Mike Rann]] (2002-2011). Kingston played for South Adelaide, Dean Brown became Patron and Mike Rann was Number One Ticket Holder.  During his Premiership Rann presented the Club with a 100-year peppercorn lease over the Noarlunga Oval site owned by the State Government in what he described as 'land rights for the Panthers'. The club presented the Premier with 100 peppercorns.\n\nSouth Adelaide entered a team in the [[SANFL Women's League]] in 2018. In their short history fielding a women's team, they have become the most successful team in the competition, winning back-to-back premierships in 2018/19.<ref>{{cite web|title=South wins back-to-back flags|url=https://sanfl.com.au/league/news/south-wins-back-to-back-flags/|work=sanfl.com.au|date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Home Grounds==\n#[[Adelaide Oval]] (1882\u20131903, 1905\u201394)\n#[[Jubilee Oval (Adelaide)|Jubilee Oval]] (1904)\n#[[Flinders University Stadium]] (1995\u2013present)\n\nPanther Park was meant to be South's new home ground with plans to build a grandstand but only the change rooms were built and it was used as a training base and for South's junior teams.\nSouth Adelaide's clubrooms were based at Panther Park at the inner-southern Adelaide suburb of [[St Marys, South Australia|St Mary's]] until 1995 when the club moved to [[Noarlunga Downs, South Australia|Noarlunga]] and its new ground Flinders University Stadium (then called Noarlunga Oval). Prior to 1995, with the exception of 1904 when they played at the now defunct Jubilee Oval, the Panthers played all their home games at the [[Adelaide Oval]] (ironically located on the northern side of the [[Adelaide city centre]]) while in 1992 and 1993 they played two games at the [[Bice Oval]] in the southern suburb of [[Christies Beach, South Australia|Christies Beach]] to gauge support in the area for the Panthers. The oval, located only 1&nbsp;km from where Hickinbotham Oval now sits, was packed to capacity in 1993 with approximately 8,000 crammed in to see South take on 'local' rival [[Glenelg Tigers|Glenelg]]. It was following this game that the South Adelaide Football Club made the decision to move permanently to Noarlunga.\n\nSouth Adelaide christened their new home at Noarlunga in Round 8 of the 1995 SANFL season. The opening game at Noarlunga also saw the ground record crowd of 10,123 when Glenelg defeated the Panthers by 47 points. Originally called Noarlunga Oval, the name was officially changed to Hickinbotham Oval in 2005 to honour former Panther and successful property developer, the late [[Alan Hickinbotham]].<ref name=ah/>\n\nIn late 2010 the South Adelaide Football Club obtained permission from the [[City of Onkaparinga]] to install four light towers at the oval with the intent to host night SANFL games at the venue. Unlike other SANFL grounds which had lights installed, Hickenbotham Oval is not surrounded by housing and permission to build the lights was easily obtained as they were ruled to have minimal impact on the local residents. The first game played under lights on 9 April 2011 saw South defeat [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]] in front of 2,630. The record night attendance at the oval was set just a few weeks later in Round 4 of the 2011 SANFL season when 2,700 saw the clash between the Panthers and [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]].\n\n==Club records==\n*Record Attendance at [[Hickinbotham Oval]]: 10,123 v [[Glenelg Tigers|Glenelg]] in Round 8, 1995\n*Record Night Attendance at [[Hickinbotham Oval]]: 2,700 v [[Port

''Solo Leveling'' has been translated to many languages by way of [[fan translations]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSince a portal connecting our world to a world full of monsters and creatures of all kinds appeared, some people have acquired powers and the ability to hunt them: they are called hunters. The protagonist of the story, Sung Jin-Woo, is the weakest of the rank E hunters and barely stronger than a normal human. He is nicknamed by his fellow hunters as \"the weakest\". One day, he and other hunters find themselves trapped in an extremely dangerous dungeon, and only a few of them survive and manage to escape. Sung Jin-Woo himself hardly survives and is the only one who completes all the trials in this dungeon. He then turns into a \"player\" who can now see an interface showing him quests. Will he succeed in becoming the most powerful hunter?\n\nThe manhwa depicts how the weakest of all the hunters grows to become the strongest there is. Hunter Sung-Woo likes clearing dungeons alone and have gained tremendous strength and magic powers in the process. The Ant arc just finished and Sung Jin-Woo was able to defeat the Ant king without even using his full strength. The main antagonist of the manhwa seems to be a demon who is working from the shadows and we expect him to be the last and final boss in the journey of hunter Sung Jin-Woo leveling up.\n\n== Media ==\n===Novel===\n{{Infobox novel\n|name       = Solo Leveling\n|author     = Chu-Gong\n|language   = Korean\n|country    = South Korea\n|genre      = Action, Fantasy\n|published  = Papyrus, [[KakaoPage]]\n|pub_date   = February 14, 2014; February 17, 2017 \u2013 October 10, 2018\n|media_type = Novel\n|isbn       = 1170336663\n}}\n''Solo Leveling'' is written by Chu-gong.

{"title_page": "FOCAL (programming language)", "text_new": "{{short description|Programming language used on DEC PDP-series machines}}\n{{For|the unrelated programming language on HP calculators|FOCAL (Hewlett-Packard)}}\n{{Infobox programming language\n| name = FOCAL\n| paradigm = \n| released = {{Start date and age|1968}}\n| developer = Richard Merrill, [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]\n| influenced by = [[JOSS]]\n| influenced = [[BASIC-PLUS]]\n| website = \n}}\n'''FOCAL''' is an interactive [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] [[programming language]] based on [[JOSS]] and primarily used on [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-series]] machines. The name is an acronym for '''F'''ormulating '''O'''n-Line '''C'''alculations in '''A'''lgebraic '''L'''anguage.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=1.1}}\n\nFOCAL is very similar to JOSS in terms of the commands it supports and the general syntax of the language. It differs in that many of JOSS' advanced features like [[Range (computer programming)|ranges]] and [[user-defined function]]s were removed to simplify the parser. Some of the keywords were renamed so that they all start with a unique first letter. This allows users to type in programs using single-character statements, further reducing memory needs. This was an important consideration on the [[PDP-8]], which was often limited to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB).\n\nLike JOSS, and later BASICs, FOCAL on the PDP-8 was a complete environment that included a line editor, the interpreter, and input/output routines. The package as a whole was called '''FOCAL-8''', which also ran on the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. When ported to the [[PDP-11]], the resulting '''FOCAL-11''' relied on the underlying [[operating system]], [[RT-11]], to provide file support and editing. The language definition was updated twice, to '''FOCAL-69''' and a very slightly modified '''FOCAL-71'''. A port to the [[Intel 8080]] was also available.\n\nFOCAL is historically notable as the language for the original versions of the early [[video game]]s [[Hamurabi (video game)|''Hamurabi'']] and [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']]. Both were later ported to BASIC where they became much more famous.<ref name=\"TIME\">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |title=Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=McCracken |first=Harry |date=2014-04-29 |access-date=2016-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205214236/http://time.com/69316/basic/ |archive-date=2016-02-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> FOCAL was not popular outside the PDP platform and largely disappeared during the move to the [[VAX-11]]. It had a strong revival in the [[Soviet Union]] where PDP-11 clones were used as educational and [[home computer]]s.\n\n==History==\n=== JOSS ===\n[[JOSS]] was released in May 1963 on the one-off [[JOHNNIAC]] computer at [[RAND Corporation]]. Within RAND, use grew rapidly, and the machine, originally constructed in 1953, quickly ran out of capability. JOHNNIAC retired in 1966 and JOSS moved to a newly purchased [[PDP-6]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s (DEC) first \"big\" machine. Usage continued to grow and by 1970 the system was being used by 500 to 600 users across the country and had spawned a number of innovations such as mobile [[computer terminal]]s that could be wheeled from room to room and plugged in for instant access.<ref name=rand>{{cite techreport |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R918.pdf |title=The JOSS Years: Reflections on an experiment |first=Shirley |last=Marks |date=December 1971 |publisher=Rand}}</ref>\n\nJOSS was extremely influential in the computer field. It emerged just as the [[time-sharing]] concept was being introduced and there was significant interest in man-machine interaction and computers were seeing more widespread use. Whereas most timeshare [[operating system]]s of the era concentrated on user account and file management, leaving the users on their own when it came to programming, JOSS provided these functions and an easily used programming language in a single package. RAND showed the system to a parade of people in the industry.<ref name=rand/>\n\n===FOCAL===\nPorts of JOSS to other platforms began to appear shortly after the PDP-6 version was released. FOCAL was one example of its many offshoots.\n\nWritten by [[Richard Merrill]], FOCAL removed features as required in order to be able to run in the much more limited memory space of the [[PDP-8]] and other 12-bit machines in the DEC lineup. To achieve this, a major change was made to reduce the amount of temporary data, or \"[[State (computer science)|state]]\", needed to parse the statements. One noticeable effect of this decision was that [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]] could only be used for [[Branch (computer science)|branches]], in contrast to JOSS, where conditionals can be applied to any statement.\n\nThe other noticeable change was to rearrange the keywords so each started with a unique letter. This simplified the [[Parsing|parser]], which needed to read only the first letter of the command on a line of code, and could then skip forward to the next blank. In contrast, JOSS had to continue reading until it had read the entire command word, and then compare that against a list containing complete words. Users could save memory by typing in only that letter, reducing the size of the [[source code]].\n\nThe first version of FOCAL was released in 1968 for the [[PDP-8]]. An updated version followed the next year, which was later known as FOCAL-69. The system as a whole, regardless of version, was known as FOCAL-8 when it was ported to other machines in the 12-bit series, including the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. It was popular as it was highly efficient in terms of memory use, which was often severely limited on these machines to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB). The similar FOCAL-11 ran on the [[PDP-11]] under [[RT-11]].\n\n[[Processor Technology]] also offered a version of 8k FOCAL, complete with Lunar Lander, for the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]] system. This was provided for the copying charge of the tape, while the [[source code]] was provided for free with other purchases.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1976-04/page/n49 |title=Watch Your Altair Grow! |magazine=Byte |date=April 1976 |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===BASIC===\nWhile FOCAL was becoming popular on DEC machines, BASIC was becoming a more popular alternative on other platforms. By the late 1960s, a number of companies were making inroads in DEC's minicomputer stronghold selling similar machines running timeshared versions of BASIC. Notable among these was the [[HP 2100]] series, running [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]].{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\n[[David H. Ahl]] had recently joined DEC's PDP-8 Group, just as the company became interested in selling the machine into educational settings. Due to the popularity of BASIC in the educational market, especially with the growing library of BASIC programs from the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]], Ahl found selling the machine with FOCAL was difficult in spite of its advantages.{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}} As he later noted:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | |DEC's FOCAL language was equal to BASIC in most aspects and even better in some, but it had one huge drawback: DEC was unwilling to license it to other computer manufacturers. FOCAL was fighting an uphill battle against BASIC, which was available on GE, Honeywell, HP, and other computers.<br /><br />I think it wound up with a situation like Sony and Betamax. Sony saying, \"Betamax is ours and it is a better format than VHS,\" which it was. But then, JVC saying, \"We have VHS and Toshiba. Hey, do you want to use it? Fine, we'll license it to you for next to nothing.\"{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}}}\n\nAhl took it upon himself to produce a BASIC system for the platform, hiring a company he later learned was a single programmer in Brooklyn to produce a version for the 4&nbsp;kWord PDP-8. DEC began selling packaged versions of the PDP-8 with terminals and the BASIC as the \"EduSystem\" lineup, with larger systems in the series having expanded versions of BASIC, and in some cases, FOCAL and [[FORTRAN]] as well. Some PDP-11 based EduSystems were also created.<ref name=edu>{{cite book |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp8/tss8/EduSystemHandbookJan73.pdf |title=EduSystem Handbook |page=V |publisher=Digital |date=1973}}</ref>\n\nAhl then began porting programs from FOCAL to BASIC, notably [[Hamurabi (video game)|''The Sumer Game'']] (which he renamed ''Hamurabi''), a version of [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']], and a number of smaller FOCAL demos. Combining his ports with submissions from outside programmers, he managed to collect enough material to have DEC publish ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' in 1973. The book was an immediate success and ultimately ran through three printings to 1975.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s BASIC was a standard feature of all DEC machines and FOCAL use evaporated.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\n===Rebirth in the Soviet Union===\nThe PDP-11 had been cloned in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s for military purposes. In the 1980s, single-chip variations similar to the [[LSI-11]] were produced that gave rise to a series of PDP-11 compatible [[home computer]]s. Most notable among several models were the [[Electronika BK]] series, released in 1985. These were initially supplied with FOCAL on a [[ROM cartridge]],<ref>{{cite techreport|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1988-802-8-Stapleton.pdf |title=The Soviet Union and the Personal Computer \"Revolution\" |page=8 |first1=R.A. |last1=Stapleton |first2=S.E. |last2=Goodman |date=June 1988 |publisher=University of Arizona}}</ref> while a BASIC cartridge was an optional add-on. Later models supplied BASIC by default.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oldcomputermuseum.com/elektronika_bk0010.html |title=Elektronika BK-0010 |website=Old Computer Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe following description is based on FOCAL-69 as seen in the FOCAL-8 language reference manual.{{sfn|Manual|1968}}\n\n===Direct and indirect modes===\nFOCAL followed the JOSS model for interaction via a [[command line interface]]. This allowed users to type in commands in \"direct mode\", which were performed immediately, or to prefix them with a line number, in which case they were added to the program if they were unique, or overrode existing code if the same number had previously been used.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\nThe method of operation is similar to BASIC's \"immediate mode\" vs. \"program mode\". It contrasts with JOSS, in which all commands, both program and direct, were saved and loaded as part of the user's workspace. This allowed JOSS to have commands without line numbers, which they used for {{code|Form}} definitions and other tasks. FOCAL lacked this capability, so those instructions that needed to be loaded and saved became options on other program-mode commands like {{code|Type}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\n===Program statements===\nEvery line in a FOCAL program must start with a line number. As with JOSS, line numbers are fixed-point numbers consisting of two two-digit integers separated by a period. In FOCAL-8, valid line numbers range from 1.01 through 31.99. When printed out, using {{code|WRITE}}, the FOCAL equivalent to BASIC's {{code|LIST}}, leading zeros will be added so that all line numbers. This means all line numbers will be a total of five characters including the period; 1.10 will be printed as {{code|01.10}}. Statements referring to those lines do not need the leading zeros, for instance, {{code|GOTO 1.10}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nThe number on the left of the period is known as the \"group number\". Groups provide some level of code organization that is lacking in languages like Fortran or BASIC. The primary use of these was to use a group as a [[subroutine]] which can be called with {{code|DO}}, for instance, {{code|DO 5}} which will jump to the subroutine written in group 5. The editor also used these during edit-time, for instance, one could {{code|WRITE 2}} to produce a listing of the code in group 2, or {{code|ERASE 4}} to delete all of the lines in group 4.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nEvery line must start with a command keyword following the line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}} There is no concept of a \"default command\" as is the case in BASIC with its optional {{code|LET}} statement. Multiple statements can be placed on a single line, separated by semicolons. Usually, the behavior is no different than if the statements had been on separate lines, except in the case of FOR loops.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n\n=== Commands ===\n====ASK====\nThe {{code|ASK}} command (abbreviation A) will take a list of strings and variables, echo the strings and store the user input in variables.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|INPUT}}.\n\n 01.01 ASK \"NAME\", NAME\n 01.02 ASK \"COORDINATES\", X, Y\n 01.03 ASK \"A1\",A1,\"OMEGA\",W,\"T0\",T0,\"DAMPING FACTOR\",DAMPINGFACTOR\n\nIf the user doesn't enter a number but enters text, the system will convert the initial character to a number with \"A\"=1, \"B\"=2, etc.\n\n====COMMENT====\nThe {{code|COMMENT}} command (abbreviation C) creates a remark.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|REM}}.\n 01.01 COMMENT: THE SUMER GAME, BY RICHARD MERRILL\n\n====DO====\nThe {{code|DO}} command (abbreviation D) branches execution to a subroutine. It is the equivalent of BASIC's {{code|GOSUB}}. The subroutine is referenced either by group number or line number. If a line number is provided, that single line is run and then returns to the statement after the {{code|DO}}. If no line number is provided, execution starts at the first line of the block and continues until the end of the block is reached or a {{code|RETURN}} is encountered. {{code|RETURN}} is only required to return early from the group, it is not needed at the end of the group.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}}\n 01.15 DO 7.24\n 01.16 DO 8\n\n====FOR====\nThe {{code|FOR}} command (abbreviation F) implements a [[for loop]]. When three arguments are specified, the first is the initial value of the loop variable, the second is the increment, and the third value is the terminating value for the loop. If two values are provided, the first is the initial value and the second is the terminating value, and the increment is set to 1.\n\nIn contrast to other parts of the language where multiple statements on a line are independent, the {{code|FOR}} always runs the statements that follow it on the line before the termination has been met, and then continues to the next line. Thus, loops have to be on a single line, or alternately, call a subroutine with {{code|DO}}. There is no equivalent of BASIC's {{code|NEXT}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n 01.01 FOR X=1,10; TYPE X,!\n 01.02 FOR X=0,10,100; DO 2\n\nA sample FOR loop:\n 01.10 ASK \"HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW ?\",PRINCIPAL\n 01.20 ASK \"FOR HOW MANY YEARS ?\",TERM\n 01.30 FOR RATE=4.0,.5,10;DO 2.0\n 01.40 QUIT\n 02.10 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n 02.20 TYPE \"RATE\",RATE,\"   \",\"INTEREST\",INTEREST,!\n\n====GOTO====\nThe {{code|GOTO}} command (abbreviation G) jumps program execution to the specified line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}} It is identical to the same-named statement in BASIC. In FOCAL, {{code|GOTO}} is also used to begin execution, like BASIC's {{code|RUN}}, but in this usage, the documentation refers to it as {{code|GO}} instead of {{code|GOTO}} in spite of the underlying command being the same.\n 01.05 GOTO 1.01\n 02.90 TYPE !!,\"TRY AGAIN.\",!!!!!;GOTO 1.1\n\n====IF====\nThe {{code|IF}} command (abbreviation I) provides a conditional branch based on the sign of the expression. After the numeric expression, the IF command can take one to three line numbers. If the expression is less than zero, execution branches to the first line number;  if equal to zero, to the second line number;  if greater than zero, to the third line number. The language lacked relative operators such as greater than, equal or less than. To branch if X > 5, one must compare X - 5.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n 02.20 IF (25-25) 2.4,2.3,2.4\n 03.01 IF (X) 3.1,3.02,3.1\n\nIF could be short-formed by placing a semicolon (or end of line) beyond the first line number. For instance:\n\n 02.20 IF (X)1.8; TYPE \"Q\"\n 02.30 IF (X)1.8,2.50\n 02.40 TYPE \"P\"\n\nIn this case the test at 2.20 will cause the program to jump to line 1.8 if the test is negative, otherwise it will continue and type \"Q\" to the console. Line 2.30 will jump to 1.8 or 2.5 if the value is negative or zero, and otherwise continue to type \"P\" to the console.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n\n====QUIT====\nThe {{code|QUIT}} command (abbreviation Q) terminates execution of the program and returns control to the editing environment.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|STOP}} or {{code|END}}.\n 01.10 FOR X=-10,1,10;TYPE X\n 01.20 QUIT\n\n====RETURN====\nThe {{code|RETURN}} command (abbreviation R) branches execution from a subroutine back to the calling location.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} The use of {{code|RETURN}} is optional at the last line of a subroutine, a subroutine returns at the last line in the group anyway. The following is a sample subroutine for converting a yes/no prompt into a value.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n 22.78 COMMENT: 'YES OR NO' SUBROUTINE\n 22.80 ASK \"ANSWER YES OR NO ?  \",AN\n 22.82 IF (AN-0YES)22.84,22.86\n 22.84 IF (AN-0NO)22.8,22.88,22.8\n 22.86 SET X=2;RETURN\n 22.88 SET X=1;RETURN\n\n====SET====\nThe {{code|SET}} command (abbreviation S) assigns the results of an expression to the specified variable.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.3}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|LET}}.\n 01.30 SET PI=3.14156\n 01.60 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n\n====TYPE ====\nThe {{code|TYPE}} command (abbreviation T) provides for output of one or more items separated by commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.1}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|PRINT}}.\n\nItems can be variables, literal strings surrounded by double-quotes, or a variety of control characters. The control characters include the {{code|!}} to output a carriage return and line feed, {{code|#}} for the carriage return alone, and {{code|:}} for a tab character. Control characters can be strung together, for instance, {{code|!!!}} will output three CR/LFs without the need to separate them with commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n\n TYPE [NUMBERS, E1, \"TEXT\", !, #, :, $ OR %] ...OUTPUT\n 01.10 TYPE \"HI THERE, GOOD LOOKING.

The default format was {{code|%8.4}}, meaning a maximum of eight digits and four to the right of the period.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.2}} So, for instance:\n\n SET A=67823\n TYPE %6.01,A\n =  67823.0\n TYPE %5,A\n = 67823\n TYPE %8.03,A\n =   67823.000\n TYPE %,A\n = 6.7823E4\n\nNote the extra leading spaces in some examples, padding out the full defined width. Using % alone caused the output to be printed in \"floating point format\" using the E.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.3}}\n\nA special control character was {{code|$}} which caused a table of all defined variables and their values to be printed. Only the first two letters of the name will be printed, padded with a zero if need be. Arrays elements are printed on separate lines and variables with only one element will be indexed (00). For example:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.5}}\n\n TYPE $\n A0(00)=67823\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariable names may start with any letter except F (F is reserved for functions) and may contain any sequence of letters and numbers. However, only the first two characters are significant. For instance, the following code sample from ''FOCAL: A New Conversational Language''<ref>{{cite book |title=FOCAL: A New Conversational Language |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/focal69.html |publisher=Digital}}</ref> refers to the same variable as DESTINATION and then DES. Internally, both references refer to a variable designated DE:\n 01.80 ASK DESTINATION\n 02.30 IF (DES-14) 2.4,3.1,2.4\n\nAny variable may be treated as an array, allowing subscripts from -2048 through 2047.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n\n=== Math ===\nFOCAL-69 contained only five mathematical operators:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n* {{code|^}} for exponents - the exponent is converted to a 12-bit integer\n* {{code|*}} for multiplication\n* {{code|/}} for division\n* {{code|+}} for addition\n* {{code|-}} for subtraction\n\nOne curiosity of FOCAL was that the operators all had independent precedence, as in the order above. That means that the formula {{code|SET T{{=}}2-3+1}}, it would be evaluated in the order 2-(3+1) and thus produce -2. This was very different than most languages, where the + and - had equal precedence and would be evaluated (2-3)+1 to produce 0.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} This can cause subtle errors when converting FOCAL source code to other systems.\n\nFOCAL was unusual in that mathematical expressions could use (), [] and <> interchangeably in matched pairs to establish precedence.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} For instance, the following is a valid expression:\n\n   01.30 SET A=<10*[5+1]*(1+5)>\n\nAll of these are the same level of precedence and read left-to-right when at the same level, so this statement will be evaluated [], then (), then <>, to produce 360.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n\nThe language contained the following built-in functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.10}}\n* {{code|FABS()}} - Absolute value\n* {{code|FATN()}} - Arctangent\n* {{code|FCOS()}} - Cosine of argument in radians\n* {{code|FEXP()}} - Natural base to the power of the argument\n* {{code|FITR()}} - Integer part of the argument\n* {{code|FLOG()}} - Naperian log\n* {{code|FRAN()}} - Random number\n* {{code|FSGN()}} - Sign of the argument; FSGN(0)=1 in FOCAL-69, but FSGN(0)=0 in FOCAL-71 as well as later versions\n* {{code|FSIN()}} - Sine of an angle given in radians\n* {{code|FSQT()}} - Square root\n\n===Other functions===\nFOCAL also included a number of special-purpose functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=A.3}}\n\n* {{code|FDIS}} took two values and plotted a dot on the screen of graphical terminals\n* {{code|FADC}} read a value from a numbered analog input and returned an integer value\n\n==Environment commands==\n====Running programs====\nFOCAL used {{code|GOTO}} in the editor to start a program. However, a rule-of-thumb was to shorten this to {{code|GO}}. This is the equivalent of {{code|RUN}} in BASIC. {{code|GOTO}} can also be used in the editor to start execution at a specified line.\n\n====Editing commands====\nNew lines are entered into the program by simply beginning the command with a line number.  The editing commands were ERASE (abbreviation E),{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} MODIFY (abbreviation M){{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.8}} and WRITE (abbreviation W):{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n* <code>ERASE</code> - zeroes out all variables. this is sometimes found within programs to reset them\n* <code>ERASE ''line number''</code> - deletes the statement at the specified line\n* <code>ERASE ''group number''</code> - deletes all statements in the specified group\n* <code>ERASE ALL</code> - deletes the entire program\n* <code>MODIFY ''line number''</code> - allows the programmer to edit the specified line\n* <code>WRITE ''line number''</code> - display the statement at the specified line\n* <code>WRITE ''group number''</code> - display all statements in the specified group\n* <code>WRITE ALL</code> - display the specified program\n\n====File commands====\nThe file command was OPEN (abbreviation O):\n* {{code|OPEN INPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to read from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN OUTPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to write from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE INPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume input\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE OUTPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume output\n* {{code|OUTPUT CLOSE}} - output the buffer and close the file\n\n====Library commands====\nFOCAL included the ability to manage collections of FOCAL programs as a code library. Programs could call other programs in a chain fashion using {{code|LIBRARY CALL}}, or call a single subroutine in another program using {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB}}. Program names could be six characters long. The LIBRARY command (abbreviation L) had the following sub-commands:\n\n* <code>LIBRARY DELETE [device:]''program name></code> - delete a program\n* <code>LIBRARY LIST [device:][file name]</code> - catalog\n* <code>LIBRARY RUN [device:]''program name'' [line number]</code> - chain the program, optionally resuming at the specified line number\n* <code>LIBRARY SAVE [device:]''program name''</code> - save the program\n* <code>LIBRARY EXIT</code> - return to the PDP-8 monitor program\nFOCAL-71 added:\n* <code>LIBRARY CALL [device:]''program name''</code> - load a program\n* <code>LIBRARY GOSUB [device:]''program name'' [group number]</code> - call a subroutine in an external program\n\n==Error codes==\nSince the interpreter lacked sufficient memory space to store error messages, or even a table of error numbers, FOCAL used a workaround by reporting the address of the error-detecting code as a fixed-point number. For example, the [[division by zero]] error was detected it would report {{code|?28.73 @ 01.10}}, where 28.73 represents the code checking for this error at memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words, and 01.10 is the line number where the error occurred. Pages in the PDP-8 were 128 bytes long, so this address translates to location 3657.\n\n==Changes between versions==\nDEC released three versions of FOCAL for the PDP-8 series, the original, known simply as FOCAL, and two updated versions, \nFOCAL,1969 and FOCAL,1971. FOCAL,1969 was largely identical to the original, but FOCAL,1971 was major update that added file handling, new mathematics, and a variety of other changes. In contrast to the first two versions, which were stand-alone systems, FOCAL,1971 was based on the emerging [[OS/8]] (then still known as PS/8) and relied more heavily on that operating system for file handling and editing.\n\n===FOCAL,1971===\nOne change in the new version was a 10-digit math package for added precision. The {{code|FSGN}} function now returned zero if the input expression evaluated to zero. Previously this would return one. The {{code|FRAN}} now used a better algorithm that produced more randomly distributed numbers. It also added the new {{code|FIN}} function that took a string and returned its [[ASCII]] value (akin to BASIC's {{code|ASC}}) and {{code|FOUT}} which took a number and returned a string with that ASCII character ({{code|CHR}}.\n\nAs all of these options used up limited memory, when started, FOCAL,1971 entered a dialog that asked the user what features they wanted to use.\n\n==Comparison with JOSS==\nFOCUL is, for all intents, a cleaned-up version of JOSS with changes to make the syntax terser and easier to parse. Almost all FOCAL commands have a one-to-one correspondence with JOSS and differ only in details. A few features of JOSS were missing in FOCAL.\n\nOne major difference is that JOSS included a complete set of comparison operations and a [[boolean logic]] system that operated within if and for constructs. Furthermore, the ifs and loops could be applied to any statement, in contrast to FOCAL, where the only operation either could carry out was the equivalent to a goto. For instance, in JOSS, one could:\n\n  1.10 Type A if X>10.\n  1.20 Type i for i=1(1)10.\n\nWhich would optionally print A based on the test, and then print the numbers 1 to 10. In contrast, FOCAL lacked the ability to compare values, and loops were applied by skipping to the next line when they completed. The equivalent code in FOCAL would be:\n\n 1.10 IF (X-10) ,,1.30\n 1.20 TYPE A!\n 1.30 FOR I=1,1,10;TYPE I,!\n\nJOSS' implementation makes common constructs easier to build and more closely match the programmer's intentions, at the cost of making the runtime more complex. For instance, JOSS allowed ranges in loops to be described in a flexible fashion, for instance, 1,2,3,10(5)50,75,78. This flexibility comes at a cost; in FOCAL the start, stop and step can be written down in a custom in-memory structure and easily updated as the loop is performed. In contrast, the JOSS system requires a pointer to what might be, but often isn't, a more complex expression that has to be stepped over with more complex parsing code.\n\nIn terms of making the code terser, changes were relatively minor. For instance, JOSS' {{code|Do part 20.}} becomes the slightly smaller FOCAL {{code|DO 20}}, while {{code|Do step 20.1}} becomes {{code|DO 20.1}}. Command keywords were also shortened where possible, so JOSS' {{code|Demand}} becomes FOCAL's {{code|ASK}}, both to make it shorter as well as allow the letter D to be uniquely used for {{code|DO}}. The period needed to indicate the end of a line in JOSS was removed.\n\nTo simplify the parser, some FOCAL options were removed. For instance, JOSS could perform multiple assignments with {{code|Set S{{=}}P, P{{=}}Q, Q{{=}}S.}} while in FOCAL these had to be made individual statements, {{code|SET S{{=}}P; SET P{{=}}Q; SET Q{{=}}S}}. Likewise, JOSS' {{code|Form}}, used to format output, was combined into FOCAL's {{code|TYPE}} with the {{code|%}}.\n\n==Comparison with BASIC==\nComparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were inevitable since both languages were common on [[minicomputer]]s of the same era, and the two languages have much in common in terms of syntax and structure. In most cases, there is a direct conversion of FOCAL code to and from BASIC. For instance, to ask the user to input a value, in FOCAL one would:\n\n  ASK \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nwhile in BASIC the equivalent is:\n\n  INPUT \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nWith the exception of a few features that were missing from one or the other, and some relatively minor differences in syntax, the two languages are very similar.\n\nOne notable exception is the {{code|IF}} in BASIC, which allowed any statement to be placed after the {{code|THEN}}, making it more similar with JOSS' control structures. BASIC reversed the ordering of the code compared to JOSS, placing the conditional expression at the start of the line rather than the end; in BASIC one uses {{code|IF this THEN that}} as opposed to {{code|that IF this}} in JOSS. BASIC's version has the advantage that the runtime could immediately abort reading the rest of the statement if the expression was not true. In contrast, FOCAL's {{code|IF}} was more like BASIC's [[computed goto]], {{code|ON X GOTO 10,20,30}}, but the {{code|ON...GOTO}} allowed any number of lines as targets, as opposed to only three for negative, zero and positive as in JOSS and FOCAL.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is that FOCAL lacked inherent support for [[string (computer science)|strings]] as data elements that could be assigned to variables. As was the case in early BASICs or FORTRAN versions before the addition of strings (in F77), this limitation was generally avoided through the use of literal strings in input and output commands. It was only when one had to manipulate individual strings or characters within them that this became a significant problem.\n\nAs string variables were not supported, inputting a string used a [[kludge]] that converted any characters typed in by the user to their numeric character value. For example, if one typed \"HELLO\" at an input statement, FOCAL would convert the H to \"8\", the numeric value of \"H\" in the PDP-8's [[six-bit character code]]s (\"H\" is the eighth letter). It would then interpret the \"E\" as starting an exponent, then it would try to compute \"8\" to the \"LLO\" power, which would take several seconds of CPU time and result in a value of 0.76593020E+103, not a particularly helpful response. Nevertheless, by asking questions that would be responded to using single-letter responses, like {{code|Do you need instructions, Y or N\"}}, programmers could test the result against known character values to produce what looked like character input.\n\nFOCAL's PDP-8 implementation used a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] representation that represented numbers as four 12-bit words, forty-eight bits in total, with thirty-six bits of mantissa and twelve bits of exponent. This allowed for both significantly higher precision and a significantly wider range of values than most contemporary interpreters, making FOCAL a reasonable choice for serious numerical work. This high precision, and good choices for default decimal output formatting, meant that difficulties with binary-to-decimal rounding were not evident to beginning users. For comparison, [[Microsoft BASIC]] initially used a [[Microsoft Binary Format|32-bit format]], while later versions expanded this to 40-bits. Most BASICs had problems with rounding that led to simple equations resulting in tiny non-zero remainders.\n\nIt is generally agreed that FOCAL was more efficient in its use of resources than comparable BASIC systems. On a typical machine of the day, often with 6 to 24 kilobytes of [[magnetic-core memory]], FOCAL could handle larger and more complex programming tasks than BASIC.\n\n== Versions and spinoffs ==\nThe Coca-Cola Corporation used a customized version of FOCAL called COKE.\n\nFOCAL was later implemented on the PDP-7, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, PDP-5 and LINC-8.\n\nThe FOCAL manual showed how to add commands to the FOCAL parser, so many sites added specialized commands for operating custom hardware.\n\nThe [[DECUS|Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society]] collected many patches and enhancements for FOCAL. There were even major enhanced offshoots of FOCAL, such as FOCAL-W, which added many features, including better mass storage file I/O and even virtual variable memory.\n\nIn [[Russia]], it saw use as late as the early 1990s in mass-produced home computers of the [[Electronika BK]] series.\n\n==Example code==\nThe original Lunar Lander makes an excellent example for examining FOCAL code, as it uses most of the features of the language.

This was almost universal in FOCAL programs (and JOSS), as the line number scheme made such constructs easy to use. This program uses nine routines. The first, group 1, simply prints out the instructions using the {{code|T}}ype statement and sets the initial values for the run. The mass of fuel is not recorded directly, instead, it uses the current {{code|M}}ass and empty mass, {{code|N}}, so the remaining fuel is M-N and the lander runs out of fuel when M-N is 0. Also note the {{code|E}}rase at the end of line 1.20, which resets all the variable values.\n\nThe main game loop is driven by group 2. As the code \"falls\" through group 1 into group 2 during the first run, the initial values are printed out in the first two lines. Near the end of line 2.20, the user is {{code|A}}sked to input the burn rate as {{code|K}}, and then the loop timer is reset using {{code|S T{{=}}10}}. Line 2.70 tests the user's input against several possibilities, if it is over 200 or below 8 it types \"NOT POSSIBLE\" and a row of periods, and then loops back to ask the user to try again. If the value is between these values, it jumps forward to group 3. Note that the limited capabilities of FOCAL's {{code|IF}} command are evident here, in BASIC this could be reduced to a single {{code|IF K>200 OR K<8 THEN...}}\n\nGroup 3 first tests to see if the fuel has run out, and jumps to group 4 if it has. Then it tests if the 10-second period in {{code|T}} has expired and, if so, loops back to print everything out again, which has the side-effect of resetting T and S to 10. Line 3.40 tests to see if the amount of fuel burned this period, S*K, will reduce the mass of the vehicle as a whole, S*K-M, beyond the empty weight, N. If not, it moves on, if it will, it instead sets the loop timer to the amount of time the remaining fuel will burn, thus ending the loop early. In either case, it calls group 9 to update the velocity and position. It then loops over groups 7, 8 and 9 until the value of I converges.\n\nWhen the 10-second timer runs out, or it reaches the end due to the fuel test in line 3.10 or the altitude test in 7.10. In the latter cases, it will jump to group 4 and fall through to group 5, or jump to group 5 directly. Group 5 types the end-of-game results and then asks the user if they'd like to try again. If so, it jumps to 1.20 to clear out all values and print the headers again, if not if falls through to 5.98 and {{code|Q}}uits.\n\n==See also==\n*[[JOSS]], the Rand language that inspired FOCAL\n*[[MUMPS]], a data-manipulation language based on JOSS and FOCAL concepts\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n |title=FOCAL Programming Manual \n |publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation \n |date=1968 \n |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/www.computer.museum.uq.edu.au/pdf/DEC-08-AJAB-D%20PDP-8-I%20FOCAL%20Programming%20Manual.pdf \n|ref=CITEREFManual1968\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/216469/A_basic_history_of_BASIC_on_its_50th_birthday.php\n |title=A basic history of BASIC on its 50th birthday\n |website=Gamasutra\n |date=1 May 2014\n |first=John |last=Szczepaniak\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite interview\n |first=Kevin |last=Savetz\n |date=April 2013\n |title=Dave Ahl and Betsy Ahl\n |url=https://computingpioneers.com/index.php?title=Dave_Ahl_and_Betsy_Ahl\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[ftp://ftp.pdp8.net/software/games/focal/ FOCAL source code], FOCAL source for several programs, including Lunar Lander, Sumer Game, and others\n*[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/ DEC's FOCAL 1969 Promotional Booklet]\n*[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/ The Computer History Simulation Project (Focal is available as a free download here)]\n*ftp://www.cozx.com/pub/langs/focal.tar.gz C-source version that runs under several operating systems, including Linux\n*[http://www.catb.org/retro the C-source for a modern DOS version suitable for teaching]  \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525101809/http://www.libex.ru/detail/book91959.html Abramov V.A.

The name is an acronym for '''F'''ormulating '''O'''n-Line '''C'''alculations in '''A'''lgebraic '''L'''anguage.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=1.1}}\n\nFOCAL is very similar to JOSS in terms of the commands it supports and the general syntax of the language. It differs in that many of JOSS' advanced features like [[Range (computer programming)|ranges]] and [[user-defined function]]s were removed to simplify the parser. Some of the keywords were renamed so that they all start with a unique first letter. This allows users to type in programs using single-character statements, further reducing memory needs. This was an important consideration on the [[PDP-8]], which was often limited to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB).\n\nLike JOSS, and later BASICs, FOCAL on the PDP-8 was a complete environment that included a line editor, the interpreter, and input/output routines. The package as a whole was called '''FOCAL-8''', which also ran on the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. When ported to the [[PDP-11]], the resulting '''FOCAL-11''' relied on the underlying [[operating system]], [[RT-11]], to provide file support and editing. The language definition was updated twice, to '''FOCAL-69''' and a very slightly modified '''FOCAL-71'''. A port to the [[Intel 8080]] was also available.\n\nFOCAL is historically notable as the language for the original versions of the early [[video game]]s [[Hamurabi (video game)|''Hamurabi'']] and [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']]. Both were later ported to BASIC where they became much more famous.<ref name=\"TIME\">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |title=Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=McCracken |first=Harry |date=2014-04-29 |access-date=2016-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205214236/http://time.com/69316/basic/ |archive-date=2016-02-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> FOCAL was not popular outside the PDP platform and largely disappeared during the move to the [[VAX-11]]. It had a strong revival in the [[Soviet Union]] where PDP-11 clones were used as educational and [[home computer]]s.\n\n==History==\n=== JOSS ===\n[[JOSS]] was released in May 1963 on the one-off [[JOHNNIAC]] computer at [[RAND Corporation]]. Within RAND, use grew rapidly, and the machine, originally constructed in 1953, quickly ran out of capability. JOHNNIAC retired in 1966 and JOSS moved to a newly purchased [[PDP-6]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s (DEC) first \"big\" machine. Usage continued to grow and by 1970 the system was being used by 500 to 600 users across the country and had spawned a number of innovations such as mobile [[computer terminal]]s that could be wheeled from room to room and plugged in for instant access.<ref name=rand>{{cite techreport |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R918.pdf |title=The JOSS Years: Reflections on an experiment |first=Shirley |last=Marks |date=December 1971 |publisher=Rand}}</ref>\n\nJOSS was extremely influential in the computer field. It emerged just as the [[time-sharing]] concept was being introduced and there was significant interest in man-machine interaction and computers were seeing more widespread use. Whereas most timeshare [[operating system]]s of the era concentrated on user account and file management, leaving the users on their own when it came to programming, JOSS provided these functions and an easily used programming language in a single package. RAND showed the system to a parade of people in the industry.<ref name=rand/>\n\n===FOCAL===\nPorts of JOSS to other platforms began to appear shortly after the PDP-6 version was released. FOCAL was one example of its many offshoots.\n\nWritten by [[Richard Merrill]], FOCAL removed features as required in order to be able to run in the much more limited memory space of the [[PDP-8]] and other 12-bit machines in the DEC lineup. To achieve this, a major change was made to reduce the amount of temporary data, or \"[[State (computer science)|state]]\", needed to parse the statements. One noticeable effect of this decision was that [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]] could only be used for [[Branch (computer science)|branches]], in contrast to JOSS, where conditionals can be applied to any statement.\n\nThe other noticeable change was to rearrange the keywords so each started with a unique letter. This simplified the [[Parsing|parser]], which needed to read only the first letter of the command on a line of code, and could then skip forward to the next blank. In contrast, JOSS had to continue reading until it had read the entire command word, and then compare that against a list containing complete words. Users could save memory by typing in only that letter, reducing the size of the [[source code]].\n\nThe first version of FOCAL was released in 1968 for the [[PDP-8]]. An updated version followed the next year, which was later known as FOCAL-69. The system as a whole, regardless of version, was known as FOCAL-8 when it was ported to other machines in the 12-bit series, including the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-12]]. It was popular as it was highly efficient in terms of memory use, which was often severely limited on these machines to a few [[kilobyte]]s (KB). The similar FOCAL-11 ran on the [[PDP-11]] under [[RT-11]].\n\n[[Processor Technology]] also offered a version of 8k FOCAL, complete with Lunar Lander, for the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]] system. This was provided for the copying charge of the tape, while the [[source code]] was provided for free with other purchases.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1976-04/page/n49 |title=Watch Your Altair Grow! |magazine=Byte |date=April 1976 |page=48}}</ref>\n\n===BASIC===\nWhile FOCAL was becoming popular on DEC machines, BASIC was becoming a more popular alternative on other platforms. By the late 1960s, a number of companies were making inroads in DEC's minicomputer stronghold selling similar machines running timeshared versions of BASIC. Notable among these was the [[HP 2100]] series, running [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]].{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\n[[David H. Ahl]] had recently joined DEC's PDP-8 Group, just as the company became interested in selling the machine into educational settings. Due to the popularity of BASIC in the educational market, especially with the growing library of BASIC programs from the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]], Ahl found selling the machine with FOCAL was difficult in spite of its advantages.{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}} As he later noted:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | |DEC's FOCAL language was equal to BASIC in most aspects and even better in some, but it had one huge drawback: DEC was unwilling to license it to other computer manufacturers. FOCAL was fighting an uphill battle against BASIC, which was available on GE, Honeywell, HP, and other computers.<br /><br />I think it wound up with a situation like Sony and Betamax. Sony saying, \"Betamax is ours and it is a better format than VHS,\" which it was. But then, JVC saying, \"We have VHS and Toshiba. Hey, do you want to use it? Fine, we'll license it to you for next to nothing.\"{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}}}\n\nAhl took it upon himself to produce a BASIC system for the platform, hiring a company he later learned was a single programmer in Brooklyn to produce a version for the 4&nbsp;kWord PDP-8. DEC began selling packaged versions of the PDP-8 with terminals and the BASIC as the \"EduSystem\" lineup, with larger systems in the series having expanded versions of BASIC, and in some cases, FOCAL and [[FORTRAN]] as well. Some PDP-11 based EduSystems were also created.<ref name=edu>{{cite book |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp8/tss8/EduSystemHandbookJan73.pdf |title=EduSystem Handbook |page=V |publisher=Digital |date=1973}}</ref>\n\nAhl then began porting programs from FOCAL to BASIC, notably [[Hamurabi (video game)|''The Sumer Game'']] (which he renamed ''Hamurabi''), a version of [[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|''Lunar Lander'']], and a number of smaller FOCAL demos. Combining his ports with submissions from outside programmers, he managed to collect enough material to have DEC publish ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' in 1973. The book was an immediate success and ultimately ran through three printings to 1975.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}{{sfn|Szczepaniak|2014}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s BASIC was a standard feature of all DEC machines and FOCAL use evaporated.{{sfn|Savetz|2013}}\n\n===Rebirth in the Soviet Union===\nThe PDP-11 had been cloned in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s for military purposes. In the 1980s, single-chip variations similar to the [[LSI-11]] were produced that gave rise to a series of PDP-11 compatible [[home computer]]s. Most notable among several models were the [[Electronika BK]] series, released in 1985. These were initially supplied with FOCAL on a [[ROM cartridge]],<ref>{{cite techreport|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1988-802-8-Stapleton.pdf |title=The Soviet Union and the Personal Computer \"Revolution\" |page=8 |first1=R.A. |last1=Stapleton |first2=S.E. |last2=Goodman |date=June 1988 |publisher=University of Arizona}}</ref> while a BASIC cartridge was an optional add-on. Later models supplied BASIC by default.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oldcomputermuseum.com/elektronika_bk0010.html |title=Elektronika BK-0010 |website=Old Computer Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe following description is based on FOCAL-69 as seen in the FOCAL-8 language reference manual.{{sfn|Manual|1968}}\n\n===Direct and indirect modes===\nFOCAL followed the JOSS model for interaction via a [[command line interface]]. This allowed users to type in commands in \"direct mode\", which were performed immediately, or to prefix them with a line number, in which case they were added to the program if they were unique, or overrode existing code if the same number had previously been used.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\nThe method of operation is similar to BASIC's \"immediate mode\" vs. \"program mode\". It contrasts with JOSS, in which all commands, both program and direct, were saved and loaded as part of the user's workspace. This allowed JOSS to have commands without line numbers, which they used for {{code|Form}} definitions and other tasks. FOCAL lacked this capability, so those instructions that needed to be loaded and saved became options on other program-mode commands like {{code|Type}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.1}}\n\n===Program statements===\nEvery line in a FOCAL program must start with a line number. As with JOSS, line numbers are fixed-point numbers consisting of two two-digit integers separated by a period. In FOCAL-8, valid line numbers range from 1.01 through 31.99. When printed out, using {{code|WRITE}}, the FOCAL equivalent to BASIC's {{code|LIST}}, leading zeros will be added so that all line numbers. This means all line numbers will be a total of five characters including the period; 1.10 will be printed as {{code|01.10}}. Statements referring to those lines do not need the leading zeros, for instance, {{code|GOTO 1.10}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nThe number on the left of the period is known as the \"group number\". Groups provide some level of code organization that is lacking in languages like Fortran or BASIC. The primary use of these was to use a group as a [[subroutine]] which can be called with {{code|DO}}, for instance, {{code|DO 5}} which will jump to the subroutine written in group 5. The editor also used these during edit-time, for instance, one could {{code|WRITE 2}} to produce a listing of the code in group 2, or {{code|ERASE 4}} to delete all of the lines in group 4.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}}\n\nEvery line must start with a command keyword following the line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.7}} There is no concept of a \"default command\" as is the case in BASIC with its optional {{code|LET}} statement. Multiple statements can be placed on a single line, separated by semicolons. Usually, the behavior is no different than if the statements had been on separate lines, except in the case of FOR loops.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n\n=== Commands ===\n====ASK====\nThe {{code|ASK}} command (abbreviation A) will take a list of strings and variables, echo the strings and store the user input in variables.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|INPUT}}.\n\n 01.01 ASK \"NAME\", NAME\n 01.02 ASK \"COORDINATES\", X, Y\n 01.03 ASK \"A1\",A1,\"OMEGA\",W,\"T0\",T0,\"DAMPING FACTOR\",DAMPINGFACTOR\n\nIf the user doesn't enter a number but enters text, the system will convert the initial character to a number with \"A\"=1, \"B\"=2, etc.\n\n====COMMENT====\nThe {{code|COMMENT}} command (abbreviation C) creates a remark.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|REM}}.\n 01.01 COMMENT: THE SUMER GAME, BY RICHARD MERRILL\n\n====DO====\nThe {{code|DO}} command (abbreviation D) branches execution to a subroutine. It is the equivalent of BASIC's {{code|GOSUB}}. The subroutine is referenced either by group number or line number. If a line number is provided, that single line is run and then returns to the statement after the {{code|DO}}. If no line number is provided, execution starts at the first line of the block and continues until the end of the block is reached or a {{code|RETURN}} is encountered. {{code|RETURN}} is only required to return early from the group, it is not needed at the end of the group.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}}\n 01.15 DO 7.24\n 01.16 DO 8\n\n====FOR====\nThe {{code|FOR}} command (abbreviation F) implements a [[for loop]]. When three arguments are specified, the first is the initial value of the loop variable, the second is the increment, and the third value is the terminating value for the loop. If two values are provided, the first is the initial value and the second is the terminating value, and the increment is set to 1.\n\nIn contrast to other parts of the language where multiple statements on a line are independent, the {{code|FOR}} always runs the statements that follow it on the line before the termination has been met, and then continues to the next line. Thus, loops have to be on a single line, or alternately, call a subroutine with {{code|DO}}. There is no equivalent of BASIC's {{code|NEXT}}.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.7}}\n 01.01 FOR X=1,10; TYPE X,!\n 01.02 FOR X=0,10,100; DO 2\n\nA sample FOR loop:\n 01.10 ASK \"HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW ?\",PRINCIPAL\n 01.20 ASK \"FOR HOW MANY YEARS ?\",TERM\n 01.30 FOR RATE=4.0,.5,10;DO 2.0\n 01.40 QUIT\n 02.10 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n 02.20 TYPE \"RATE\",RATE,\"   \",\"INTEREST\",INTEREST,!\n\n====GOTO====\nThe {{code|GOTO}} command (abbreviation G) jumps program execution to the specified line number.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.4}} It is identical to the same-named statement in BASIC. In FOCAL, {{code|GOTO}} is also used to begin execution, like BASIC's {{code|RUN}}, but in this usage, the documentation refers to it as {{code|GO}} instead of {{code|GOTO}} in spite of the underlying command being the same.\n 01.05 GOTO 1.01\n 02.90 TYPE !!,\"TRY AGAIN.\",!!!!!;GOTO 1.1\n\n====IF====\nThe {{code|IF}} command (abbreviation I) provides a conditional branch based on the sign of the expression. After the numeric expression, the IF command can take one to three line numbers. If the expression is less than zero, execution branches to the first line number;  if equal to zero, to the second line number;  if greater than zero, to the third line number. The language lacked relative operators such as greater than, equal or less than. To branch if X > 5, one must compare X - 5.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n 02.20 IF (25-25) 2.4,2.3,2.4\n 03.01 IF (X) 3.1,3.02,3.1\n\nIF could be short-formed by placing a semicolon (or end of line) beyond the first line number. For instance:\n\n 02.20 IF (X)1.8; TYPE \"Q\"\n 02.30 IF (X)1.8,2.50\n 02.40 TYPE \"P\"\n\nIn this case the test at 2.20 will cause the program to jump to line 1.8 if the test is negative, otherwise it will continue and type \"Q\" to the console. Line 2.30 will jump to 1.8 or 2.5 if the value is negative or zero, and otherwise continue to type \"P\" to the console.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.5}}\n\n====QUIT====\nThe {{code|QUIT}} command (abbreviation Q) terminates execution of the program and returns control to the editing environment.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|STOP}} or {{code|END}}.\n 01.10 FOR X=-10,1,10;TYPE X\n 01.20 QUIT\n\n====RETURN====\nThe {{code|RETURN}} command (abbreviation R) branches execution from a subroutine back to the calling location.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.6}} The use of {{code|RETURN}} is optional at the last line of a subroutine, a subroutine returns at the last line in the group anyway. The following is a sample subroutine for converting a yes/no prompt into a value.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n 22.78 COMMENT: 'YES OR NO' SUBROUTINE\n 22.80 ASK \"ANSWER YES OR NO ?  \",AN\n 22.82 IF (AN-0YES)22.84,22.86\n 22.84 IF (AN-0NO)22.8,22.88,22.8\n 22.86 SET X=2;RETURN\n 22.88 SET X=1;RETURN\n\n====SET====\nThe {{code|SET}} command (abbreviation S) assigns the results of an expression to the specified variable.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.3}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|LET}}.\n 01.30 SET PI=3.14156\n 01.60 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM\n\n====TYPE ====\nThe {{code|TYPE}} command (abbreviation T) provides for output of one or more items separated by commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.1}} Equivalent to BASIC's {{code|PRINT}}.\n\nItems can be variables, literal strings surrounded by double-quotes, or a variety of control characters. The control characters include the {{code|!}} to output a carriage return and line feed, {{code|#}} for the carriage return alone, and {{code|:}} for a tab character. Control characters can be strung together, for instance, {{code|!!!}} will output three CR/LFs without the need to separate them with commas.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n\n TYPE [NUMBERS, E1, \"TEXT\", !, #, :, $ OR %] ...OUTPUT\n 01.10 TYPE \"HI THERE, GOOD LOOKING.

The default format was {{code|%8.4}}, meaning a maximum of eight digits and four to the right of the period.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.2}} So, for instance:\n\n SET A=67823\n TYPE %6.01,A\n =  67823.0\n TYPE %5,A\n = 67823\n TYPE %8.03,A\n =   67823.000\n TYPE %,A\n = 6.7823E4\n\nNote the extra leading spaces in some examples, padding out the full defined width. Using % alone caused the output to be printed in \"floating point format\" using the E.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.3}}\n\nA special control character was {{code|$}} which caused a table of all defined variables and their values to be printed. Only the first two letters of the name will be printed, padded with a zero if need be. Arrays elements are printed on separate lines and variables with only one element will be indexed (00). For example:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.5}}\n\n TYPE $\n A0(00)=67823\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariable names may start with any letter except F (F is reserved for functions) and may contain any sequence of letters and numbers. However, only the first two characters are significant. For instance, the following code sample from ''FOCAL: A New Conversational Language''<ref>{{cite book |title=FOCAL: A New Conversational Language |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/focal69.html |publisher=Digital}}</ref> refers to the same variable as DESTINATION and then DES. Internally, both references refer to a variable designated DE:\n 01.80 ASK DESTINATION\n 02.30 IF (DES-14) 2.4,3.1,2.4\n\nAny variable may be treated as an array, allowing subscripts from -2048 through 2047.[http://www.pdp8.net/lang/focal/misc.shtml]\n\n=== Math ===\nFOCAL-69 contained only five mathematical operators:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n* {{code|^}} for exponents - the exponent is converted to a 12-bit integer\n* {{code|*}} for multiplication\n* {{code|/}} for division\n* {{code|+}} for addition\n* {{code|-}} for subtraction\n\nOne curiosity of FOCAL was that the operators all had independent precedence, as in the order above. That means that the formula {{code|SET T{{=}}2-3+1}}, it would be evaluated in the order 2-(3+1) and thus produce -2. This was very different than most languages, where the + and - had equal precedence and would be evaluated (2-3)+1 to produce 0.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} This can cause subtle errors when converting FOCAL source code to other systems.\n\nFOCAL was unusual in that mathematical expressions could use (), [] and <> interchangeably in matched pairs to establish precedence.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} For instance, the following is a valid expression:\n\n   01.30 SET A=<10*[5+1]*(1+5)>\n\nAll of these are the same level of precedence and read left-to-right when at the same level, so this statement will be evaluated [], then (), then <>, to produce 360.{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}}\n\nThe language contained the following built-in functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.10}}\n* {{code|FABS()}} - Absolute value\n* {{code|FATN()}} - Arctangent\n* {{code|FCOS()}} - Cosine of argument in radians\n* {{code|FEXP()}} - Natural base to the power of the argument\n* {{code|FITR()}} - Integer part of the argument\n* {{code|FLOG()}} - Naperian log\n* {{code|FRAN()}} - Random number\n* {{code|FSGN()}} - Sign of the argument; FSGN(0)=1 in FOCAL-69, but FSGN(0)=0 in FOCAL-71 as well as later versions\n* {{code|FSIN()}} - Sine of an angle given in radians\n* {{code|FSQT()}} - Square root\n\n===Other functions===\nFOCAL also included a number of special-purpose functions:{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=A.3}}\n\n* {{code|FDIS}} took two values and plotted a dot on the screen of graphical terminals\n* {{code|FADC}} read a value from a numbered analog input and returned an integer value\n\n==Environment commands==\n====Running programs====\nFOCAL used {{code|GOTO}} in the editor to start a program. However, a rule-of-thumb was to shorten this to {{code|GO}}. This is the equivalent of {{code|RUN}} in BASIC. {{code|GOTO}} can also be used in the editor to start execution at a specified line.\n\n====Editing commands====\nNew lines are entered into the program by simply beginning the command with a line number.  The editing commands were ERASE (abbreviation E),{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=2.4}} MODIFY (abbreviation M){{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.8}} and WRITE (abbreviation W):{{sfn|Manual|1968|p=3.2}}\n* <code>ERASE</code> - zeroes out all variables. this is sometimes found within programs to reset them\n* <code>ERASE ''line number''</code> - deletes the statement at the specified line\n* <code>ERASE ''group number''</code> - deletes all statements in the specified group\n* <code>ERASE ALL</code> - deletes the entire program\n* <code>MODIFY ''line number''</code> - allows the programmer to edit the specified line\n* <code>WRITE ''line number''</code> - display the statement at the specified line\n* <code>WRITE ''group number''</code> - display all statements in the specified group\n* <code>WRITE ALL</code> - display the specified program\n\n====File commands====\nThe file command was OPEN (abbreviation O):\n* {{code|OPEN INPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to read from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN OUTPUT [device:][file][,ECHO]}} - prepare to write from the start of a file\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE INPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume input\n* {{code|OPEN RESTORE OUTPUT[,ECHO]}} - resume output\n* {{code|OUTPUT CLOSE}} - output the buffer and close the file\n\n====Library commands====\nFOCAL included the ability to manage collections of FOCAL programs as a code library. Programs could call other programs in a chain fashion using {{code|LIBRARY CALL}}, or call a single subroutine in another program using {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB}}. Program names could be six characters long. The LIBRARY command (abbreviation L) had the following sub-commands:\n\n* {{code|LIBRARY DELETE [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - delete a program\n* {{code|LIBRARY LIST [device:][file name]}} - catalog\n* {{code|LIBRARY RUN [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki> [line number]}} - chain the program, optionally resuming at the specified line number\n* {{code|LIBRARY SAVE [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - save the program\n* {{code|LIBRARY EXIT}} - return to the PDP-8 monitor program\nFOCAL-71 added:\n* {{code|LIBRARY CALL [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki>}} - load a program\n* {{code|LIBRARY GOSUB [device:]<nowiki><program name></nowiki> [group number]}} - call a subroutine in an external program\n\n==Error codes==\nSince the interpreter lacked sufficient memory space to store error messages, or even a table of error numbers, FOCAL used a workaround by reporting the address of the error-detecting code as a fixed-point number. For example, the [[division by zero]] error was detected it would report {{code|?28.73 @ 01.10}}, where 28.73 represents the code checking for this error at memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words, and 01.10 is the line number where the error occurred. Pages in the PDP-8 were 128 bytes long, so this address translates to location 3657.\n\n==Changes between versions==\nDEC released three versions of FOCAL for the PDP-8 series, the original, known simply as FOCAL, and two updated versions, \nFOCAL,1969 and FOCAL,1971. FOCAL,1969 was largely identical to the original, but FOCAL,1971 was major update that added file handling, new mathematics, and a variety of other changes. In contrast to the first two versions, which were stand-alone systems, FOCAL,1971 was based on the emerging [[OS/8]] (then still known as PS/8) and relied more heavily on that operating system for file handling and editing.\n\n===FOCAL,1971===\nOne change in the new version was a 10-digit math package for added precision. The {{code|FSGN}} function now returned zero if the input expression evaluated to zero. Previously this would return one. The {{code|FRAN}} now used a better algorithm that produced more randomly distributed numbers. It also added the new {{code|FIN}} function that took a string and returned its [[ASCII]] value (akin to BASIC's {{code|ASC}}) and {{code|FOUT}} which took a number and returned a string with that ASCII character ({{code|CHR}}.\n\nAs all of these options used up limited memory, when started, FOCAL,1971 entered a dialog that asked the user what features they wanted to use.\n\n==Comparison with JOSS==\nFOCUL is, for all intents, a cleaned-up version of JOSS with changes to make the syntax terser and easier to parse. Almost all FOCAL commands have a one-to-one correspondence with JOSS and differ only in details. A few features of JOSS were missing in FOCAL.\n\nOne major difference is that JOSS included a complete set of comparison operations and a [[boolean logic]] system that operated within if and for constructs. Furthermore, the ifs and loops could be applied to any statement, in contrast to FOCAL, where the only operation either could carry out was the equivalent to a goto. For instance, in JOSS, one could:\n\n  1.10 Type A if X>10.\n  1.20 Type i for i=1(1)10.\n\nWhich would optionally print A based on the test, and then print the numbers 1 to 10. In contrast, FOCAL lacked the ability to compare values, and loops were applied by skipping to the next line when they completed. The equivalent code in FOCAL would be:\n\n 1.10 IF (X-10) ,,1.30\n 1.20 TYPE A!\n 1.30 FOR I=1,1,10;TYPE I,!\n\nJOSS' implementation makes common constructs easier to build and more closely match the programmer's intentions, at the cost of making the runtime more complex. For instance, JOSS allowed ranges in loops to be described in a flexible fashion, for instance, 1,2,3,10(5)50,75,78. This flexibility comes at a cost; in FOCAL the start, stop and step can be written down in a custom in-memory structure and easily updated as the loop is performed. In contrast, the JOSS system requires a pointer to what might be, but often isn't, a more complex expression that has to be stepped over with more complex parsing code.\n\nIn terms of making the code terser, changes were relatively minor. For instance, JOSS' {{code|Do part 20.}} becomes the slightly smaller FOCAL {{code|DO 20}}, while {{code|Do step 20.1}} becomes {{code|DO 20.1}}. Command keywords were also shortened where possible, so JOSS' {{code|Demand}} becomes FOCAL's {{code|ASK}}, both to make it shorter as well as allow the letter D to be uniquely used for {{code|DO}}. The period needed to indicate the end of a line in JOSS was removed.\n\nTo simplify the parser, some FOCAL options were removed. For instance, JOSS could perform multiple assignments with {{code|Set S{{=}}P, P{{=}}Q, Q{{=}}S.}} while in FOCAL these had to be made individual statements, {{code|SET S{{=}}P; SET P{{=}}Q; SET Q{{=}}S}}. Likewise, JOSS' {{code|Form}}, used to format output, was combined into FOCAL's {{code|TYPE}} with the {{code|%}}.\n\n==Comparison with BASIC==\nComparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were inevitable since both languages were common on [[minicomputer]]s of the same era, and the two languages have much in common in terms of syntax and structure. In most cases, there is a direct conversion of FOCAL code to and from BASIC. For instance, to ask the user to input a value, in FOCAL one would:\n\n  ASK \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nwhile in BASIC the equivalent is:\n\n  INPUT \"What is your age?\",AGE\n\nWith the exception of a few features that were missing from one or the other, and some relatively minor differences in syntax, the two languages are very similar.\n\nOne notable exception is the {{code|IF}} in BASIC, which allowed any statement to be placed after the {{code|THEN}}, making it more similar with JOSS' control structures. BASIC reversed the ordering of the code compared to JOSS, placing the conditional expression at the start of the line rather than the end; in BASIC one uses {{code|IF this THEN that}} as opposed to {{code|that IF this}} in JOSS. BASIC's version has the advantage that the runtime could immediately abort reading the rest of the statement if the expression was not true. In contrast, FOCAL's {{code|IF}} was more like BASIC's [[computed goto]], {{code|ON X GOTO 10,20,30}}, but the {{code|ON...GOTO}} allowed any number of lines as targets, as opposed to only three for negative, zero and positive as in JOSS and FOCAL.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is that FOCAL lacked inherent support for [[string (computer science)|strings]] as data elements that could be assigned to variables. As was the case in early BASICs or FORTRAN versions before the addition of strings (in F77), this limitation was generally avoided through the use of literal strings in input and output commands. It was only when one had to manipulate individual strings or characters within them that this became a significant problem.\n\nAs string variables were not supported, inputting a string used a [[kludge]] that converted any characters typed in by the user to their numeric character value. For example, if one typed \"HELLO\" at an input statement, FOCAL would convert the H to \"8\", the numeric value of \"H\" in the PDP-8's [[six-bit character code]]s (\"H\" is the eighth letter). It would then interpret the \"E\" as starting an exponent, then it would try to compute \"8\" to the \"LLO\" power, which would take several seconds of CPU time and result in a value of 0.76593020E+103, not a particularly helpful response. Nevertheless, by asking questions that would be responded to using single-letter responses, like {{code|Do you need instructions, Y or N\"}}, programmers could test the result against known character values to produce what looked like character input.\n\nFOCAL's PDP-8 implementation used a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] representation that represented numbers as four 12-bit words, forty-eight bits in total, with thirty-six bits of mantissa and twelve bits of exponent. This allowed for both significantly higher precision and a significantly wider range of values than most contemporary interpreters, making FOCAL a reasonable choice for serious numerical work. This high precision, and good choices for default decimal output formatting, meant that difficulties with binary-to-decimal rounding were not evident to beginning users. For comparison, [[Microsoft BASIC]] initially used a [[Microsoft Binary Format|32-bit format]], while later versions expanded this to 40-bits. Most BASICs had problems with rounding that led to simple equations resulting in tiny non-zero remainders.\n\nIt is generally agreed that FOCAL was more efficient in its use of resources than comparable BASIC systems. On a typical machine of the day, often with 6 to 24 kilobytes of [[magnetic-core memory]], FOCAL could handle larger and more complex programming tasks than BASIC.\n\n== Versions and spinoffs ==\nThe Coca-Cola Corporation used a customized version of FOCAL called COKE.\n\nFOCAL was later implemented on the PDP-7, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, PDP-5 and LINC-8.\n\nThe FOCAL manual showed how to add commands to the FOCAL parser, so many sites added specialized commands for operating custom hardware.\n\nThe [[DECUS|Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society]] collected many patches and enhancements for FOCAL. There were even major enhanced offshoots of FOCAL, such as FOCAL-W, which added many features, including better mass storage file I/O and even virtual variable memory.\n\nIn [[Russia]], it saw use as late as the early 1990s in mass-produced home computers of the [[Electronika BK]] series.\n\n==Example code==\nThe original Lunar Lander makes an excellent example for examining FOCAL code, as it uses most of the features of the language. This code is from the original, found on [https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html Jim Storer's Lunar Lander page].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lunar Lander |url=https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander/LunarLanderListing.jpg |website= Lunar Landing Game Related Documents}}</ref>\n \n 01.04 T \"CONTROL CALLING LUNAR MODULE.

This was almost universal in FOCAL programs (and JOSS), as the line number scheme made such constructs easy to use. This program uses nine routines. The first, group 1, simply prints out the instructions using the {{code|T}}ype statement and sets the initial values for the run. The mass of fuel is not recorded directly, instead, it uses the current {{code|M}}ass and empty mass, {{code|N}}, so the remaining fuel is M-N and the lander runs out of fuel when M-N is 0. Also note the {{code|E}}rase at the end of line 1.20, which resets all the variable values.\n\nThe main game loop is driven by group 2. As the code \"falls\" through group 1 into group 2 during the first run, the initial values are printed out in the first two lines. Near the end of line 2.20, the user is {{code|A}}sked to input the burn rate as {{code|K}}, and then the loop timer is reset using {{code|S T{{=}}10}}. Line 2.70 tests the user's input against several possibilities, if it is over 200 or below 8 it types \"NOT POSSIBLE\" and a row of periods, and then loops back to ask the user to try again. If the value is between these values, it jumps forward to group 3. Note that the limited capabilities of FOCAL's {{code|IF}} command are evident here, in BASIC this could be reduced to a single {{code|IF K>200 OR K<8 THEN...}}\n\nGroup 3 first tests to see if the fuel has run out, and jumps to group 4 if it has. Then it tests if the 10-second period in {{code|T}} has expired and, if so, loops back to print everything out again, which has the side-effect of resetting T and S to 10. Line 3.40 tests to see if the amount of fuel burned this period, S*K, will reduce the mass of the vehicle as a whole, S*K-M, beyond the empty weight, N. If not, it moves on, if it will, it instead sets the loop timer to the amount of time the remaining fuel will burn, thus ending the loop early. In either case, it calls group 9 to update the velocity and position. It then loops over groups 7, 8 and 9 until the value of I converges.\n\nWhen the 10-second timer runs out, or it reaches the end due to the fuel test in line 3.10 or the altitude test in 7.10. In the latter cases, it will jump to group 4 and fall through to group 5, or jump to group 5 directly. Group 5 types the end-of-game results and then asks the user if they'd like to try again. If so, it jumps to 1.20 to clear out all values and print the headers again, if not if falls through to 5.98 and {{code|Q}}uits.\n\n==See also==\n*[[JOSS]], the Rand language that inspired FOCAL\n*[[MUMPS]], a data-manipulation language based on JOSS and FOCAL concepts\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n |title=FOCAL Programming Manual \n |publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation \n |date=1968 \n |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/www.computer.museum.uq.edu.au/pdf/DEC-08-AJAB-D%20PDP-8-I%20FOCAL%20Programming%20Manual.pdf \n|ref=CITEREFManual1968\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/216469/A_basic_history_of_BASIC_on_its_50th_birthday.php\n |title=A basic history of BASIC on its 50th birthday\n |website=Gamasutra\n |date=1 May 2014\n |first=John |last=Szczepaniak\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite interview\n |first=Kevin |last=Savetz\n |date=April 2013\n |title=Dave Ahl and Betsy Ahl\n |url=https://computingpioneers.com/index.php?title=Dave_Ahl_and_Betsy_Ahl\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[ftp://ftp.pdp8.net/software/games/focal/ FOCAL source code], FOCAL source for several programs, including Lunar Lander, Sumer Game, and others\n*[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/focal/ DEC's FOCAL 1969 Promotional Booklet]\n*[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/ The Computer History Simulation Project (Focal is available as a free download here)]\n*ftp://www.cozx.com/pub/langs/focal.tar.gz C-source version that runs under several operating systems, including Linux\n*[http://www.catb.org/retro the C-source for a modern DOS version suitable for teaching]  \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525101809/http://www.libex.ru/detail/book91959.html Abramov V.A.

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The entire building collapsed except the core which housed the elevator shaft and stairwell. The core collapsed slightly at its base then just stopped falling.

{"title_page": "Japanese folktales", "text_new": "{{About||folklore more generally|Japanese folklore|mythical folk-ballad of the Ainu|yukar}}\n{{Lead rewrite|date=December 2014}}\n\n'''Japanese folktales ''' are an important cultural aspect of Japan. In commonplace usage, they signify a certain set of well-known classic tales, with a vague distinction of whether they fit the rigorous definition of \"[[Oral tradition|folktale]]\" or not among various types of [[folklore]]. The admixed imposters are literate written pieces, dating back to the [[Muromachi period]] (14th-16th centuries) or even earlier times in the Middle Ages. These would not normally qualify as \"folktales\" (i.e., pieces collected from oral tradition among the populace).\n\nIn a more stringent sense, \"Japanese folktales\" refer to orally transmitted folk narrative. Systematic collection of specimens was pioneered by folklorist [[Kunio Yanagita]]. Yanagita disliked the word '''{{Nihongo|''minwa''|\u6c11\u8a71}}''', a coined term directly translated from \"folktale\" (Yanagita stated that the term was not familiar to actual old folk he collected folktales from, and was not willing to \"go along\" with the conventions of other countries<ref>Yanagita, \"Preface to the 1960 edition\", appended to ''Nihon no mukashibanashi'' (Folk tales of Japan), Shinchosha, 1983, p.175.</ref>). He therefore proposed the use of the term {{Nihongo|mukashibanashi|[[:ja:\u6614\u8a71]]|\"tales of long ago\"}} to apply to all creative types of folktales (i.e., those that are not \"legendary\" types which are more of a reportage).<ref name=heibonsha-minwa>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1969}}, encyclopedia, vol.21, 492</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nA representative sampling of Japanese folklore would definitely include the quintessential '''''[[Momotar\u014d]]''''' ('''Peach Boy'''), and perhaps other folktales listed among the so-called {{nihongo|\"five great fairy tales\"|\u4e94\u5927\u6614\u8a71|Go-dai Mukashi banashi}}:<ref name=asakura>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Asakura|first=Haruhiko(\u671d\u5009\u6cbb\u5f66)|title=\u795e\u8a71\u4f1d\u8aac\u4e8b\u5178|publisher=\u6771\u4eac\u5802\u51fa\u7248|year=1963|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8xAQAAIAAJ7|isbn=978-4-490-10033-4}}, p.198. quote:\"\u3054\u3060\u3044\u304a\u3068\u304e\u3071\u306a\u3057\uff08\u4e94\u5927\u5fa1\u4f3d\u8a71\uff09\u3002\u4e94\u5927\u6614\u8a71\u3068\u3082\u3044\u3046\u3002\u6843\u592a\u90ce\u3001\u733f\u87f9\u5408\u6226\u3001\u820c\u5207\u96c0\u3001\u82b1\u54b2\u723a\u3001\u304b\u3061\u304b\u3061\u5c71\u306e\u4e94\u8a71\"</ref> the battle between ''[[The Crab and the Monkey]]'', ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'' (Tongue-cut sparrow), ''[[Hanasaka Jiisan]]'' (Flower-blooming old man), and ''[[Kachi-kachi Yama]]''.\n\nThese stories just named are considered genuine folktales, having received those auspices by folklorist Kunio Yanagita.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Yanagita|first=Kunio(\u67f3\u7530\u570b\u7537)|title=Collected Works (\u67f3\u7530\u570b\u7537\u5168\u96c6)|volume=6|publisher=Tsukuma Shobo|year=1998|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1Q0AQAAIAAJ}}, p.253, says calling them ''otogibanashi'' (see below) is a misnomer, since they are ''mukashi banashi'' (Yanagita's preferred term for folktales orally transmitted)</ref> During the [[Edo period]] these tales had been adapted by professional writers and woodblock-printed in a form a called ''[[kusaz\u014dshi]]'' (cf.[[chapbooks]]), but a number of local variant versions of the tales have been collected in the field as well.\n\nAs a forestated, non-genuine folktales are those already committed to writing long ago, the earliest being the tale of Princess Kaguya (or ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]''), an example of [[monogatari]] type of romance dated to as early as the 10th century,<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dickins|first= F.

The text gives reference, for example, to the flame-proof \"{{nihongo|''fire rat''|[[:ja:\u706b\u9f20|\u706b\u9f20]]|Hinezumi}} (or [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]])'s fur robe\" (perhaps familiar to watchers of the anime ''[[Inuyasha]]'' as the vestment of the title character), which attests to considerable degree of book-knowledge and learning by its author.\n\nOther examples of pseudo-folktales which have been composed in the Middle Ages are the ''[[Uji Sh\u016bi Monogatari]]'' (13th century) that includes the nucleus of classics as ([[Kobutori Jisan|''Kobutori J\u012bsan'']] - the old man with the hump on his cheek, and ''[[Straw Millionaire]]''). This and the ''[[Konjaku Monogatarish\u016b]]'' (12th century) also contains a number of type of tales designated ''[[setsuwa]]'', a generic term for narratives of various nature, anything from moralizing to comical.

The tanuki begs the wife not to cook him and promises to help with the cooking if he is spared. The wife agrees and unties him. The tanuki then transforms into her and kills her, then cooks her in a stew. Disguised as the man's wife, the tanuki feeds him his wife. Once he is done, the tanuki transforms back to his original form and teases the man for eating his wife. A rabbit that was friends with the family was furious, so he had the tanuki carry sticks and, while he wasn't looking, set these sticks on fire. Then the rabbit treated the burn with hot pepper paste. Finally, the rabbit convinced the tanuki to build a boat of clay, and the rabbit followed in a sturdy boat. The clay boat began to sink, so the tanuki tried to escape, but then the rabbit hit him in the head with an oar, knocking him out and making him drown.<ref name=piggott/>\n\n'''Badger and Fox cub''': A badger, vixen, and the vixen's cub lived in a forest that was running out of food, so they came up with the plan of one of them pretending to be dead, the other disguising as a merchant, and the \u201cmerchant\u201d selling the \u201cdead\u201d animal to a human. Then they would have money to buy food. The vixen pretended to be dead while the badger was the merchant. While the transaction was happening however, the badger told the human that the vixen wasn't actually dead, so the human killed her. This infuriated the cub, so he proposed a competition. They would both disguise as humans and go into the village at different times. Whoever guessed what \u201chuman\u201d was the other first, wins. The cub walked towards the village first, but he hid behind a tree. The badger went into the village, and accused the governor of being the fox, so the bodyguards of the governor beheaded him.<ref name=piggott/>\n\n==Theorized influences==\n{{Fringe theories|section|date=May 2012}}\nThe folklore of Japan has been influenced by foreign literature as well as the kind of [[spirit worship]] prevalent all throughout prehistoric Asia.\n\nThe monkey stories of Japanese folklore have been influenced both by the [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] [[Ramayana]] and the [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] classic ''[[Journey to the West]]''.<ref>On the Road to Baghdad Or Traveling Biculturalism: Theorizing a Bicultural Approach to...

In commonplace usage, they signify a certain set of well-known classic tales, with a vague distinction of whether they fit the rigorous definition of \"[[Oral tradition|folktale]]\" or not among various types of [[folklore]]. The admixed imposters are literate written pieces, dating back to the [[Muromachi period]] (14th-16th centuries) or even earlier times in the Middle Ages. These would not normally qualify as \"folktales\" (i.e., pieces collected from oral tradition among the populace).\n\nIn a more stringent sense, \"Japanese folktales\" refer to orally transmitted folk narrative. Systematic collection of specimens was pioneered by folklorist [[Kunio Yanagita]]. Yanagita disliked the word '''{{Nihongo|''minwa''|\u6c11\u8a71}}''', a coined term directly translated from \"folktale\" (Yanagita stated that the term was not familiar to actual old folk he collected folktales from, and was not willing to \"go along\" with the conventions of other countries<ref>Yanagita, \"Preface to the 1960 edition\", appended to ''Nihon no mukashibanashi'' (Folk tales of Japan), Shinchosha, 1983, p.175.</ref>). He therefore proposed the use of the term {{Nihongo|mukashibanashi|[[:ja:\u6614\u8a71]]|\"tales of long ago\"}} to apply to all creative types of folktales (i.e., those that are not \"legendary\" types which are more of a reportage).<ref name=heibonsha-minwa>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1969}}, encyclopedia, vol.21, 492</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nA representative sampling of Japanese folklore would definitely include the quintessential '''''[[Momotar\u014d]]''''' ('''Peach Boy'''), and perhaps other folktales listed among the so-called {{nihongo|\"five great fairy tales\"|\u4e94\u5927\u6614\u8a71|Go-dai Mukashi banashi}}:<ref name=asakura>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Asakura|first=Haruhiko(\u671d\u5009\u6cbb\u5f66)|title=\u795e\u8a71\u4f1d\u8aac\u4e8b\u5178|publisher=\u6771\u4eac\u5802\u51fa\u7248|year=1963|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo8xAQAAIAAJ7|isbn=978-4-490-10033-4}}, p.198. quote:\"\u3054\u3060\u3044\u304a\u3068\u304e\u3071\u306a\u3057\uff08\u4e94\u5927\u5fa1\u4f3d\u8a71\uff09\u3002\u4e94\u5927\u6614\u8a71\u3068\u3082\u3044\u3046\u3002\u6843\u592a\u90ce\u3001\u733f\u87f9\u5408\u6226\u3001\u820c\u5207\u96c0\u3001\u82b1\u54b2\u723a\u3001\u304b\u3061\u304b\u3061\u5c71\u306e\u4e94\u8a71\"</ref> the battle between ''[[The Crab and the Monkey]]'', ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'' (Tongue-cut sparrow), ''[[Hanasaka Jiisan]]'' (Flower-blooming old man), and ''[[Kachi-kachi Yama]]''.\n\nThese stories just named are considered genuine folktales, having received those auspices by folklorist Kunio Yanagita.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Yanagita|first=Kunio(\u67f3\u7530\u570b\u7537)|title=Collected Works (\u67f3\u7530\u570b\u7537\u5168\u96c6)|volume=6|publisher=Tsukuma Shobo|year=1998|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1Q0AQAAIAAJ}}, p.253, says calling them ''otogibanashi'' (see below) is a misnomer, since they are ''mukashi banashi'' (Yanagita's preferred term for folktales orally transmitted)</ref> During the [[Edo period]] these tales had been adapted by professional writers and woodblock-printed in a form a called ''[[kusaz\u014dshi]]'' (cf.[[chapbooks]]), but a number of local variant versions of the tales have been collected in the field as well.\n\nAs a forestated, non-genuine folktales are those already committed to writing long ago, the earliest being the tale of Princess Kaguya (or ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]''), an example of [[monogatari]] type of romance dated to as early as the 10th century,<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dickins|first= F.

The washer woman picked the largest box and instead of gaining riches, she was devoured by devils.<ref name=piggott>Japanese Mythology: Library of the World's Myths and Legends, by Juliet Piggott</ref>\n\n'''Mandarin Ducks''': A man kills a drake mandarin duck for food. That night he had a dream that a woman was accusing him of murdering her husband, and then told him to return to the lake. The man does this, and a female mandarin walks up to him and tears its chest open.<ref name=piggott/>\n\n'''Tanuki and Rabbit''': A man catches a tanuki and tells his wife to cook it in a stew. The tanuki begs the wife not to cook him and promises to help with the cooking if he is spared. The wife agrees and unties him. The tanuki then transforms into her and kills her, then cooks her in a stew. Disguised as the man's wife, the tanuki feeds him his wife. Once he is done, the tanuki transforms back to his original form and teases the man for eating his wife. A rabbit that was friends with the family was furious, so he had the tanuki carry sticks and, while he wasn't looking, set these sticks on fire. Then the rabbit treated the burn with hot pepper paste. Finally, the rabbit convinced the tanuki to build a boat of clay, and the rabbit followed in a sturdy boat. The clay boat began to sink, so the tanuki tried to escape, but then the rabbit hit him in the head with an oar, knocking him out and making him drown.<ref name=piggott/>\n\n'''Badger and Fox cub''': A badger, vixen, and the vixen's cub lived in a forest that was running out of food, so they came up with the plan of one of them pretending to be dead, the other disguising as a merchant, and the \u201cmerchant\u201d selling the \u201cdead\u201d animal to a human. Then they would have money to buy food. The vixen pretended to be dead while the badger was the merchant. While the transaction was happening however, the badger told the human that the vixen wasn't actually dead, so the human killed her. This infuriated the cub, so he proposed a competition. They would both disguise as humans and go into the village at different times. Whoever guessed what \u201chuman\u201d was the other first, wins. The cub walked towards the village first, but he hid behind a tree. The badger went into the village, and accused the governor of being the fox, so the bodyguards of the governor beheaded him.<ref name=piggott/>\n\n==Theorized influences==\n{{Fringe theories|section|date=May 2012}}\nThe folklore of Japan has been influenced by foreign literature as well as the kind of [[spirit worship]] prevalent all throughout prehistoric Asia.\n\nThe monkey stories of Japanese folklore have been influenced both by the [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] [[Ramayana]] and the [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] classic ''[[Journey to the West]]''.<ref>On the Road to Baghdad Or Traveling Biculturalism: Theorizing a Bicultural Approach to...
