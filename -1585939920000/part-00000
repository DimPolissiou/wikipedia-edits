Common support units include a [[hospital pharmacy|pharmacy]], [[pathology]], and [[radiology]].\n\nHospitals are usually [[publicly funded healthcare|funded by the public sector]], health organisations ([[For-profit hospital|for profit]] or [[Non-profit organisation|nonprofit]]), [[health insurance]] companies, or [[Charitable organisation|charities]], including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by [[religious orders]], or by charitable individuals and leaders..<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Daniel|title=Altar and Table: A phenomenology of the surgeon-priest|journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|date=December 2008|volume=81|issue=4|quote=Although physicians were available in varying capacities in ancient Rome and Athens, the institution of a hospital dedicated to the care of the sick was a distinctly Christian innovation rooted in the monastic virtue and practise of hospitality. Arranged around the monastery were concentric rings of buildings in which the life and work of the monastic community was ordered. The outer ring of buildings served as a hostel in which travellers were received and boarded. The inner ring served as a place where the monastic community could care for the sick, the poor and the infirm. Monks were frequently familiar with the medicine available at that time, growing medicinal plants on the monastery grounds and applying remedies as indicated. As such, many of the practicing physicians of the Middle Ages were also clergy.|pmc=2605310|pmid=19099050|pages=193\u201398}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional [[physician]]s, [[surgeon]]s, [[nurse]]s, and [[Allied health professions|allied health practitioners]], whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by [[volunteering|volunteers]]. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the [[Alexians]] and the [[Bon Secours Sisters]] that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lovoll|first=Odd|title=A Portrait of Norwegian Americans Today|year=1998|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2832-2|page=192}}</ref> In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally \"places of hospitality\", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Hospital.svg|alt=White H on blue background, used to represent hospitals in the US.|thumb|During peacetime, hospitals can be indicated by a variety of symbols. For example, a  white 'H' on a blue background is often used in the United States. During times of armed conflict, a hospital may be marked with the emblem of the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|red cross, red crescent or red crystal]] in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]].]] During the Middle Ages, hospitals served different functions from modern institutions. Middle Ages hospitals were [[almshouses]] for the poor, [[hostel]]s for [[pilgrims]], or [[hospital school]]s. The word \"hospital\" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''hospes'', signifying a stranger or foreigner, hence a guest. Another noun derived from this, ''hospitium'' came to signify hospitality, that is the relation between guest and shelterer, hospitality, friendliness, and hospitable reception. By [[metonymy]] the Latin word then came to mean a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an [[inn]].<ref>''Cassell's Latin Dictionary'', revised by J. Marchant & J. Charles, 260th. thousand.</ref> ''Hospes'' is thus the root for the English words ''host'' (where the ''p'' was dropped for convenience of pronunciation) ''[[hospitality]]'', ''[[hospice]]'', ''[[hostel]]'' and ''[[hotel]]''. The latter modern word derives from Latin via the ancient French romance word ''hostel'', which developed a silent ''s'', which letter was eventually removed from the word, the loss of which is signified by a [[circumflex]] in the modern French word ''h\u00f4tel''. The German word 'Spital' shares similar roots.\n\nThe [[grammar]] of the word [[American and British English differences|differs]] slightly depending on the dialect. In the United States, ''hospital'' usually requires an article; in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the word normally is used without an article when it is the object of a preposition and when referring to a patient (\"in/to the hospital\" vs. \"in/to hospital\"); in Canada, both uses are found.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n=={{anchor|Types}} Types==\n\nSome [[patient]]s go to a hospital just for [[diagnosis]], treatment, or therapy and then leave (\"outpatients\") without staying overnight; while others are \"admitted\" and stay overnight or for several days or weeks or months (\"inpatients\"). Hospitals usually are distinguished from other types of medical facilities by their ability to admit and care for inpatients whilst the others, which are smaller, are often described as clinics.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" >\nFile:Intensivstation (01) 2007-03-03.jpg|A standard [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) within a hospital\nFile:KlinikumAachen.jpg|The [[Uniklinikum Aachen]] in [[Germany]] is the largest hospital in the world, count in a single building, with over 1200 beds.\nFile:AIIMS central lawn.jpg|[[AIIMS, New Delhi|All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] in [[Delhi]], India\nFile:Lehigh-Valley-Hospital.x.jpg|[[Lehigh Valley Hospital]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n</gallery>\n===General and acute care===\nThe best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, also known as an acute-care hospital. These facilities handle many kinds of disease and injury, and normally have an emergency department (sometimes known as \"accident & emergency\") or [[trauma center]] to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health. Larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities. Some hospitals, especially in the United States and Canada, have their own ambulance service.\n\n===District===\nA district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for [[intensive care]], [[Critical care medicine|critical care]], and long-term care.\n\nIn [[California]], \"district hospital\" refers specifically to a class of healthcare facility created shortly after [[World War II]] to address a shortage of hospital beds in many local communities.<ref name=DHLF2013>{{cite web|title=Our Background|url=http://www.cadhlf.org/about-dhlf/our-background/|publisher=District Hospital Leadership Forum|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=Knox2013>{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=Dennis|title=District Hospitals' Important Mission|url=http://payersandproviders.com/opinion-detail.php?id=97|publisher=Payers &\u2013\u00b0 Providers|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> Even today, district hospitals are the sole public hospitals in 19 of California's counties,<ref name=DHLF2013 /> and are the sole locally-accessible hospital within nine additional counties in which one or more other hospitals are present at substantial distance from a local community.<ref name=DHLF2013 /> Twenty-eight of California's rural hospitals and 20 of its critical-access hospitals are district hospitals.<ref name=Knox2013 /> They are formed by local municipalities, have boards that are individually elected by their local communities, and exist to serve local needs.<ref name=DHLF2013 /><ref name=Knox2013 /> They are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with [[Medi-Cal]] (which is California's [[Medicaid]] program, serving low-income persons, some [[senior citizens]], persons with [[disabilities]], children in [[foster care]], and pregnant women).<ref name=DHLF2013 /><ref name=Knox2013 /> In 2012, district hospitals provided $54 million in uncompensated care in California.<ref name=Knox2013 />\n\n===Specialized===\n[[File:Starship Children's Health Auckland.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Starship Children's Health]] is a children's hospital in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].]]\n\nTypes of specialized hospitals include [[rehabilitation hospital]]s, [[children's hospital]]s, seniors' ([[geriatric]]) hospitals, [[Long-term acute care facility|long-term acute care facilities]] and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] problems (see [[psychiatric hospital]]), certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopedic problems, and so forth. In Germany specialised hospitals are called ''Fachkrankenhaus''; an example is [[Fachkrankenhaus Coswig]] (thoracic surgery).\n\nA hospital may be a single building or a [[building#Complex|number of buildings]] on a [[campus]]. Many hospitals with pre-twentieth-century origins began as one building and evolved into campuses. Some hospitals are affiliated with [[universities]] for [[medical research]] and the training of medical personnel such as physicians and nurses, often called teaching hospitals. Worldwide, most hospitals are run on a [[nonprofit]] basis by governments or charities. There are however a few exceptions, e.g. China, where government funding only constitutes 10% of income of hospitals. ''(need citation here. Chinese sources seem conflicted about the for-profit/non-profit ratio of hospitals in China)''\n\nSpecialised hospitals can help reduce [[health care costs]] compared to general hospitals. For example, [[Narayana Health]]'s Bangalore cardiac unit, which is specialised in cardiac surgery, allows for significantly greater number of patients. It has 3000 beds (more than 20 times the average American hospital) and in pediatric heart surgery alone, it performs 3000 heart operations annually, making it by far the largest such facility in the world.<ref name=fastcompany>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/node/153 |title=Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospitals |publisher=fastcompany.com |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003195219/http://www.fastcompany.com/node/153 |archivedate=3 October 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"bbc1\"/> Surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation; thus, the costs to the hospital drops when the number of procedures increases, taking advantage of [[economies of scale]].<ref name=fastcompany/> Additionally, it is argued that costs go down as all its specialists become efficient by working on one \"production line\" procedure.<ref name=bbc1/>\n\n===Teaching===\n[[File:McMasterUMedical.jpg|thumb|right|[[McMaster University Medical Centre]] is a teaching hospital in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]]]\nA [[teaching hospital]] combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses and often is linked to a medical school, nursing school or university.\nIn some countries like UK exists the clinical attachment system that is defined as a period of time when a doctor is attached to a named supervisor in a clinical unit, with the broad aims of observing clinical practice in the UK and the role of doctors and other healthcare professionals in the National Health Service (NHS).\n\n===Clinics===\n{{main|Clinic}}\nThe medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a [[clinic]], and often is run by a [[government agency]] for health services or a private [[partnership]] of physicians (in nations where private practice is allowed).

Hospitals may have acute services such as an [[emergency department]] or specialist [[trauma center]], [[Burn (injury)|burn unit]], [[surgery]], or [[urgent care]]. These may then be backed up by more specialist units such as the following:\n* [[Emergency department]]\n* [[Cardiology]]\n* [[Intensive care unit]]\n** [[Paediatric intensive care unit]]\n** [[Neonatal intensive care unit]]\n** Cardiovascular intensive care unit\n* [[Neurology]]\n* [[Oncology]]\n* [[Obstetrics and gynaecology]], colloquially, [[maternity ward]]\n\nIn addition, there is the [[Nursing management|department of nursing]], often headed by a [[chief nursing officer]] or [[Nursing management#Director of nursing|director of nursing]]. This department is responsible for the administration of professional nursing practice, [[Nursing research|research]], and policy for the hospital. Nursing permeates every part of a hospital. Many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty.

The [[National Health Service]], the principal provider of health care in the United Kingdom, was founded in 1948. During the nineteenth century, the Second Viennese Medical School emerged with the contributions of physicians such as [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]], [[Josef \u0160koda]], [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra]], and [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]].

Independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and [[hospital accreditation]] is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as [[international healthcare accreditation]], by groups such as [[Accreditation Canada]] from [[Canada]], the [[Joint Commission]] from the US, the [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]] from Great Britain, and Haute Authorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (HAS) from France.\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] noted in 2011 that going into hospital was far riskier than flying.  Globally the chance of a patient being subject to an error was about 10%  and the chance of death resulting from an error was about 1 in 300 according to [[Liam Donaldson]]. 7% of hospitalised patients in developed countries, and 10% in developing countries, acquire at least one health care-associated infection. In the USA 1.7 million infections are acquired in hospital each year, leading to 100,000 deaths, figures much worse than in Europe where there were 4.5 million infections and 37,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Going into hospital far riskier than flying: WHO |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safety/going-into-hospital-far-riskier-than-flying-who-idUSTRE76K45R20110721 |accessdate=27 January 2019 |publisher=Reuters |date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:UVa Medical Center.jpg|thumb|The medical center at the [[University of Virginia]] shows the growing trend for modern architecture in hospitals.]]\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:NHS NNUH entrance.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|The [[National Health Service]] [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]] in the UK, showing the utilitarian architecture of many modern hospitals]]\n[[File:Fawcett Memorial Hospital Chapel.jpg|right|upright=0.8|thumb|Hospital chapel at [[Fawcett Memorial Hospital]] ([[Port Charlotte, Florida]])]]\n\nModern hospital buildings are designed to minimise the effort of medical personnel and the possibility of contamination while maximising the efficiency of the whole system. Travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised. The building also should be built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring, plumbing, and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.<ref>[[Annmarie Adams]], ''Medicine by Design: The Architect and the Modern Hospital, 1893\u20131943'' (2009)</ref>\n\nHowever, many hospitals, even those considered \"modern\", are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or even centuries, with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and finances dictate. As a result, Dutch architectural historian [[Cor Wagenaar]] has called many hospitals:\n\n:''\"...&nbsp;built catastrophes, anonymous institutional complexes run by vast bureaucracies, and totally unfit for the purpose they have been designed for&nbsp;... They are hardly ever functional, and instead of making patients feel at home, they produce stress and anxiety.\"<ref name=\"ODE\">''[http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/35/healing_by_design Healing by design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017220150/http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/35/healing_by_design |date=17 October 2007 }}'' \u2013 ''Ode Magazine'', July/August 2006 issue. Accessed 10 February 2008.</ref>\n\nSome newer hospitals now try to re-establish design that takes the patient's psychological needs into account, such as providing more fresh air, better views and more pleasant colour schemes. These ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century, when the concept of providing fresh air and access to the 'healing powers of nature' were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings.<ref name=\"ODE\"/>\n\nThe research of [[British Medical Association]] is showing that good hospital design can reduce patient's recovery time. Exposure to daylight is effective in reducing depression. Single-sex accommodation help ensure that patients are treated in privacy and with dignity. Exposure to nature and hospital gardens is also important \u2013 looking out windows improves patients' moods and reduces blood pressure and stress level. Open windows in patient rooms have also demonstrated some evidence of beneficial outcomes by improving airflow and increased microbial diversity.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/20/open-hospital-windows-stem-infections|title=Open hospital windows to stem spread of infections, says microbiologist|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2012-02-20|journal=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22269698|title=Closed windows 'increase infection'|last=Bowdler|first=Neil|date=2013-04-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> Eliminating long corridors can reduce nurses' fatigue and stress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The psychological and social needs of patients |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/health_promotion_ethics/psychologicalandsocialneedsofpatients.jsp?page=8 |publisher=[[British Medical Association]] |accessdate=14 March 2011 |date=7 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314184736/http://www.bma.org.uk/health_promotion_ethics/psychologicalandsocialneedsofpatients.jsp?page=8 |archivedate=14 March 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAnother ongoing major development is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by movable partitions) to one in which they are accommodated in individual rooms. The ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy. A major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.<ref>''[http://www.nationalreviewofmedicine.com/issue/2004/11_15/feature05_21.html Health administrators go shopping for new hospital designs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226075348/http://www.nationalreviewofmedicine.com/issue/2004/11_15/feature05_21.html |date=26 December 2008 }}'' \u2013 ''[[National Review of Medicine]]'', Monday 15 November 2004, Volume 1 No. 21</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of medicine]]\n* [[Lists of hospitals]]\n* [[Burn center]]\n* [[Hospital information system]]\n* [[Trauma center]]\n* [[The Waiting Room (2012 film)|The Waiting Room]]\n* [[Walk-in clinic]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[https://www.who.int/hospitals/en/ WHO Hospitals Database]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===History of hospitals===\n* Brockliss, Lawrence, and Colin Jones. \"The Hospital in the Enlightenment,\" in ''The Medical World of Early Modern France'' (Oxford UP, 1997), pp.&nbsp;671\u2013729; covers France 1650\u20131800\n* Chaney, Edward (2000),\"'Philanthropy in Italy': English Observations on Italian Hospitals 1545\u20131789\", in: ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance'', 2nd ed.

Arranged around the monastery were concentric rings of buildings in which the life and work of the monastic community was ordered. The outer ring of buildings served as a hostel in which travellers were received and boarded. The inner ring served as a place where the monastic community could care for the sick, the poor and the infirm. Monks were frequently familiar with the medicine available at that time, growing medicinal plants on the monastery grounds and applying remedies as indicated. As such, many of the practicing physicians of the Middle Ages were also clergy.|pmc=2605310|pmid=19099050|pages=193\u201398}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional [[physician]]s, [[surgeon]]s, [[nurse]]s, and [[Allied health professions|allied health practitioners]], whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by [[volunteering|volunteers]]. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the [[Alexians]] and the [[Bon Secours Sisters]] that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lovoll|first=Odd|title=A Portrait of Norwegian Americans Today|year=1998|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2832-2|page=192}}</ref> In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally \"places of hospitality\", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Hospital.svg|alt=White H on blue background, used to represent hospitals in the US.|thumb|During peacetime, hospitals can be indicated by a variety of symbols. For example, a  white 'H' on a blue background is often used in the United States. During times of armed conflict, a hospital may be marked with the emblem of the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|red cross, red crescent or red crystal]] in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]].]]First five hospitals in world was biuld in Bagdad. During the Middle Ages, hospitals served different functions from modern institutions. Middle Ages hospitals were [[almshouses]] for the poor, [[hostel]]s for [[pilgrims]], or [[hospital school]]s. The word \"hospital\" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''hospes'', signifying a stranger or foreigner, hence a guest. Another noun derived from this, ''hospitium'' came to signify hospitality, that is the relation between guest and shelterer, hospitality, friendliness, and hospitable reception. By [[metonymy]] the Latin word then came to mean a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an [[inn]].<ref>''Cassell's Latin Dictionary'', revised by J. Marchant & J. Charles, 260th. thousand.</ref> ''Hospes'' is thus the root for the English words ''host'' (where the ''p'' was dropped for convenience of pronunciation) ''[[hospitality]]'', ''[[hospice]]'', ''[[hostel]]'' and ''[[hotel]]''. The latter modern word derives from Latin via the ancient French romance word ''hostel'', which developed a silent ''s'', which letter was eventually removed from the word, the loss of which is signified by a [[circumflex]] in the modern French word ''h\u00f4tel''. The German word 'Spital' shares similar roots.\n\nThe [[grammar]] of the word [[American and British English differences|differs]] slightly depending on the dialect. In the United States, ''hospital'' usually requires an article; in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the word normally is used without an article when it is the object of a preposition and when referring to a patient (\"in/to the hospital\" vs. \"in/to hospital\"); in Canada, both uses are found.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n=={{anchor|Types}} Types==\n\nSome [[patient]]s go to a hospital just for [[diagnosis]], treatment, or therapy and then leave (\"outpatients\") without staying overnight; while others are \"admitted\" and stay overnight or for several days or weeks or months (\"inpatients\"). Hospitals usually are distinguished from other types of medical facilities by their ability to admit and care for inpatients whilst the others, which are smaller, are often described as clinics.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" >\nFile:Intensivstation (01) 2007-03-03.jpg|A standard [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) within a hospital\nFile:KlinikumAachen.jpg|The [[Uniklinikum Aachen]] in [[Germany]] is the largest hospital in the world, count in a single building, with over 1200 beds.\nFile:AIIMS central lawn.jpg|[[AIIMS, New Delhi|All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] in [[Delhi]], India\nFile:Lehigh-Valley-Hospital.x.jpg|[[Lehigh Valley Hospital]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n</gallery>\n===General and acute care===\nThe best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, also known as an acute-care hospital. These facilities handle many kinds of disease and injury, and normally have an emergency department (sometimes known as \"accident & emergency\") or [[trauma center]] to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health. Larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities. Some hospitals, especially in the United States and Canada, have their own ambulance service.\n\n===District===\nA district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for [[intensive care]], [[Critical care medicine|critical care]], and long-term care.\n\nIn [[California]], \"district hospital\" refers specifically to a class of healthcare facility created shortly after [[World War II]] to address a shortage of hospital beds in many local communities.<ref name=DHLF2013>{{cite web|title=Our Background|url=http://www.cadhlf.org/about-dhlf/our-background/|publisher=District Hospital Leadership Forum|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=Knox2013>{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=Dennis|title=District Hospitals' Important Mission|url=http://payersandproviders.com/opinion-detail.php?id=97|publisher=Payers &\u2013\u00b0 Providers|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> Even today, district hospitals are the sole public hospitals in 19 of California's counties,<ref name=DHLF2013 /> and are the sole locally-accessible hospital within nine additional counties in which one or more other hospitals are present at substantial distance from a local community.<ref name=DHLF2013 /> Twenty-eight of California's rural hospitals and 20 of its critical-access hospitals are district hospitals.<ref name=Knox2013 /> They are formed by local municipalities, have boards that are individually elected by their local communities, and exist to serve local needs.<ref name=DHLF2013 /><ref name=Knox2013 /> They are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with [[Medi-Cal]] (which is California's [[Medicaid]] program, serving low-income persons, some [[senior citizens]], persons with [[disabilities]], children in [[foster care]], and pregnant women).<ref name=DHLF2013 /><ref name=Knox2013 /> In 2012, district hospitals provided $54 million in uncompensated care in California.<ref name=Knox2013 />\n\n===Specialized===\n[[File:Starship Children's Health Auckland.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Starship Children's Health]] is a children's hospital in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].]]\n\nTypes of specialized hospitals include [[rehabilitation hospital]]s, [[children's hospital]]s, seniors' ([[geriatric]]) hospitals, [[Long-term acute care facility|long-term acute care facilities]] and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] problems (see [[psychiatric hospital]]), certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopedic problems, and so forth. In Germany specialised hospitals are called ''Fachkrankenhaus''; an example is [[Fachkrankenhaus Coswig]] (thoracic surgery).\n\nA hospital may be a single building or a [[building#Complex|number of buildings]] on a [[campus]]. Many hospitals with pre-twentieth-century origins began as one building and evolved into campuses. Some hospitals are affiliated with [[universities]] for [[medical research]] and the training of medical personnel such as physicians and nurses, often called teaching hospitals. Worldwide, most hospitals are run on a [[nonprofit]] basis by governments or charities. There are however a few exceptions, e.g. China, where government funding only constitutes 10% of income of hospitals. ''(need citation here. Chinese sources seem conflicted about the for-profit/non-profit ratio of hospitals in China)''\n\nSpecialised hospitals can help reduce [[health care costs]] compared to general hospitals. For example, [[Narayana Health]]'s Bangalore cardiac unit, which is specialised in cardiac surgery, allows for significantly greater number of patients. It has 3000 beds (more than 20 times the average American hospital) and in pediatric heart surgery alone, it performs 3000 heart operations annually, making it by far the largest such facility in the world.<ref name=fastcompany>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/node/153 |title=Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospitals |publisher=fastcompany.com |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003195219/http://www.fastcompany.com/node/153 |archivedate=3 October 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"bbc1\"/> Surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation; thus, the costs to the hospital drops when the number of procedures increases, taking advantage of [[economies of scale]].<ref name=fastcompany/> Additionally, it is argued that costs go down as all its specialists become efficient by working on one \"production line\" procedure.<ref name=bbc1/>\n\n===Teaching===\n[[File:McMasterUMedical.jpg|thumb|right|[[McMaster University Medical Centre]] is a teaching hospital in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]]]\nA [[teaching hospital]] combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses and often is linked to a medical school, nursing school or university.\nIn some countries like UK exists the clinical attachment system that is defined as a period of time when a doctor is attached to a named supervisor in a clinical unit, with the broad aims of observing clinical practice in the UK and the role of doctors and other healthcare professionals in the National Health Service (NHS).\n\n===Clinics===\n{{main|Clinic}}\nThe medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a [[clinic]], and often is run by a [[government agency]] for health services or a private [[partnership]] of physicians (in nations where private practice is allowed).

Hospitals may have acute services such as an [[emergency department]] or specialist [[trauma center]], [[Burn (injury)|burn unit]], [[surgery]], or [[urgent care]]. These may then be backed up by more specialist units such as the following:\n* [[Emergency department]]\n* [[Cardiology]]\n* [[Intensive care unit]]\n** [[Paediatric intensive care unit]]\n** [[Neonatal intensive care unit]]\n** Cardiovascular intensive care unit\n* [[Neurology]]\n* [[Oncology]]\n* [[Obstetrics and gynaecology]], colloquially, [[maternity ward]]\n\nIn addition, there is the [[Nursing management|department of nursing]], often headed by a [[chief nursing officer]] or [[Nursing management#Director of nursing|director of nursing]]. This department is responsible for the administration of professional nursing practice, [[Nursing research|research]], and policy for the hospital. Nursing permeates every part of a hospital. Many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty. For example, in an intensive care nursery, the director of neonatology is responsible for the medical staff and medical care while the nursing manager/director for the intensive care nursery is responsible for all of the nurses and nursing care in that unit/ward.\n\nSome hospitals have [[outpatient|outpatient departments]] and some have chronic treatment units such as [[behavioral health]] services, [[dentistry]], [[dermatology]], [[psychiatric ward]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation services]], and [[physical therapy]].\n\nCommon support units include a [[dispensary]] or [[hospital pharmacy|pharmacy]], [[pathology]], and [[radiology]]. Hospitals also have a mortuary, where the dead are stored. On the non-medical side, there often are [[medical records department]]s, [[release of information department]]s, information management ({{aka}} IM, IT or IS), [[clinical engineering]] (a.k.a. biomed), facilities management, plant ops (operations, also known as maintenance), dining services, and security departments.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of hospitals}}\n{{see also|Timeline of hospitals}}\n\n=== Early examples ===\n{{Further|Ancient Iranian medicine|Byzantine medicine}}\n[[File:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|right|thumb|View of the ''Askleipion'' of [[Kos]], the best preserved instance of an Asklepieion.]]\nThe earliest documented institutions aiming to provide cures were [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temples]].

Islamic hospitals tended to be large, urban structures, and were largely secular institutions, many open to all, whether male or female, civilian or military, child or adult, rich or poor, Muslim or non-Muslim.

By the 1870s, hospitals had more than trebled their original average intake of 3,000 patients. In continental Europe the new hospitals generally were built and run from public funds. The [[National Health Service]], the principal provider of health care in the United Kingdom, was founded in 1948. During the nineteenth century, the Second Viennese Medical School emerged with the contributions of physicians such as [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]], [[Josef \u0160koda]], [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra]], and [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]]. Basic medical science expanded and specialisation advanced.

Hospital care is thus relatively easily available to all legal residents, although free emergency care is available to anyone, regardless of nationality or status.

Independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and [[hospital accreditation]] is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as [[international healthcare accreditation]], by groups such as [[Accreditation Canada]] from [[Canada]], the [[Joint Commission]] from the US, the [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]] from Great Britain, and Haute Authorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (HAS) from France.\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] noted in 2011 that going into hospital was far riskier than flying.  Globally the chance of a patient being subject to an error was about 10%  and the chance of death resulting from an error was about 1 in 300 according to [[Liam Donaldson]]. 7% of hospitalised patients in developed countries, and 10% in developing countries, acquire at least one health care-associated infection. In the USA 1.7 million infections are acquired in hospital each year, leading to 100,000 deaths, figures much worse than in Europe where there were 4.5 million infections and 37,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Going into hospital far riskier than flying: WHO |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safety/going-into-hospital-far-riskier-than-flying-who-idUSTRE76K45R20110721 |accessdate=27 January 2019 |publisher=Reuters |date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:UVa Medical Center.jpg|thumb|The medical center at the [[University of Virginia]] shows the growing trend for modern architecture in hospitals.]]\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:NHS NNUH entrance.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|The [[National Health Service]] [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]] in the UK, showing the utilitarian architecture of many modern hospitals]]\n[[File:Fawcett Memorial Hospital Chapel.jpg|right|upright=0.8|thumb|Hospital chapel at [[Fawcett Memorial Hospital]] ([[Port Charlotte, Florida]])]]\n\nModern hospital buildings are designed to minimise the effort of medical personnel and the possibility of contamination while maximising the efficiency of the whole system. Travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised. The building also should be built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring, plumbing, and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.<ref>[[Annmarie Adams]], ''Medicine by Design: The Architect and the Modern Hospital, 1893\u20131943'' (2009)</ref>\n\nHowever, many hospitals, even those considered \"modern\", are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or even centuries, with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and finances dictate. As a result, Dutch architectural historian [[Cor Wagenaar]] has called many hospitals:\n\n:''\"...&nbsp;built catastrophes, anonymous institutional complexes run by vast bureaucracies, and totally unfit for the purpose they have been designed for&nbsp;...

These ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century, when the concept of providing fresh air and access to the 'healing powers of nature' were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings.<ref name=\"ODE\"/>\n\nThe research of [[British Medical Association]] is showing that good hospital design can reduce patient's recovery time. Exposure to daylight is effective in reducing depression. Single-sex accommodation help ensure that patients are treated in privacy and with dignity. Exposure to nature and hospital gardens is also important \u2013 looking out windows improves patients' moods and reduces blood pressure and stress level.
