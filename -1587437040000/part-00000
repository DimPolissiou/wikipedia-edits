English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son escape from a burning ship. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of [[gorillas]], and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage [[leopard]] named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid [[African forest elephant|elephant]] named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a [[baboon]] troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan examines Jane and realizes that she is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and violently attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. An enraged Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, which causes Tarzan to run off in a fit of guilt. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and shows him his true past. Tarzan dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to actually capture the gorillas and sell them to a zoo for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the ship's hull. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Kerchak gives his life to protect Tarzan by charging between him and Clayton's shotgun and is shot dead in the process. Clayton fights Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares his life and destroys his gun, Clayton tries to kill him with his machete. After Tarzan traps Clayton in vines, Clayton, in a blind fury, slashes the vines with his machete except for one tangled around his throat, causing him to fall from the tree, mortally hanging him. A dying Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully passing away.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a 20-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child. John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan's animation.<ref name=\"Green\" /> [[Brian Blessed]] provided the [[Tarzan yell]], while Goldwyn provided Tarzan's speaking voice.\n:*[[Alex D. Linz]] as young Tarzan\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the eccentric, feisty, kind-hearted, and intelligent daughter of Professor Porter. She is the first of the group to encounter Tarzan and becomes his love interest. Ken Duncan served as the supervising animator for Jane. Many of Driver's mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane's animation. The scene where Jane describes meeting Tarzan for the first time to her father and Clayton was improvised by Driver, resulting in Ken Duncan animating one of the longest animated scenes on record. The scene took 7 weeks to animate and 73 feet of film.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], Tarzan's adoptive mother, who found and raised him after losing her biological son to Sabor. She is also Kerchak's mate.

Smith]] served as the supervising animator for Kerchak.\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as [[William Cecil Clayton|William Clayton]], an intelligent and suave - yet arrogant and treacherous - hunter, who guides the Porters on their quest. Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Clayton, basing his design on [[Clark Gable]] and other film stars of the 1930s and 40s.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, an eccentric, short-statured scientist and Jane's father. Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter. This was Hawthorne's final voice acting role before his death in 2001.\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Terk (short for Terkina, a feminization of Terkoz merged with Teeka), Tarzan's best friend, a wisecracking gorilla. She is also Kala and Kerchak's niece, making her and Tarzan adoptive cousins. Michael Surrey served as the supervising animator for Terk.\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Tantor]], a paranoid and submissive elephant, and Tarzan and Terk's close friend. [[Sergio Pablos]] served as the supervising animator for Tantor.\n:*Taylor Dempsey as young Tantor. \n* [[Erik von Detten]] and [[Jason Marsden]] as Flynt and Mungo, a duo of young gorillas who are friends with Terk.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDisney's ''Tarzan'' was the first Tarzan film to be animated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whipp|first=Glenn|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|title=With Tarzan, It's A Disney Jungle Out There|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407132030/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|date=June 16, 1999|accessdate=September 29, 2014|archivedate=April 7, 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com}}</ref> [[Thomas Schumacher]], the President of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], expressed surprise that there weren't any previous attempts to animate a ''Tarzan'' film, saying, \"Here is a book that cries out to be animated.

Following Katzenberg's resignation from the [[Walt Disney Company]], Lima was again contacted about the project by [[Michael Eisner]], who decided to have the film produced through the Feature Animation division by which Lima signed on.<ref>{{cite interview|title=Get Enchanted!

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" />\n\nIn January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo [[Bob Tzudiker]] and [[Noni White]] were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" /> Comedy writer [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|Dave Reynolds]] was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.<ref name=\"Animation Artist\">{{cite news| url=http://www.animationartist.com/movies/tarzan/Production/production.html | title=Disney's Tarzan Adventure: Two Worlds Merge | last=Tracy | first=Joe | publisher=Animation Artist | accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> \"I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up\", Reynolds said, \"A year and a half later, I finished.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.

Expanded to support moving objects as part of the background, ''Deep Canvas'' was used to create about 75 percent of the environments in Disney's next major animated action film, ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' (2002).\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Tarzan (1999 soundtrack)}}\nIn 1995, [[Phil Collins]] was initially brought onto the project as a songwriter following a recommendation by Disney music executive Chris Montan.

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and fights Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares his life and destroys his shotgun, Clayton tries to kill him with his machete. After Tarzan traps Clayton in vines, Clayton wildly slashes the vines with his machete, causing him to fall from the tree with a vine tangled around his throat, hanging and killing him. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a 20-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child. John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan's animation.<ref name=\"Green\" /> [[Brian Blessed]] provided the [[Tarzan yell]], while Goldwyn provided Tarzan's speaking voice.\n:*[[Alex D. Linz]] as young Tarzan\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the eccentric, feisty, kind-hearted, and intelligent daughter of Professor Porter. She is the first of the group to encounter Tarzan and becomes his love interest. Ken Duncan served as the supervising animator for Jane. Many of Driver's mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane's animation. The scene where Jane describes meeting Tarzan for the first time to her father and Clayton was improvised by Driver, resulting in Ken Duncan animating one of the longest animated scenes on record. The scene took 7 weeks to animate and 73 feet of film.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], Tarzan's adoptive mother, who found and raised him after losing her biological son to Sabor. She is also Kerchak's mate. [[Russ Edmonds]] served as the supervising animator for Kala.\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Kerchak]], Kala's mate and the leader of the gorilla troop who struggles to accept Tarzan. [[Bruce W. Smith]] served as the supervising animator for Kerchak.\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as [[William Cecil Clayton|William Clayton]], an intelligent and suave - yet arrogant and treacherous - hunter, who guides the Porters on their quest. Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Clayton, basing his design on [[Clark Gable]] and other film stars of the 1930s and 40s.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, an eccentric, short-statured scientist and Jane's father. Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter. This was Hawthorne's final voice acting role before his death in 2001.\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Terk (short for Terkina, a feminization of Terkoz merged with Teeka), Tarzan's best friend, a wisecracking gorilla. She is also Kala and Kerchak's niece, making her and Tarzan adoptive cousins. Michael Surrey served as the supervising animator for Terk.\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Tantor]], a paranoid and submissive elephant, and Tarzan and Terk's close friend. [[Sergio Pablos]] served as the supervising animator for Tantor.\n:*Taylor Dempsey as young Tantor. \n* [[Erik von Detten]] and [[Jason Marsden]] as Flynt and Mungo, a duo of young gorillas who are friends with Terk.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDisney's ''Tarzan'' was the first Tarzan film to be animated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whipp|first=Glenn|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|title=With Tarzan, It's A Disney Jungle Out There|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407132030/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|date=June 16, 1999|accessdate=September 29, 2014|archivedate=April 7, 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com}}</ref> [[Thomas Schumacher]], the President of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], expressed surprise that there weren't any previous attempts to animate a ''Tarzan'' film, saying, \"Here is a book that cries out to be animated.

Following Katzenberg's resignation from the [[Walt Disney Company]], Lima was again contacted about the project by [[Michael Eisner]], who decided to have the film produced through the Feature Animation division by which Lima signed on.<ref>{{cite interview|title=Get Enchanted!

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" />\n\nIn January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo [[Bob Tzudiker]] and [[Noni White]] were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" /> Comedy writer [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|Dave Reynolds]] was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.<ref name=\"Animation Artist\">{{cite news| url=http://www.animationartist.com/movies/tarzan/Production/production.html | title=Disney's Tarzan Adventure: Two Worlds Merge | last=Tracy | first=Joe | publisher=Animation Artist | accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> \"I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up\", Reynolds said, \"A year and a half later, I finished. Either they liked my work, or I was very bad at time management.\"<ref name=\"Green\" /> One challenge the writers faced was how Tarzan should learn about his past. \"When Kala takes Tarzan back to the tree house, she is essentially telling him that he was adopted\", [[Bonnie Arnold]], the producer for ''Tarzan'', said, \"This is necessitated by him encountering humans and recognizing he is one of them.\"<ref name=\"Green\" /> As a way to explore the feelings in that scene, Arnold brought in adoptive parents to talk with the story team.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Another issue was the inherent and overt racism in the original Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan.

However, Katzenberg persuaded Allen to leave the project for [[DreamWorks Pictures]]' ''[[Antz]]'' and in exchange, the studio would distribute his next four films.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy.

These probably took place during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] of Northern Europe from c. 500 BC. [[Proto-Germanic]] itself was likely spoken after c. 500 BC,{{sfnp|Ringe|2006|p=67}} and [[Proto-Norse]] from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from [[Proto-Indo-European]] suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the [[Nordic Bronze Age]].\n\nFrom the time of their earliest attestation, the Germanic varieties are divided into three groups:  [[West Germanic languages|West]], [[East Germanic languages|East]], and [[North Germanic languages|North]] Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions.\n\nThe western group would have formed in the late [[Jastorf culture]], and the eastern group may be derived from the 1st-century [[Old Gutnish|variety]] of [[Gotland]], leaving southern Sweden as the original location of the northern group. The earliest period of [[Elder Futhark]] (2nd to 4th centuries) predates the division in regional script variants, and linguistically essentially still reflect the [[Common Germanic]] stage. [[Vimose inscriptions]] AD 160, are the oldest Germanic writing.\n\nThe earliest coherent Germanic text preserved is the 4th-century [[Gothic language|Gothic]] translation of the [[New Testament]] by [[Ulfilas]]. Early testimonies of West Germanic are in [[Old Frankish]]/[[Old Dutch]] (the 5th-century [[Bergakker inscription]]), [[Old High German]] (scattered words and sentences 6th century and coherent texts 9th century), and [[Old English language|Old English]] (oldest texts 650, coherent texts 10th century). North Germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions, as [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], until it evolves into [[Old Norse]] by about 800.\n\nLonger runic inscriptions survive from the 8th and 9th centuries ([[Eggjum stone]], [[R\u00f6k stone]]), longer texts in the Latin alphabet survive from the 12th century ([[\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k]]), and some [[skaldic poetry]] dates back to as early as the 9th century.\n\nBy about the 10th century, the varieties had diverged enough to make [[mutual intelligibility|inter-comprehensibility]] difficult. The linguistic contact of the [[Viking]] settlers of the [[Danelaw]] with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] left traces in the English language and is suspected to have facilitated the collapse of Old English grammar that resulted in [[Middle English]] from the 12th century.\n\nThe East Germanic languages were marginalized from the end of the Migration period. The [[Burgundians]], [[Goths]], and [[Vandals]] became linguistically assimilated by their respective neighbors by about the 7th century, with only [[Crimean Gothic language|Crimean Gothic]] lingering on until the 18th century.\n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, the West Germanic languages were separated by the insular development of Middle English on one hand and by the [[High German consonant shift]] on the continent on the other, resulting in [[Upper German]] and [[Low German|Low Saxon]], with graded intermediate [[Central German]] varieties. By early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]] in the South to [[Northern Low Saxon]] in the North, and, although both extremes are considered German, they are hardly mutually intelligible. The southernmost varieties had completed the second sound shift, while the northern varieties remained unaffected by the consonant shift.\n\nThe North Germanic languages, on the other hand, remained unified until well past 1000 AD, and in fact the mainland Scandinavian languages still largely retain mutual intelligibility into modern times.  The main split in these languages is between the mainland languages and the island languages to the west, especially [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which has maintained the grammar of [[Old Norse]] virtually unchanged, while the mainland languages have diverged greatly.\n\n==Distinctive characteristics==\nGermanic languages possess a number of defining features compared with other Indo-European languages.\n\nProbably the most well-known are the following:\n# The [[sound change]]s known as [[Grimm's Law]] and [[Verner's Law]], which shifted the values of all the Indo-European stop consonants (for example, original *{{IPA|/t d d\u02b0/}} became Germanic *{{IPA|/\u03b8 t d/}} in most cases; compare ''three'' with [[Latin]] {{lang|la|tres}}, ''two'' with Latin {{lang|la|duo}}, ''do'' with [[Sanskrit]] {{transl|sa|dha-}}). The recognition of these two sound laws were seminal events in the understanding of the regular nature of linguistic sound change and the development of the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]], which forms the basis of modern [[historical linguistics]].\n# The development of a strong [[stress (language)|stress]] on the first syllable of the word, which triggered significant phonological reduction of all other syllables. This is responsible for the reduction of most of the basic English, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish words into monosyllables, and the common impression of modern English and German as consonant-heavy languages. Examples are Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*strangi\u00fe\u014d}} \u2192 ''strength'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*aimaitij\u014d}} \u2192 ''ant'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*haubud\u0105}} \u2192 ''head'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hauzijan\u0105}}  \u2192 ''hear'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*harubistaz}} \u2192 German {{lang|de|Herbst}} \"autumn, harvest\", {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hagatusj\u014d}} \u2192 German {{lang|de|Hexe}} \"witch, hag\".\n# A change known as [[Germanic umlaut]], which modified vowel qualities when a high front vocalic segment ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}) followed in the next syllable.  Generally, back vowels were fronted, and front vowels were raised. In many languages, the modified vowels are indicated with a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (e.g., {{lang|de|\u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc}} in German, pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b \u00f8 y/}}, respectively). This change resulted in pervasive alternations in related words \u2014 still extremely prominent in modern German but present only in remnants in modern English (e.g., ''mouse/mice'', ''goose/geese'', ''broad/breadth'', ''tell/told'', ''old/elder'', ''foul/filth'', ''gold/gild''<ref>These alternations are no longer easily distinguishable from vowel alternations due to earlier changes (e.g. [[Indo-European ablaut]], as in ''write/wrote/written'', ''sing/sang/sung'', ''hold/held'') or later changes (e.g. vowel shortening in [[Middle English]], as in ''wide/width'', ''lead/led'').</ref>).\n# Large numbers of vowel qualities. English is typical in this respect, with around 11\u201312 vowels in most dialects (not counting diphthongs). [[Standard Swedish]] has 17 [[Monophthong|pure vowels (monophthongs)]],{{sfnp|Wang|Ding|Tao|Li|2012|p=657}} standard German and Dutch 14, and [[Danish language|Danish]] at least 11.{{sfnp|Basb\u00f8ll|Jacobsen|2003}} The Amstetten dialect of [[Bavarian German]] has 13 distinctions among long vowels alone, one of the largest such inventories in the world.<ref>{{SOWL|290}}</ref>\n# ''[[V2 word order|Verb second]]'' (V2) word order, which is uncommon cross-linguistically. Exactly one noun phrase or adverbial element must precede the verb; in particular, if an adverb or prepositional phrase precedes the verb, then the subject must immediately follow the finite verb. This is now largely absent in modern English, except in sentences beginning with \"Here is,\" \"There is,\" \"Here comes,\" \"There goes,\" and related expressions, as well as in a few relic sentences such as \"Over went the boat\" or \"[[Pop Goes The Weasel]]\", but is found in all other modern Germanic languages.\n\nOther significant characteristics are:\n# The reduction of the various [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] combinations of the Indo-European verbal system into only two: the [[present tense]] and the [[past tense]] (also called the [[preterite]]).\n# A large class of verbs that use a dental [[suffix]] ({{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}) instead of [[Apophony|vowel alternation]] ([[Indo-European ablaut]]) to indicate past tense. These are called the [[Germanic weak verb]]s; the remaining verbs with vowel ablaut are the [[Germanic strong verb]]s.\n# A distinction in [[definiteness]] of a [[noun phrase]] that is marked by different sets of inflectional endings for [[adjectives]], the so-called strong and weak [[adjective]]s. A similar development happened in the [[Balto-Slavic languages]]. This distinction has been lost in modern English but was present in [[Old English]] and remains in all other Germanic languages to various degrees.\n# Some words with etymologies that are difficult to link to other Indo-European families but with variants that appear in almost all Germanic languages. See [[Germanic substrate hypothesis]].\n\nNote that some of the above characteristics were not present in Proto-Germanic but developed later as [[areal feature]]s that spread from language to language:\n* Germanic umlaut only affected the [[North Germanic languages|North]] and [[West Germanic languages]] (which represent all modern Germanic languages) but not the now-extinct [[East Germanic languages]], such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], nor [[Proto-Germanic]], the common ancestor of all Germanic languages.\n* The large inventory of vowel qualities is a later development, due to a combination of Germanic umlaut and the tendency in many Germanic languages for pairs of long/short vowels of originally identical quality to develop distinct qualities, with the length distinction sometimes eventually lost. Proto-Germanic had only five distinct vowel qualities, although there were more actual vowel phonemes because length and possibly nasality were phonemic. In modern German, long-short vowel pairs still exist but are also distinct in quality.\n* Proto-Germanic probably had a more general S-O-V-I word order. However, the tendency toward V2 order may have already been present in latent form and may be related to [[Wackernagel's Law]], an Indo-European law dictating that sentence [[clitic]]s must be placed second.<ref>According to [[Donald Ringe]], cf. {{Harvcoltxt|Ringe|2006|p=295}}</ref>\n\nRoughly speaking, Germanic languages differ in how conservative or how progressive each language is with respect to an overall trend toward [[analytic language|analyticity]]. Some, such as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and, to a lesser extent, German, have preserved much of the complex [[inflectional morphology]] inherited from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] (and in turn from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]). Others, such as English, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Afrikaans]], have moved toward a largely analytic type.\n\n==Linguistic developments==\n\nThe subgroupings of the Germanic languages are defined by shared innovations.  It is important to distinguish innovations from cases of linguistic conservatism.  That is, if two languages in a family share a characteristic that is not observed in a third language, that is evidence of common ancestry of the two languages ''only if'' the characteristic is an innovation compared to the family's [[proto-language]].\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages (all but [[Gothic language|Gothic]]):\n* The lowering of /u/ to /o/ in initial syllables before /a/ in the following syllable (\"a-Umlaut\", traditionally called ''Brechung'')\n* \"Labial umlaut\" in unstressed medial syllables (the conversion of /a/ to /u/ and /\u014d/ to /\u016b/ before /m/, or /u/ in the following syllable){{sfnp|Campbell|1983|p=139}}\n* The conversion of /\u0113<sub>1</sub>/ into /\u0101/ (vs. Gothic /\u0113/) in stressed syllables.<ref>But see {{Harvcoltxt|Cercignani|1972}}</ref> In unstressed syllables, West Germanic also has this change, but North Germanic has shortened the vowel to /e/, then raised it to /i/.

Cf. modern English plural ''-(e)s'', but German plural ''-e''.\n* Possibly, the [[monophthong]]ization of Germanic ''*ai'' to ''\u0113/\u0101'' (this may represent independent changes in Old Saxon and [[Anglo-Frisian]]).\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Anglo-Frisian]] subgroup of the [[Ingvaeonic languages]]:\n* Raising of nasalized ''a, \u0101'' into ''o, \u014d''.\n* [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]]: Fronting of non-nasal ''a, \u0101'' to ''\u00e6,\u01e3'' when not followed by ''n'' or ''m''.\n* [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] of ''CrV'' into ''CVr'', where ''C'' represents any consonant and ''V'' any vowel.\n* [[Monophthongization]] of ''ai'' into ''\u0101''.\n\n==Common linguistic features==\n===Phonology===\nThe oldest Germanic languages all share a number of features, which are assumed to be inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]]. Phonologically, it includes the important sound changes known as [[Grimm's Law]] and [[Verner's Law]], which introduced a large number of [[fricative]]s; late [[Proto-Indo-European]] had only one, /s/.\n\nThe main vowel developments are the merging (in most circumstances) of long and short /a/ and /o/, producing short /a/ and long /\u014d/. That likewise affected the [[diphthong]]s, with PIE /ai/ and /oi/ merging into /ai/ and PIE /au/ and /ou/ merging into /au/. PIE /ei/ developed into long /\u012b/. PIE long /\u0113/ developed into a vowel denoted as /\u0113<sub>1</sub>/ (often assumed to be phonetically {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}), while a new, fairly uncommon long vowel /\u0113<sub>2</sub>/ developed in varied and not completely understood circumstances. Proto-Germanic had no [[front rounded vowel]]s, but all Germanic languages except for [[Gothic language|Gothic]] subsequently developed them through the process of [[i-umlaut]].\n\nProto-Germanic developed a strong stress accent on the first syllable of the root, but remnants of the original free PIE accent are visible due to Verner's Law, which was sensitive to this accent. That caused a steady erosion of vowels in unstressed syllables. In Proto-Germanic, that had progressed only to the point that absolutely-final short vowels (other than /i/ and /u/) were lost and absolutely-final long vowels were shortened, but all of the early literary languages show a more advanced state of vowel loss. This ultimately resulted in some languages (like Modern English) losing practically all vowels following the main stress and the consequent rise of a very large number of monosyllabic words.\n\n====Table of outcomes====\nThe following table shows the main outcomes of Proto-Germanic vowels and consonants in the various older languages. For vowels, only the outcomes in stressed syllables are shown. Outcomes in unstressed syllables are quite different, vary from language to language and depend on a number of other factors (such as whether the syllable was medial or final, whether the syllable was [[open syllable|open]] or [[closed syllable|closed]] and (in some cases) whether the preceding syllable was [[light syllable|light]] or [[heavy syllable|heavy]]).\n\nNotes:\n* ''C-'' means before a vowel (word-initially, or sometimes after a consonant).\n* ''-C-'' means between vowels.\n* ''-C'' means after a vowel (word-finally or before a consonant). Word-final outcomes generally occurred ''after'' deletion of final short vowels, which occurred shortly after Proto-Germanic and is reflected in the history of all written languages except for [[Proto-Norse]].\n* The above three are given in the order ''C-'', ''-C-'', ''-C''. If one is omitted, the previous one applies. For example, ''f, -[v]-'' means that ''[v]'' occurs after a vowel regardless of what follows.\n* Something like ''a(\u2026u)'' means \"''a'' if /u/ occurs in the next syllable\".\n* Something like ''a(n)'' means \"''a'' if /n/ immediately follows\".\n* Something like ''(n)a'' means \"''a'' if /n/ immediately precedes\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Development of Germanic sounds\n!

(Pre-)Gothic<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"pre-gothic\">The [[Gothic language#Alphabet and transliteration|Gothic writing system]] uses the spelling {{angbr|ai}} to represent vowels that derive primarily from four different sources:\n# Proto-Germanic /ai/\n# Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} before vowels\n# Proto-Germanic /e/ and /i/ before /h/, /h\u02b7/ and /r/\n# Greek {{IPA|/\u025b/}}.\nThe spelling {{angbr|au}} is similarly used to represent vowels primarily deriving from the following four sources:\n# Proto-Germanic /au/\n# Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} before vowels\n# Proto-Germanic /u/ before /h/, /h\u02b7/ and /r/\n# Greek {{IPA|/\u0254/}}.\nIt is generally agreed that the outcome of case 2 was pronounced {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0/\u0254\u02d0]}} in Gothic, distinct from the vowels written {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|o}}, which were pronounced {{IPA|[e\u02d0/o\u02d0]}}. Likewise, it is generally agreed that the outcomes of cases 3 and 4 were pronounced {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254]}} in Gothic.  However, there is some argument over whether the outcomes of case 1 were still pronounced as diphthongs {{IPA|[ai/au]}}, as in Proto-Germanic, or had merged with case 2 as monophthongs {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0/\u0254\u02d0]}}. There is some historical evidence (particularly from Latin spelling variations of ''Gaut-'' vs. ''G\u014dt-'', used to represent the name of the Goths) that the Proto-Germanic diphthongs had changed into monophthongs shortly before (i.e., within a century of) the time of [[Wulfila]], who designed the Gothic alphabet and wrote the [[Gothic Bible]] c. 360 AD. This accords with the fact that Wulfila used the same symbols {{angbr|ai/au}} to represent all the outcomes, despite the fact that the spellings {{angbr|aj/aw}} were available to unambiguously represent diphthongs (and, in fact, alternate with {{angbr|ai/au}} in a number of nominal and verbal paradigms). The use of the spelling {{angbr|ai}} to represent a monophthong {{IPA|[\u025b(\u02d0)]}} was evidently in imitation of 4th century Greek, where {{angbr|ai}} likewise stood for {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, and {{angbr|au}} was apparently created by analogy. Consistent with many sources, such as {{Harvcoltxt|Bennett|1980}}, the phonology described here is that of \"Pre-Gothic\" (i.e., the phonology of Gothic just before the monophthongization of /ai/ and /au/).</ref>{{sfnp|Bennett|1980}}{{sfnp|Wright|1919}} !!

Some vowels were affected similarly, but only by a following /w/; this process is sometimes termed ''w-umlaut''. These processes operated after [[i-umlaut]].  ''U-umlaut'' (by a following /u/ or /w/) caused /a/, /ja/ (broken /e/), /a\u02d0/, and /e/ to round to /\u0254/ (written ''o\u0327''), /j\u0254/ (written ''jo\u0327''), /\u0254\u02d0/ (written ''\u00f3\u0327'' and later unrounded again to /a\u02d0/), and /\u00f8/, respectively.  The vowels /i/ and /ai/ rounded to /y/ and /ey/, respectively, only before /w/.

All languages except Gothic were affected, although there are various exceptions in all the languages.  Two similar process later operated:\n* In Old High German, /iu/ (from Proto-Germanic /eu/,/iu/) became /io/ before a non-high vowel in the next syllable.\n* In Old English, /\u00e6/ (from Proto-Germanic /a/) became /a/ before /a/ in the next syllable.\nAll of these processes were blocked in an i-umlaut context (i.e. by a following /j/).</ref> a/o(n), \u00e6\u0306\u0103(h,rC,lC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\">The diphthongal results are due to [[Old English breaking]].  In general, front vowels break into diphthongs before some subset of ''h'', ''w'', ''rC'', and ''lC'', where ''C'' is a consonant.  The diphthong /\u00e6a/ is written ''ea''; /eo/ is written ''eo''; /iu/ is written ''io''; and /iy/ is written ''ie''. All diphthongs umlaut to /iy/ ''ie''. All diphthongs occur both long and short. Note that there is significant dispute about the actual pronunciation of ''io'' and (especially) ''ie''.

This was the most significant of the various [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] processes operating in the Germanic languages, and caused back vowels to become fronted, and front vowels to be raised, when /i/, /i\u02d0/ or /j/ followed in the next syllable.  The term ''i-umlaut'' actually refers to two separate processes that both were triggered in the same environment.  The earlier process raised /e/ and /eu/ to /i/ and /iu/, respectively, and may have operated still in Proto-Germanic (with its effects in Gothic obscured due to later changes).  The later process affected all back vowels and some front vowels; it operated independently in the various languages, occurring at differing times with differing results.  Old English was the earliest and most-affected language, with nearly all vowels affected.  Old High German was the last language to be affected; the only written evidence of the process is with short /a/, which is umlauted to /e/.  However, later evidence suggests that other back vowels were also affected, perhaps still sub-phonemically in Old High German times.

The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing.  There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE [[optative mood]]) and imperative.  Gothic verbs had a number of archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE [[mediopassive voice]]), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect).  The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. ''In three months, the house will still be being built'' or ''If you had not acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught'') is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).\n\nAmong the primary innovations in Proto-Germanic are the [[preterite present verb]]s, a special set of verbs whose present tense looks like the past tense of other verbs and which is the origin of most [[modal verb]]s in English; a past-tense ending (in the so-called \"weak verbs\", marked with ''-ed'' in English) that appears variously as /d/ or /t/, often assumed to be derived from the verb \"to do\"; and two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (\"a man\", with a combination of PIE adjective and pronoun endings) and definite semantics (\"the man\", with endings derived from PIE ''n''-stem nouns).\n\nNote that most modern Germanic languages have lost most of the inherited inflectional morphology as a result of the steady attrition of unstressed endings triggered by the strong initial stress. (Contrast, for example, the [[Balto-Slavic languages]], which have largely kept the Indo-European [[pitch accent]] and consequently preserved much of the inherited morphology.) [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to a lesser extent modern German best preserve the Proto\u2013Germanic inflectional system, with four noun cases, three genders, and well-marked verbs. English and Afrikaans are at the other extreme, with almost no remaining inflectional morphology.\n\nThe following shows a typical masculine ''a''-stem noun, Proto-Germanic ''*fiskaz'' (\"fish\"), and its development in the various old literary languages:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Declension of ''a''-stem noun ''*fiskaz'' \"fish\" in various languages{{sfnp|Ringe|2006}}{{sfnp|Lass|1994}}{{sfnp|Helfenstein|1870}}\n! colspan=2 | !!

The most common class (the ''o/\u0101'' class) used a combination of ''o''-stem endings for masculine and neuter genders and ''\u0101''-stems ending for feminine genders, but other common classes (e.g. the ''i'' class and ''u'' class) used endings from a single vowel-stem declension for all genders, and various other classes existed that were based on other declensions. A quite different set of \"pronominal\" endings was used for pronouns, [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]], and words with related semantics (e.g., \"all\", \"only\").\n\nAn important innovation in Proto-Germanic was the development of two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (\"a man\") and definite semantics (\"the man\"). The endings of indefinite adjectives were derived from a combination of pronominal endings with one of the common vowel-stem adjective declensions \u2013 usually the ''o/\u0101'' class (often termed the ''a/\u014d'' class in the specific context of the Germanic languages) but sometimes the ''i'' or ''u'' classes. Definite adjectives, however, had endings based on ''n''-stem nouns.  Originally both types of adjectives could be used by themselves, but already by Proto-Germanic times a pattern evolved whereby definite adjectives had to be accompanied by a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] with definite semantics (e.g., a [[definite article]], [[demonstrative pronoun]], [[possessive pronoun]], or the like), while indefinite adjectives were used in other circumstances (either accompanied by a word with indefinite semantics such as \"a\", \"one\", or \"some\" or unaccompanied).\n\nIn the 19th century, the two types of adjectives \u2013 indefinite and definite \u2013 were respectively termed \"strong\" and \"weak\", names which are still commonly used. These names were based on the appearance of the two sets of endings in modern German. In German, the distinctive case endings formerly present on nouns have largely disappeared, with the result that the load of distinguishing one case from another is almost entirely carried by determiners and adjectives. Furthermore, due to regular sound change, the various definite (''n''-stem) adjective endings coalesced to the point where only two endings (''-e'' and ''-en'') remain in modern German to express the sixteen possible inflectional categories of the language (masculine/feminine/neuter/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive \u2013 modern German merges all genders in the plural). The indefinite (''a/\u014d''-stem) adjective endings were less affected by sound change, with six endings remaining (''-, -e, -es, -er, -em, -en''), cleverly distributed in a way that is capable of expressing the various inflectional categories without too much ambiguity. As a result, the definite endings were thought of as too \"weak\" to carry inflectional meaning and in need of \"strengthening\" by the presence of an accompanying determiner, while the indefinite endings were viewed as \"strong\" enough to indicate the inflectional categories even when standing alone. (This view is enhanced by the fact that modern German largely uses weak-ending adjectives when accompanying an indefinite article, and hence the indefinite/definite distinction no longer clearly applies.) By analogy, the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" were extended to the corresponding noun classes, with ''a''-stem and ''\u014d''-stem nouns termed \"strong\" and ''n''-stem nouns termed \"weak\".\n\nHowever, in Proto-Germanic \u2013 and still in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], the most conservative Germanic language \u2013 the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" are not clearly appropriate. For one thing, there were a large number of noun declensions. The ''a''-stem, ''\u014d''-stem, and ''n''-stem declensions were the most common and represented targets into which the other declensions were eventually absorbed, but this process occurred only gradually. Originally the ''n''-stem declension was not a single declension but a set of separate declensions (e.g., ''-an'', ''-\u014dn'', ''-\u012bn'') with related endings, and these endings were in no way any \"weaker\" than the endings of any other declensions. (For example, among the eight possible inflectional categories of a noun \u2014 singular/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive \u2014 masculine ''an''-stem nouns in Gothic include seven endings, and feminine ''\u014dn''-stem nouns include six endings, meaning there is very little ambiguity of \"weakness\" in these endings and in fact much less than in the German \"strong\" endings.) Although it is possible to group the various noun declensions into three basic categories \u2014 vowel-stem, ''n''-stem, and other-consonant-stem (a.k.a. \"minor declensions\") \u2014 the vowel-stem nouns do not display any sort of unity in their endings that supports grouping them together with each other but separate from the ''n''-stem endings.\n\nIt is only in later languages that the binary distinction between \"strong\" and \"weak\" nouns become more relevant. In [[Old English]], the ''n''-stem nouns form a single, clear class, but the masculine ''a''-stem and feminine ''\u014d''-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and neither has much similarity to the small class of ''u''-stem nouns. Similarly, in [[Old Norse]], the masculine ''a''-stem and feminine ''\u014d''-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and the continuations of the masculine ''an''-stem and feminine ''\u014dn/\u012bn''-stem nouns are also quite distinct. It is only in [[Middle Dutch]] and modern German that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged to the point that a binary strong/weak distinction clearly applies.\n\nAs a result, newer grammatical descriptions of the Germanic languages often avoid the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" except in conjunction with German itself, preferring instead to use the terms \"indefinite\" and \"definite\" for adjectives and to distinguish nouns by their actual stem class.\n\nIn English, both two sets of adjective endings were lost entirely in the late [[Middle English]] period.\n\n==Classification==<!-- This section is linked from [[American and British English differences]] -->\nNote that divisions between and among subfamilies of Germanic are rarely precisely defined; most form continuous clines, with adjacent [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not.

Early runic inscriptions also are largely limited to personal names and difficult to interpret. The [[Gothic language]] was written in the [[Gothic alphabet]] developed by Bishop [[Ulfilas]] for his translation of the [[Bible]] in the 4th century.<ref>[[Fausto Cercignani|Cercignani, Fausto]], ''The Elaboration of the Gothic Alphabet and Orthography'', in \"Indogermanische Forschungen\", 93, 1988, pp. 168\u2013185.</ref> Later, [[Christianity|Christian]] priests and monks who spoke and read [[Latin]] in addition to their native Germanic varieties began writing the Germanic languages with slightly modified Latin letters. However, throughout the [[Viking Age]], runic alphabets remained in common use in Scandinavia.\n\nIn addition to the standard [[Latin script]], many Germanic languages use a variety of [[diacritic|accent marks]] and extra letters, including the [[\u00df]] (''Eszett''), [[IJ (letter)|\u0132]], [[\u00d8]], [[\u00c6]], [[\u00c5]], [[\u00c4]], [[\u00dc]], [[\u00d6]], [[\u00d0]], [[Yogh|\u021c]], and the Latinized runes [[\u00de]] and [[wynn|\u01f7]] (with its Latin counterpart [[W]]).

These probably took place during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] of Northern Europe from c. 500 BC. [[Proto-Germanic]] itself was likely spoken after c. 500 BC,{{sfnp|Ringe|2006|p=67}} and [[Proto-Norse]] from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from [[Proto-Indo-European]] suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the [[Nordic Bronze Age]].\n\nFrom the time of their earliest attestation, the Germanic varieties are divided into three groups:  [[West Germanic languages|West]], [[East Germanic languages|East]], and [[North Germanic languages|North]] Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions.\n\nThe western group would have formed in the late [[Jastorf culture]], and the eastern group may be derived from the 1st-century [[Old Gutnish|variety]] of [[Gotland]], leaving southern Sweden as the original location of the northern group. The earliest period of [[Elder Futhark]] (2nd to 4th centuries) predates the division in regional script variants, and linguistically essentially still reflect the [[Common Germanic]] stage. [[Vimose inscriptions]] AD 160, are the oldest Germanic writing.\n\nThe earliest coherent Germanic text preserved is the 4th-century [[Gothic language|Gothic]] translation of the [[New Testament]] by [[Ulfilas]]. Early testimonies of West Germanic are in [[Old Frankish]]/[[Old Dutch]] (the 5th-century [[Bergakker inscription]]), [[Old High German]] (scattered words and sentences 6th century and coherent texts 9th century), and [[Old English language|Old English]] (oldest texts 650, coherent texts 10th century). North Germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions, as [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], until it evolves into [[Old Norse]] by about 800.\n\nLonger runic inscriptions survive from the 8th and 9th centuries ([[Eggjum stone]], [[R\u00f6k stone]]), longer texts in the Latin alphabet survive from the 12th century ([[\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k]]), and some [[skaldic poetry]] dates back to as early as the 9th century.\n\nBy about the 10th century, the varieties had diverged enough to make [[mutual intelligibility|inter-comprehensibility]] difficult. The linguistic contact of the [[Viking]] settlers of the [[Danelaw]] with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] left traces in the English language and is suspected to have facilitated the collapse of Old English grammar that resulted in [[Middle English]] from the 12th century.\n\nThe East Germanic languages were marginalized from the end of the Migration period. The [[Burgundians]], [[Goths]], and [[Vandals]] became linguistically assimilated by their respective neighbors by about the 7th century, with only [[Crimean Gothic language|Crimean Gothic]] lingering on until the 18th century.\n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, the West Germanic languages were separated by the insular development of Middle English on one hand and by the [[High German consonant shift]] on the continent on the other, resulting in [[Upper German]] and [[Low German|Low Saxon]], with graded intermediate [[Central German]] varieties. By early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]] in the South to [[Northern Low Saxon]] in the North, and, although both extremes are considered German, they are hardly mutually intelligible. The southernmost varieties had completed the second sound shift, while the northern varieties remained unaffected by the consonant shift.\n\nThe North Germanic languages, on the other hand, remained unified until well past 1000 AD, and in fact the mainland Scandinavian languages still largely retain mutual intelligibility into modern times.  The main split in these languages is between the mainland languages and the island languages to the west, especially [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which has maintained the grammar of [[Old Norse]] virtually unchanged, while the mainland languages have diverged greatly.\n\n==Distinctive characteristics==\nGermanic languages possess a number of defining features compared with other Indo-European languages.\n\nProbably the most well-known are the following:\n# The [[sound change]]s known as [[Grimm's Law]] and [[Verner's Law]], which shifted the values of all the Indo-European stop consonants (for example, original *{{IPA|/t d d\u02b0/}} became Germanic *{{IPA|/\u03b8 t d/}} in most cases; compare ''three'' with [[Latin]] {{lang|la|tres}}, ''two'' with Latin {{lang|la|duo}}, ''do'' with [[Sanskrit]] {{transl|sa|dha-}}). The recognition of these two sound laws were seminal events in the understanding of the regular nature of linguistic sound change and the development of the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]], which forms the basis of modern [[historical linguistics]].\n# The development of a strong [[stress (language)|stress]] on the first syllable of the word, which triggered significant phonological reduction of all other syllables. This is responsible for the reduction of most of the basic English, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish words into monosyllables, and the common impression of modern English and German as consonant-heavy languages. Examples are Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*strangi\u00fe\u014d}} \u2192 ''strength'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*aimaitij\u014d}} \u2192 ''ant'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*haubud\u0105}} \u2192 ''head'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hauzijan\u0105}}  \u2192 ''hear'', {{lang|gem-x-proto|*harubistaz}} \u2192 German {{lang|de|Herbst}} \"autumn, harvest\", {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hagatusj\u014d}} \u2192 German {{lang|de|Hexe}} \"witch, hag\".\n# A change known as [[Germanic umlaut]], which modified vowel qualities when a high front vocalic segment ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}) followed in the next syllable.  Generally, back vowels were fronted, and front vowels were raised. In many languages, the modified vowels are indicated with a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (e.g., {{lang|de|\u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc}} in German, pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b \u00f8 y/}}, respectively). This change resulted in pervasive alternations in related words \u2014 still extremely prominent in modern German but present only in remnants in modern English (e.g., ''mouse/mice'', ''goose/geese'', ''broad/breadth'', ''tell/told'', ''old/elder'', ''foul/filth'', ''gold/gild''<ref>These alternations are no longer easily distinguishable from vowel alternations due to earlier changes (e.g. [[Indo-European ablaut]], as in ''write/wrote/written'', ''sing/sang/sung'', ''hold/held'') or later changes (e.g. vowel shortening in [[Middle English]], as in ''wide/width'', ''lead/led'').</ref>).\n# Large numbers of vowel qualities. English is typical in this respect, with around 11\u201312 vowels in most dialects (not counting diphthongs). [[Standard Swedish]] has 17 [[Monophthong|pure vowels (monophthongs)]],{{sfnp|Wang|Ding|Tao|Li|2012|p=657}} standard German and Dutch 14, and [[Danish language|Danish]] at least 11.{{sfnp|Basb\u00f8ll|Jacobsen|2003}} The Amstetten dialect of [[Bavarian German]] has 13 distinctions among long vowels alone, one of the largest such inventories in the world.<ref>{{SOWL|290}}</ref>\n# ''[[V2 word order|Verb second]]'' (V2) word order, which is uncommon cross-linguistically. Exactly one noun phrase or adverbial element must precede the verb; in particular, if an adverb or prepositional phrase precedes the verb, then the subject must immediately follow the finite verb. This is now largely absent in modern English, except in sentences beginning with \"Here is,\" \"There is,\" \"Here comes,\" \"There goes,\" and related expressions, as well as in a few relic sentences such as \"Over went the boat\" or \"[[Pop Goes The Weasel]]\", but is found in all other modern Germanic languages.\n\nOther significant characteristics are:\n# The reduction of the various [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] combinations of the Indo-European verbal system into only two: the [[present tense]] and the [[past tense]] (also called the [[preterite]]).\n# A large class of verbs that use a dental [[suffix]] ({{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}) instead of [[Apophony|vowel alternation]] ([[Indo-European ablaut]]) to indicate past tense. These are called the [[Germanic weak verb]]s; the remaining verbs with vowel ablaut are the [[Germanic strong verb]]s.\n# A distinction in [[definiteness]] of a [[noun phrase]] that is marked by different sets of inflectional endings for [[adjectives]], the so-called strong and weak [[adjective]]s. A similar development happened in the [[Balto-Slavic languages]]. This distinction has been lost in modern English but was present in [[Old English]] and remains in all other Germanic languages to various degrees.\n# Some words with etymologies that are difficult to link to other Indo-European families but with variants that appear in almost all Germanic languages. See [[Germanic substrate hypothesis]].\n\nNote that some of the above characteristics were not present in Proto-Germanic but developed later as [[areal feature]]s that spread from language to language:\n* Germanic umlaut only affected the [[North Germanic languages|North]] and [[West Germanic languages]] (which represent all modern Germanic languages) but not the now-extinct [[East Germanic languages]], such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], nor [[Proto-Germanic]], the common ancestor of all Germanic languages.\n* The large inventory of vowel qualities is a later development, due to a combination of Germanic umlaut and the tendency in many Germanic languages for pairs of long/short vowels of originally identical quality to develop distinct qualities, with the length distinction sometimes eventually lost. Proto-Germanic had only five distinct vowel qualities, although there were more actual vowel phonemes because length and possibly nasality were phonemic. In modern German, long-short vowel pairs still exist but are also distinct in quality.\n* Proto-Germanic probably had a more general S-O-V-I word order. However, the tendency toward V2 order may have already been present in latent form and may be related to [[Wackernagel's Law]], an Indo-European law dictating that sentence [[clitic]]s must be placed second.<ref>According to [[Donald Ringe]], cf. {{Harvcoltxt|Ringe|2006|p=295}}</ref>\n\nRoughly speaking, Germanic languages differ in how conservative or how progressive each language is with respect to an overall trend toward [[analytic language|analyticity]]. Some, such as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and, to a lesser extent, German, have preserved much of the complex [[inflectional morphology]] inherited from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] (and in turn from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]). Others, such as English, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Afrikaans]], have moved toward a largely analytic type.\n\n==Linguistic developments==\n\nThe subgroupings of the Germanic languages are defined by shared innovations.  It is important to distinguish innovations from cases of linguistic conservatism.  That is, if two languages in a family share a characteristic that is not observed in a third language, that is evidence of common ancestry of the two languages ''only if'' the characteristic is an innovation compared to the family's [[proto-language]].\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages (all but [[Gothic language|Gothic]]):\n* The lowering of /u/ to /o/ in initial syllables before /a/ in the following syllable (\"a-Umlaut\", traditionally called ''Brechung'')\n* \"Labial umlaut\" in unstressed medial syllables (the conversion of /a/ to /u/ and /\u014d/ to /\u016b/ before /m/, or /u/ in the following syllable){{sfnp|Campbell|1983|p=139}}\n* The conversion of /\u0113<sub>1</sub>/ into /\u0101/ (vs. Gothic /\u0113/) in stressed syllables.<ref>But see {{Harvcoltxt|Cercignani|1972}}</ref> In unstressed syllables, West Germanic also has this change, but North Germanic has shortened the vowel to /e/, then raised it to /i/. This suggests it was an areal change.\n* The raising of final /\u014d/ to /u/ (Gothic lowers it to /a/). It is kept distinct from the nasal /\u01ed/, which is not raised.\n* The monophthongisation of /ai/ and /au/ to /\u0113/ and /\u014d/ in non-initial syllables (however, evidence for the development of /au/ in medial syllables is lacking).\n* The development of an intensified demonstrative ending in /s/ (reflected in English \"this\" compared to \"the\")\n* Introduction of a distinct ablaut grade in Class VII [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], while Gothic uses [[reduplication]] (e.g. Gothic ''haihait''; ON, OE ''h\u0113t'', preterite of the Gmc verb ''*haitan'' \"to be called\")<ref>See also {{Harvcoltxt|Cercignani|1979}}</ref> as part of a comprehensive reformation of the Gmc Class VII from a reduplicating to a new ablaut pattern, which presumably started in verbs beginning with vowel or /h/{{sfnp|Bethge|1900|p=361}} (a development which continues the general trend of de-reduplication in Gmc{{sfnp|Schumacher|2005|p=603f}}); there are forms (such as OE dial. ''heht'' instead of ''h\u0113t'') which retain traces of reduplication even in West and North Germanic\n\nThe following innovations are also common to the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages but represent [[areal feature|areal changes]]:\n* Proto-Germanic /z/ > /r/ (e.g. Gothic ''dius''; ON ''d\u0233r'', OHG ''tior'', OE ''d\u0113or'', \"wild animal\"); note that this is not present in [[Proto-Norse]] and must be ordered after [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] loss of final /z/\n* [[Germanic umlaut]]\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[West Germanic languages]]:\n* Loss of final /z/. In single-syllable words, Old High German retains it (as /r/), while it disappears in the other West Germanic languages.\n* Change of [\u00f0] (fricative allophone of /d/) to stop [d] in all environments.\n* Change of /l\u00fe/ to stop /ld/ (except word-finally).{{sfnp|Campbell|1983|p=169}}\n* [[West Germanic gemination]] of consonants, except ''r'', before /j/. This only occurred in short-stemmed words due to [[Sievers' law]]. Gemination of /p/, /t/, /k/ and /h/ is also observed before liquids.\n* Labiovelar consonants become plain velar when non-initial.\n* A particular type of ''umlaut'' /e-u-i/ > /i-u-i/.\n* Changes to the 2nd person singular past-tense: Replacement of the past-singular stem vowel with the past-plural stem vowel, and substitution of the ending ''-t'' with ''-\u012b''.\n* Short forms (''*st\u0101n, st\u0113n'', ''*g\u0101n, g\u0113n'') of the verbs for \"stand\" and \"go\"; but note that [[Crimean Gothic]] also has ''g\u0113n''.\n* The development of a [[gerund]].\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Ingvaeonic]] subgroup of the [[West Germanic languages]], which includes English, Frisian, and in a few cases Dutch and Low German, but not High German:\n* The so-called [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]], with loss of /n/ before voiceless fricatives: e.g. ''*mun\u00fe'', ''*gans'' > Old English ''m\u016b\u00fe, g\u014ds'' > \"mouth, goose\", but German ''Mund, Gans''.\n* The loss of the Germanic [[reflexive pronoun]].\n* The reduction of the three Germanic [[verb]]al [[plural]] forms into one form ending in ''-\u00fe''.\n* The development of Class III weak verbs into a relic class consisting of four verbs (''*sagjan'' \"to say\", ''*hugjan'' \"to think\", ''*habjan'' \"to have\", ''*libjan'' \"to live\"; cf. the numerous Old High German verbs in ''-\u0113n'').\n* The split of the Class II weak verb ending ''*-\u014d-'' into ''*-\u014d-/-\u014dja-'' (cf. Old English ''-ian'' < ''-\u014djan'', but Old High German ''-\u014dn'').\n* Development of a plural ending '''*-\u014ds''' in a-stem nouns (note, Gothic also has ''-\u014ds'', but this is an independent development, caused by [[terminal devoicing]] of ''*-\u014dz''; [[Old Frisian]] has ''-ar'', which is thought to be a late borrowing from [[Danish language|Danish]]).  Cf. modern English plural ''-(e)s'', but German plural ''-e''.\n* Possibly, the [[monophthong]]ization of Germanic ''*ai'' to ''\u0113/\u0101'' (this may represent independent changes in Old Saxon and [[Anglo-Frisian]]).\n\nThe following innovations are common to the [[Anglo-Frisian]] subgroup of the [[Ingvaeonic languages]]:\n* Raising of nasalized ''a, \u0101'' into ''o, \u014d''.\n* [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]]: Fronting of non-nasal ''a, \u0101'' to ''\u00e6,\u01e3'' when not followed by ''n'' or ''m''.\n* [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] of ''CrV'' into ''CVr'', where ''C'' represents any consonant and ''V'' any vowel.\n* [[Monophthongization]] of ''ai'' into ''\u0101''.\n\n==Common linguistic features==\n===Phonology===\nThe oldest Germanic languages all share a number of features, which are assumed to be inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]]. Phonologically, it includes the important sound changes known as [[Grimm's Law]] and [[Verner's Law]], which introduced a large number of [[fricative]]s; late [[Proto-Indo-European]] had only one, /s/.\n\nThe main vowel developments are the merging (in most circumstances) of long and short /a/ and /o/, producing short /a/ and long /\u014d/. That likewise affected the [[diphthong]]s, with PIE /ai/ and /oi/ merging into /ai/ and PIE /au/ and /ou/ merging into /au/. PIE /ei/ developed into long /\u012b/. PIE long /\u0113/ developed into a vowel denoted as /\u0113<sub>1</sub>/ (often assumed to be phonetically {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}), while a new, fairly uncommon long vowel /\u0113<sub>2</sub>/ developed in varied and not completely understood circumstances. Proto-Germanic had no [[front rounded vowel]]s, but all Germanic languages except for [[Gothic language|Gothic]] subsequently developed them through the process of [[i-umlaut]].\n\nProto-Germanic developed a strong stress accent on the first syllable of the root, but remnants of the original free PIE accent are visible due to Verner's Law, which was sensitive to this accent. That caused a steady erosion of vowels in unstressed syllables. In Proto-Germanic, that had progressed only to the point that absolutely-final short vowels (other than /i/ and /u/) were lost and absolutely-final long vowels were shortened, but all of the early literary languages show a more advanced state of vowel loss. This ultimately resulted in some languages (like Modern English) losing practically all vowels following the main stress and the consequent rise of a very large number of monosyllabic words.\n\n====Table of outcomes====\nThe following table shows the main outcomes of Proto-Germanic vowels and consonants in the various older languages. For vowels, only the outcomes in stressed syllables are shown. Outcomes in unstressed syllables are quite different, vary from language to language and depend on a number of other factors (such as whether the syllable was medial or final, whether the syllable was [[open syllable|open]] or [[closed syllable|closed]] and (in some cases) whether the preceding syllable was [[light syllable|light]] or [[heavy syllable|heavy]]).\n\nNotes:\n* ''C-'' means before a vowel (word-initially, or sometimes after a consonant).\n* ''-C-'' means between vowels.\n* ''-C'' means after a vowel (word-finally or before a consonant). Word-final outcomes generally occurred ''after'' deletion of final short vowels, which occurred shortly after Proto-Germanic and is reflected in the history of all written languages except for [[Proto-Norse]].\n* The above three are given in the order ''C-'', ''-C-'', ''-C''. If one is omitted, the previous one applies. For example, ''f, -[v]-'' means that ''[v]'' occurs after a vowel regardless of what follows.\n* Something like ''a(\u2026u)'' means \"''a'' if /u/ occurs in the next syllable\".\n* Something like ''a(n)'' means \"''a'' if /n/ immediately follows\".\n* Something like ''(n)a'' means \"''a'' if /n/ immediately precedes\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Development of Germanic sounds\n!

(Pre-)Gothic<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"pre-gothic\">The [[Gothic language#Alphabet and transliteration|Gothic writing system]] uses the spelling {{angbr|ai}} to represent vowels that derive primarily from four different sources:\n# Proto-Germanic /ai/\n# Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} before vowels\n# Proto-Germanic /e/ and /i/ before /h/, /h\u02b7/ and /r/\n# Greek {{IPA|/\u025b/}}.\nThe spelling {{angbr|au}} is similarly used to represent vowels primarily deriving from the following four sources:\n# Proto-Germanic /au/\n# Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} before vowels\n# Proto-Germanic /u/ before /h/, /h\u02b7/ and /r/\n# Greek {{IPA|/\u0254/}}.\nIt is generally agreed that the outcome of case 2 was pronounced {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0/\u0254\u02d0]}} in Gothic, distinct from the vowels written {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|o}}, which were pronounced {{IPA|[e\u02d0/o\u02d0]}}. Likewise, it is generally agreed that the outcomes of cases 3 and 4 were pronounced {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254]}} in Gothic.  However, there is some argument over whether the outcomes of case 1 were still pronounced as diphthongs {{IPA|[ai/au]}}, as in Proto-Germanic, or had merged with case 2 as monophthongs {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0/\u0254\u02d0]}}. There is some historical evidence (particularly from Latin spelling variations of ''Gaut-'' vs. ''G\u014dt-'', used to represent the name of the Goths) that the Proto-Germanic diphthongs had changed into monophthongs shortly before (i.e., within a century of) the time of [[Wulfila]], who designed the Gothic alphabet and wrote the [[Gothic Bible]] c. 360 AD. This accords with the fact that Wulfila used the same symbols {{angbr|ai/au}} to represent all the outcomes, despite the fact that the spellings {{angbr|aj/aw}} were available to unambiguously represent diphthongs (and, in fact, alternate with {{angbr|ai/au}} in a number of nominal and verbal paradigms). The use of the spelling {{angbr|ai}} to represent a monophthong {{IPA|[\u025b(\u02d0)]}} was evidently in imitation of 4th century Greek, where {{angbr|ai}} likewise stood for {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, and {{angbr|au}} was apparently created by analogy. Consistent with many sources, such as {{Harvcoltxt|Bennett|1980}}, the phonology described here is that of \"Pre-Gothic\" (i.e., the phonology of Gothic just before the monophthongization of /ai/ and /au/).</ref>{{sfnp|Bennett|1980}}{{sfnp|Wright|1919}} !!

Some vowels were affected similarly, but only by a following /w/; this process is sometimes termed ''w-umlaut''. These processes operated after [[i-umlaut]].  ''U-umlaut'' (by a following /u/ or /w/) caused /a/, /ja/ (broken /e/), /a\u02d0/, and /e/ to round to /\u0254/ (written ''o\u0327''), /j\u0254/ (written ''jo\u0327''), /\u0254\u02d0/ (written ''\u00f3\u0327'' and later unrounded again to /a\u02d0/), and /\u00f8/, respectively.  The vowels /i/ and /ai/ rounded to /y/ and /ey/, respectively, only before /w/.  Short /a/ become /\u00f8/ by a combination of i-umlaut and w-umlaut.</ref> || \u00e6, a(\u2026a),<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\">A process known as [[a-mutation]] or ''a-umlaut'' caused short /u/ to lower to /o/ before a non-high vowel (usually /a/) in the following syllable.  All languages except Gothic were affected, although there are various exceptions in all the languages.  Two similar process later operated:\n* In Old High German, /iu/ (from Proto-Germanic /eu/,/iu/) became /io/ before a non-high vowel in the next syllable.\n* In Old English, /\u00e6/ (from Proto-Germanic /a/) became /a/ before /a/ in the next syllable.\nAll of these processes were blocked in an i-umlaut context (i.e. by a following /j/).</ref> a/o(n), \u00e6\u0306\u0103(h,rC,lC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\">The diphthongal results are due to [[Old English breaking]].  In general, front vowels break into diphthongs before some subset of ''h'', ''w'', ''rC'', and ''lC'', where ''C'' is a consonant.  The diphthong /\u00e6a/ is written ''ea''; /eo/ is written ''eo''; /iu/ is written ''io''; and /iy/ is written ''ie''. All diphthongs umlaut to /iy/ ''ie''. All diphthongs occur both long and short. Note that there is significant dispute about the actual pronunciation of ''io'' and (especially) ''ie''. Their interpretation as /iu/ and /iy/, respectively, follows Lass (1994), ''Old English: A historical linguistic companion''.</ref> || a\n|-\n! a(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\">All languages except Gothic were affected by [[i-umlaut]].  This was the most significant of the various [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] processes operating in the Germanic languages, and caused back vowels to become fronted, and front vowels to be raised, when /i/, /i\u02d0/ or /j/ followed in the next syllable.  The term ''i-umlaut'' actually refers to two separate processes that both were triggered in the same environment.  The earlier process raised /e/ and /eu/ to /i/ and /iu/, respectively, and may have operated still in Proto-Germanic (with its effects in Gothic obscured due to later changes).  The later process affected all back vowels and some front vowels; it operated independently in the various languages, occurring at differing times with differing results.  Old English was the earliest and most-affected language, with nearly all vowels affected.  Old High German was the last language to be affected; the only written evidence of the process is with short /a/, which is umlauted to /e/.  However, later evidence suggests that other back vowels were also affected, perhaps still sub-phonemically in Old High German times.  These are indicated with a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] or \"umlaut\" symbol (two dots) placed over the affected vowels.</ref>\n| e, \u00f8(\u2026u)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || e, \u00e6, \u012dy\u0306(h,rC,lC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || e, a(hs,ht,Cw)\n|-\n! \u00e3\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | a\u02d0  || a\u02d0 || o\u02d0 || a\u02d0\n|-\n! \u00e3\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| \u00e6\u02d0 || e\u02d0 || \u00e4\u02d0\n|-\n! \u00e6\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | e\u02d0, \u025b\u02d0(V) || a\u02d0 || \u00e6\u02d0, \u00e6a(h)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || a\u02d0\n|-\n! \u00e6\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| \u00e6\u02d0 || \u00e6\u02d0 || \u00e4\u02d0\n|-\n! e\n| rowspan=2 | i, \u025b(h,h\u02b7,r) || ja,<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-breaking\">Proto-Germanic /e/ usually became Old Norse /ja/ by a process known as [[vowel breaking]].</ref> j\u00f8(\u2026u),<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> (w,r,l)e, (w,r,l)\u00f8(\u2026u)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || e, \u0115\u014f(h,w,rC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || e, i(\u2026u)\n|-\n! e(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| i, y(\u2026w)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || i || i\n|-\n! e\u02d0\n| e\u02d0, \u025b\u02d0(V) || e\u02d0 || e\u02d0 || {{not a typo|ie}}\n|-\n! i\n| i, \u025b(h,h\u02b7,r) || i, y(\u2026w)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> || i, \u012d\u016d(h,w,rC)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"oe-breaking\" /> || i\n|-\n! i\u02d0\n| i\u02d0 || i\u02d0 || i\u02d0, iu(h) || i\u02d0\n|-\n! o\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | o\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0(V) || o\u02d0 || o\u02d0 || uo\n|-\n! o\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| \u00f8\u02d0 || e\u02d0 || \u00fc\u00f6\n|-\n! u\n| rowspan=2 | u, \u0254(h,h\u02b7,r) || u, o(\u2026a)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\" /> || u, o(\u2026a)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\" /> || u, o(\u2026a)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"a-umlaut\" />\n|-\n! u(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| y || y || \u00fc\n|-\n! u\u02d0\n| rowspan=2 | u\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0(V) || u\u02d0 || u\u02d0 || u\u02d0\n|-\n! u\u02d0(\u2026i)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"i-umlaut\" />\n| y\u02d0 || y\u02d0 || \u00fc\u02d0\n|-\n! ai\n| rowspan=2 | ai<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"pre-gothic\" /> || ei, ey(\u2026w),<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-u-umlaut\" /> a\u02d0(h,r)<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"norse-ai\">Before Proto-Germanic /x/, /x\u02b7/ or /r/, but not before Proto-Germanic /z/ (which only merged with /r/ much later in North Germanic).

The loss of /j/ after a consonant occurred in the various languages at different times and to differing degrees.  For example, /j/ was still present in most circumstances in written Old Saxon, and was still present in Old Norse when a short vowel preceded and a back vowel followed; but in Old English and Old High German, /j/ only remained after an /r/ preceded by a short vowel.</ref>\n| j || \u2205-, -j-, -\u2205 || j || j\n|-\n! w<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"jw\" />\n| w || \u2205-, v-(a,e,i), -v-, -\u2205 || w || w\n|}\n\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n===Morphology===\nThe oldest Germanic languages have the typical complex inflected morphology of old [[Indo-European language]]s, with four or five noun cases; verbs marked for person, number, tense and mood; multiple noun and verb classes; few or no articles; and rather free word order.  The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing.  There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE [[optative mood]]) and imperative.  Gothic verbs had a number of archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE [[mediopassive voice]]), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect).  The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. ''In three months, the house will still be being built'' or ''If you had not acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught'') is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).\n\nAmong the primary innovations in Proto-Germanic are the [[preterite present verb]]s, a special set of verbs whose present tense looks like the past tense of other verbs and which is the origin of most [[modal verb]]s in English; a past-tense ending (in the so-called \"weak verbs\", marked with ''-ed'' in English) that appears variously as /d/ or /t/, often assumed to be derived from the verb \"to do\"; and two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (\"a man\", with a combination of PIE adjective and pronoun endings) and definite semantics (\"the man\", with endings derived from PIE ''n''-stem nouns).\n\nNote that most modern Germanic languages have lost most of the inherited inflectional morphology as a result of the steady attrition of unstressed endings triggered by the strong initial stress. (Contrast, for example, the [[Balto-Slavic languages]], which have largely kept the Indo-European [[pitch accent]] and consequently preserved much of the inherited morphology.) [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to a lesser extent modern German best preserve the Proto\u2013Germanic inflectional system, with four noun cases, three genders, and well-marked verbs. English and Afrikaans are at the other extreme, with almost no remaining inflectional morphology.\n\nThe following shows a typical masculine ''a''-stem noun, Proto-Germanic ''*fiskaz'' (\"fish\"), and its development in the various old literary languages:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Declension of ''a''-stem noun ''*fiskaz'' \"fish\" in various languages{{sfnp|Ringe|2006}}{{sfnp|Lass|1994}}{{sfnp|Helfenstein|1870}}\n! colspan=2 | !!

The most common class (the ''o/\u0101'' class) used a combination of ''o''-stem endings for masculine and neuter genders and ''\u0101''-stems ending for feminine genders, but other common classes (e.g. the ''i'' class and ''u'' class) used endings from a single vowel-stem declension for all genders, and various other classes existed that were based on other declensions. A quite different set of \"pronominal\" endings was used for pronouns, [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]], and words with related semantics (e.g., \"all\", \"only\").\n\nAn important innovation in Proto-Germanic was the development of two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (\"a man\") and definite semantics (\"the man\"). The endings of indefinite adjectives were derived from a combination of pronominal endings with one of the common vowel-stem adjective declensions \u2013 usually the ''o/\u0101'' class (often termed the ''a/\u014d'' class in the specific context of the Germanic languages) but sometimes the ''i'' or ''u'' classes. Definite adjectives, however, had endings based on ''n''-stem nouns.  Originally both types of adjectives could be used by themselves, but already by Proto-Germanic times a pattern evolved whereby definite adjectives had to be accompanied by a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] with definite semantics (e.g., a [[definite article]], [[demonstrative pronoun]], [[possessive pronoun]], or the like), while indefinite adjectives were used in other circumstances (either accompanied by a word with indefinite semantics such as \"a\", \"one\", or \"some\" or unaccompanied).\n\nIn the 19th century, the two types of adjectives \u2013 indefinite and definite \u2013 were respectively termed \"strong\" and \"weak\", names which are still commonly used. These names were based on the appearance of the two sets of endings in modern German. In German, the distinctive case endings formerly present on nouns have largely disappeared, with the result that the load of distinguishing one case from another is almost entirely carried by determiners and adjectives. Furthermore, due to regular sound change, the various definite (''n''-stem) adjective endings coalesced to the point where only two endings (''-e'' and ''-en'') remain in modern German to express the sixteen possible inflectional categories of the language (masculine/feminine/neuter/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive \u2013 modern German merges all genders in the plural). The indefinite (''a/\u014d''-stem) adjective endings were less affected by sound change, with six endings remaining (''-, -e, -es, -er, -em, -en''), cleverly distributed in a way that is capable of expressing the various inflectional categories without too much ambiguity. As a result, the definite endings were thought of as too \"weak\" to carry inflectional meaning and in need of \"strengthening\" by the presence of an accompanying determiner, while the indefinite endings were viewed as \"strong\" enough to indicate the inflectional categories even when standing alone. (This view is enhanced by the fact that modern German largely uses weak-ending adjectives when accompanying an indefinite article, and hence the indefinite/definite distinction no longer clearly applies.) By analogy, the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" were extended to the corresponding noun classes, with ''a''-stem and ''\u014d''-stem nouns termed \"strong\" and ''n''-stem nouns termed \"weak\".\n\nHowever, in Proto-Germanic \u2013 and still in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], the most conservative Germanic language \u2013 the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" are not clearly appropriate. For one thing, there were a large number of noun declensions. The ''a''-stem, ''\u014d''-stem, and ''n''-stem declensions were the most common and represented targets into which the other declensions were eventually absorbed, but this process occurred only gradually. Originally the ''n''-stem declension was not a single declension but a set of separate declensions (e.g., ''-an'', ''-\u014dn'', ''-\u012bn'') with related endings, and these endings were in no way any \"weaker\" than the endings of any other declensions. (For example, among the eight possible inflectional categories of a noun \u2014 singular/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive \u2014 masculine ''an''-stem nouns in Gothic include seven endings, and feminine ''\u014dn''-stem nouns include six endings, meaning there is very little ambiguity of \"weakness\" in these endings and in fact much less than in the German \"strong\" endings.) Although it is possible to group the various noun declensions into three basic categories \u2014 vowel-stem, ''n''-stem, and other-consonant-stem (a.k.a. \"minor declensions\") \u2014 the vowel-stem nouns do not display any sort of unity in their endings that supports grouping them together with each other but separate from the ''n''-stem endings.\n\nIt is only in later languages that the binary distinction between \"strong\" and \"weak\" nouns become more relevant. In [[Old English]], the ''n''-stem nouns form a single, clear class, but the masculine ''a''-stem and feminine ''\u014d''-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and neither has much similarity to the small class of ''u''-stem nouns. Similarly, in [[Old Norse]], the masculine ''a''-stem and feminine ''\u014d''-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and the continuations of the masculine ''an''-stem and feminine ''\u014dn/\u012bn''-stem nouns are also quite distinct. It is only in [[Middle Dutch]] and modern German that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged to the point that a binary strong/weak distinction clearly applies.\n\nAs a result, newer grammatical descriptions of the Germanic languages often avoid the terms \"strong\" and \"weak\" except in conjunction with German itself, preferring instead to use the terms \"indefinite\" and \"definite\" for adjectives and to distinguish nouns by their actual stem class.\n\nIn English, both two sets of adjective endings were lost entirely in the late [[Middle English]] period.\n\n==Classification==<!-- This section is linked from [[American and British English differences]] -->\nNote that divisions between and among subfamilies of Germanic are rarely precisely defined; most form continuous clines, with adjacent [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not.  Within the Germanic language family is [[East Germanic]], [[West Germanic]], and [[North Germanic]].  However, East Germanic languages became extinct several centuries ago.\n\n===Diachronic===\n\nThe table below shows the succession of the significant historical stages of each [[language]] (horizontally) and their approximate groupings in [[subfamilies]] (vertically). Vertical sequence within each group does not imply a measure of greater or lesser similarity.\n\n{{Germanic diachronic}}\n\n===Contemporary===\n{{main|List of Germanic languages}}\n[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Germanic languages and main dialect groups]]\nAll living Germanic languages belong either to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] or to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] branch.\nThe West Germanic group is the larger by far, further subdivided into [[Anglo-Frisian]] on one hand and [[Continental West Germanic]] on the other. Anglo-Frisian notably includes English and all its [[English language|variants]], while Continental West Germanic includes German ([[Standard German|standard register]] and [[German dialects|dialects]]), as well as Dutch ([[Standard Dutch|standard register]] and [[Dutch dialects|dialects]]).\n\nModern classification looks like this.

Early runic inscriptions also are largely limited to personal names and difficult to interpret. The [[Gothic language]] was written in the [[Gothic alphabet]] developed by Bishop [[Ulfilas]] for his translation of the [[Bible]] in the 4th century.<ref>[[Fausto Cercignani|Cercignani, Fausto]], ''The Elaboration of the Gothic Alphabet and Orthography'', in \"Indogermanische Forschungen\", 93, 1988, pp. 168\u2013185.</ref> Later, [[Christianity|Christian]] priests and monks who spoke and read [[Latin]] in addition to their native Germanic varieties began writing the Germanic languages with slightly modified Latin letters. However, throughout the [[Viking Age]], runic alphabets remained in common use in Scandinavia.\n\nIn addition to the standard [[Latin script]], many Germanic languages use a variety of [[diacritic|accent marks]] and extra letters, including the [[\u00df]] (''Eszett''), [[IJ (letter)|\u0132]], [[\u00d8]], [[\u00c6]], [[\u00c5]], [[\u00c4]], [[\u00dc]], [[\u00d6]], [[\u00d0]], [[Yogh|\u021c]], and the Latinized runes [[\u00de]] and [[wynn|\u01f7]] (with its Latin counterpart [[W]]). In print, German used to be prevalently set in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (e.g., [[fraktur (typeface)|fraktur]] or [[schwabacher]]) [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|until]] the 1940s, when ''[[Kurrent]]'' and, since the early 20th century, ''[[S\u00fctterlin]]'' were used for German handwriting.\n\nYiddish is written using an adapted [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n==Vocabulary comparison==<!-- This section is linked from [[Gothic language]] -->\nSeveral of the terms in the table below have had [[semantic drift]]. For example, the form ''Sterben'' and other terms for ''die'' are [[cognates]] with the English word ''starve''. There is also at least three examples of a common borrowing from a non-Germanic source (''ounce'' and ''devil'' and their cognates from [[Latin]], ''church'' and its cognates from [[Greek language|Greek]]).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n!

However, the Danish form remained in use alongside the Norwegian form and was reintroduced as an alternative spelling in 2005. This form is therefore linked to a more conservative and/or formal style of writing and is more likely to be used by writers who retain other Danish forms (e.g. hverken, tyve, tredve and efter)</ref> || sju \n|-\n| shoe || shae || skoech || skoen || schoen || sjoon || Schoh || Schong || Schuh || \u05e9\u05d5\u05da<br />(shukh) || \ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3a\ud800\udf49\ud800\udf37\ud800\udf43<br />(sk\u014dhs) || sk\u00f3r || sk\u00f3gvur || sko || sko || sko || sko\n|-\n| snow || snaw || snie || sneeu || sneeuw || sjnie || Snee || Schn\u00e9i || Schnee || \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9<br />(shney) || \ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf45\ud800\udf43<br />(sn\u00e1iws) || snj\u00f3r || kavi, snj\u00f3gvur || sn\u00f6 || sne || sn\u00f8 || sn\u00f8\n|-\n!
