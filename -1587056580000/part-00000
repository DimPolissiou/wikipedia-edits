He only recognised five species in ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753), ''[[Lavandula multifida|L. multifida]]'' and ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]'' (Spain) and ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]'' and ''L. spica'' from Southern Europe. ''[[Lavandula pedunculata|L. pedunculata]]'' was included within ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]].''\n\nBy 1790, ''[[Lavandula pinnata|L. pinnata]]'' and ''L. carnosa'' were recognised. The latter was subsequently transferred to ''[[Anisochilus]]''. By 1826 [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz]] listed 12 species in three sections, and by 1848 eighteen species were known.<ref name=Lis/>\n\nOne of the first modern major classifications was that of [[Dorothy Chaytor]] in 1937 at Kew. The six sections she proposed for 28 species still left many intermediates that could not easily be assigned. Her sections included ''[[Stoechas]]'', ''[[Spica]]'', ''[[Subnudae]]'', ''[[Pterostoechas]]'', ''[[Chaetostachys]]'' and ''[[Dentatae]]''. However all the major cultivated and commercial forms resided in the ''[[Stoechas]]'' and ''[[Spica]]'' sections. There were four species within ''Stoechas'' (''[[Lavandula stoechas]]'', ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]], [[Lavandula viridis|L. viridis]]'' and ''[[Lavandula pedunculata|L. pedunculata]]'') while ''Spica'' had three (''L. officinalis'' (now ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]''), ''[[Lavandula latifolia|L. latifolia]]'' and ''[[Lavandula lanata|L. lanata]]''). She believed that the garden varieties were [[Hybrid (biology)#Hybrid plants|hybrids]] between true lavender ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]'' and spike lavender (''[[Lavandula latifolia|L. latifolia]]'').\n<ref>Chaytor D A. A taxonomic study of the genus Lavandula. 1937</ref>\n\n''Lavandula'' has three subgenera:{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n*Subgenus ''Lavandula'' is mainly of woody shrubs with entire leaves. It contains the principal species grown as ornamental plants and for oils. They are found across the Mediterranean region to northeast Africa and western Arabia.\n*Subgenus ''Fabricia'' consists of shrubs and herbs, and it has a wide distribution from the Atlantic to India. It contains some ornamental plants.\n*Subgenus ''Sabaudia'' constitutes two species in the southwest Arabian peninsula and Eritrea, which are rather distinct from the other species, and are sometimes placed in their own genus ''Sabaudia''.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous hybrids and cultivars in commercial and horticultural usage.<ref name=upsonandrews/>\n\nThe first major [[clade]] corresponds to subgenus ''Lavendula'', and the second Fabricia. The ''Sabaudia'' group is less clearly defined. Within the lavendula clade, the subclades correspond to the existing sections, but place ''[[Dentatae]]'' separately from ''[[Stoechas]]'', not within it. Within the Fabricia clade, the subclades correspond to ''[[Pterostoechas]]'', ''[[Subnudae]]'', and ''[[Chaetostachys]]''.\n\nThus the current classification includes 39 species distributed across 8 sections (the original 6 of Chaytor and the two new sections of Upson and Andrews), in three subgenera (see table below). However, since lavender [[crosspollination|cross-pollinates]] easily, there are countless variations that present difficulties in classification.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word lavender is generally thought to be derived from Old French ''lavandre'', ultimately from the Latin ''lavare'' (to wash), referring to the use of infusions of the plants.<ref>Concise Oxford Dictionary</ref> The botanic name ''Lavandula'' as used by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] is considered to be derived from this and other European vernacular names for the plants. However it is suggested that this explanation may be apocryphal, and that the name may actually be derived from Latin ''livere'', \"blueish\".<ref>The alternative derivation of the name lavender from Latin ''livere'' and medieval Latin ''lavindula'' is given in Upson and Andrews, where it is presented as a conjecture. The problems with the standard derivation are also described; such as that there is no knowledge of the common use of lavender for washing by Greeks and Romans.</ref>\n\nThe names widely used for some of the species, \"English lavender\", \"French lavender\" and \"Spanish lavender\" are all imprecisely applied. \"English lavender\" is commonly used for ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]'', though some references say the proper term is \"Old English Lavender\".<ref>Hillier</ref> The name \"French lavender\" may be used to refer to either ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]'' or to ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]''. \"Spanish lavender\" may be used to refer to ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]'', ''[[Lavandula lanata|L. lanata]]'' or ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]''.\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Bee pollen lavender.JPG|thumb|right|A [[honey bee]] on a lavender flower]]\nThe most common form in cultivation is the common or English lavender ''[[Lavandula angustifolia]]'' (formerly named ''L. officinalis''). A wide range of [[cultivar]]s can be found. Other commonly grown ornamental species are [[Lavandula stoechas|''L. stoechas'']], ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]'', and ''[[Lavandula multifida|L. multifida]]'' (Egyptian lavender).\n\nBecause the cultivated forms are planted in gardens worldwide, they are occasionally found growing wild as garden escapes, well beyond their natural range. Such spontaneous growth is usually harmless, but in some cases ''Lavandula'' species have become [[Invasive species|invasive]]. For example, in Australia, ''[[Lavandula stoechas]]'' has become a cause for concern; it occurs widely throughout the continent, and has been declared a noxious weed in Victoria since 1920.<ref>Carr, G.W, Yugovic, J.V and Robinson, K.E..

''Lavandula ''\u00d7'' intermedia'', also known as '''lavandin''' or '''Dutch lavender''', yields a similar essential oil, but with higher levels of [[terpene]]s including [[camphor]], which add a sharper overtone to the fragrance.\n\nThe lavandins ''Lavandula ''\u00d7'' intermedia'' are a class of hybrids of ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]'' and ''[[Lavandula latifolia|L. latifolia]]''.<ref>Mark Griffiths, ''Index of Garden Plants'' (Portland, Oregon: Timber Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-333-59149-6}}.)</ref> The lavandins are widely cultivated for commercial use, since their flowers tend to be bigger than those of English lavender and the plants tend to be easier to harvest, but lavandin oil is regarded by some to be of a lower quality than that of English lavender, with a perfume less sweet.<ref>[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

Lavender can be used in breads where recipes call for rosemary. Lavender can be used decoratively in dishes or spirits, or as a decorative and aromatic in a glass of champagne.

He only recognised five species in ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753), ''[[Lavandula multifida|L. multifida]]'' and ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]'' (Spain) and ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]'' and ''L. spica'' from Southern Europe. ''[[Lavandula pedunculata|L. pedunculata]]'' was included within ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]].''\n\nBy 1790, ''[[Lavandula pinnata|L. pinnata]]'' and ''L. carnosa'' were recognised. The latter was subsequently transferred to ''[[Anisochilus]]''. By 1826 [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz]] listed 12 species in three sections, and by 1848 eighteen species were known.<ref name=Lis/>\n\nOne of the first modern major classifications was that of [[Dorothy Chaytor]] in 1937 at Kew. The six sections she proposed for 28 species still left many intermediates that could not easily be assigned. Her sections included ''[[Stoechas]]'', ''[[Spica]]'', ''[[Subnudae]]'', ''[[Pterostoechas]]'', ''[[Chaetostachys]]'' and ''[[Dentatae]]''. However all the major cultivated and commercial forms resided in the ''[[Stoechas]]'' and ''[[Spica]]'' sections. There were four species within ''Stoechas'' (''[[Lavandula stoechas]]'', ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]], [[Lavandula viridis|L. viridis]]'' and ''[[Lavandula pedunculata|L. pedunculata]]'') while ''Spica'' had three (''L. officinalis'' (now ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]''), ''[[Lavandula latifolia|L. latifolia]]'' and ''[[Lavandula lanata|L. lanata]]''). She believed that the garden varieties were [[Hybrid (biology)#Hybrid plants|hybrids]] between true lavender ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]'' and spike lavender (''[[Lavandula latifolia|L. latifolia]]'').\n<ref>Chaytor D A. A taxonomic study of the genus Lavandula. 1937</ref>\n\n''Lavandula'' has three subgenera:{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n*Subgenus ''Lavandula'' is mainly of woody shrubs with entire leaves. It contains the principal species grown as ornamental plants and for oils. They are found across the Mediterranean region to northeast Africa and western Arabia.\n*Subgenus ''Fabricia'' consists of shrubs and herbs, and it has a wide distribution from the Atlantic to India. It contains some ornamental plants.\n*Subgenus ''Sabaudia'' constitutes two species in the southwest Arabian peninsula and Eritrea, which are rather distinct from the other species, and are sometimes placed in their own genus ''Sabaudia''.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous hybrids and cultivars in commercial and horticultural usage.<ref name=upsonandrews/>\n\nThe first major [[clade]] corresponds to subgenus ''Lavendula'', and the second Fabricia. The ''Sabaudia'' group is less clearly defined. Within the lavendula clade, the subclades correspond to the existing sections, but place ''[[Dentatae]]'' separately from ''[[Stoechas]]'', not within it. Within the Fabricia clade, the subclades correspond to ''[[Pterostoechas]]'', ''[[Subnudae]]'', and ''[[Chaetostachys]]''.\n\nThus the current classification includes 39 species distributed across 8 sections (the original 6 of Chaytor and the two new sections of Upson and Andrews), in three subgenera (see table below). However, since lavender [[crosspollination|cross-pollinates]] easily, there are countless variations that present difficulties in classification.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word lavender is generally thought to be derived from Old French ''lavandre'', ultimately from the Latin ''lavare'' (to wash), referring to the use of infusions of the plants.<ref>Concise Oxford Dictionary</ref> The botanic name ''Lavandula'' as used by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] is considered to be derived from this and other European vernacular names for the plants. However it is suggested that this explanation may be apocryphal, and that the name may actually be derived from Latin ''livere'', \"blueish\".<ref>The alternative derivation of the name lavender from Latin ''livere'' and medieval Latin ''lavindula'' is given in Upson and Andrews, where it is presented as a conjecture. The problems with the standard derivation are also described; such as that there is no knowledge of the common use of lavender for washing by Greeks and Romans.</ref>\n\nThe names widely used for some of the species, \"English lavender\", \"French lavender\" and \"Spanish lavender\" are all imprecisely applied. \"English lavender\" is commonly used for ''[[Lavandula angustifolia|L. angustifolia]]'', though some references say the proper term is \"Old English Lavender\".<ref>Hillier</ref> The name \"French lavender\" may be used to refer to either ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]'' or to ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]''. \"Spanish lavender\" may be used to refer to ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]'', ''[[Lavandula lanata|L. lanata]]'' or ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]''.\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Bee pollen lavender.JPG|thumb|right|A [[honey bee]] on a lavender flower]]\nThe most common form in cultivation is the common or English lavender ''[[Lavandula angustifolia]]'' (formerly named ''L. officinalis''). A wide range of [[cultivar]]s can be found. Other commonly grown ornamental species are [[Lavandula stoechas|''L. stoechas'']], ''[[Lavandula dentata|L. dentata]]'', and ''[[Lavandula multifida|L. multifida]]'' (Egyptian lavender).\n\nBecause the cultivated forms are planted in gardens worldwide, they are occasionally found growing wild as garden escapes, well beyond their natural range. Such spontaneous growth is usually harmless, but in some cases ''Lavandula'' species have become [[Invasive species|invasive]]. For example, in Australia, ''[[Lavandula stoechas]]'' has become a cause for concern; it occurs widely throughout the continent, and has been declared a noxious weed in Victoria since 1920.<ref>Carr, G.W, Yugovic, J.V and Robinson, K.E..

Lavender greens have a more subtle flavour when compared to [[rosemary]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cooking with Lavender?|url=https://www.chowhound.com/post/cooking-lavender-631173|website=Chowhound|accessdate=16 February 2017|language=en|date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe potency of the lavender flowers increases with drying which necessitates more sparing use to avoid a heavy, soapy aftertaste. Chefs note to reduce by two-thirds the dry amount in recipes which call for fresh lavender buds.<ref name=\"Lavender\"/><ref>\"[http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/cooking-with-lavender Cooking With Lavender]\", ''Bon Appetit'', March 27, 2015</ref>\n\nLavender buds can amplify both sweet and savory flavors in dishes, and are sometimes paired with sheep's-milk and goat's-milk cheeses. Lavender flowers are occasionally blended with [[black tea|black]], [[green tea|green]], or [[herbal tea]]s. Lavender flavours baked goods and desserts, pairing especially well with chocolate. In the United States, both lavender syrup and dried lavender buds are used to make lavender [[scone (bread)|scone]]s and [[marshmallow]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stradley|first1=Linda|title=Lavender Scones, Whats Cooking America|url=https://whatscookingamerica.net/EllenEaston/LavenderScones.htm|website=What's Cooking America|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Maclain|first1=Ben|title=Lavender Marshmallows - Havoc In The Kitchen|url=http://www.havocinthekitchen.com/lavender-marshmallows/|website=Havoc In The Kitchen|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nLavender buds are put into sugar for two weeks to allow the essential oils and fragrance to transfer; then the sugar itself is used in baking. Lavender can be used in breads where recipes call for rosemary. Lavender can be used decoratively in dishes or spirits, or as a decorative and aromatic in a glass of champagne. Lavender is used in savory dishes, giving stews and reduced sauces aromatic flair. It is also used to scent flans, custards, and sorbets.<ref name=\"Lavender\"/>\n\n===Use of greens===\n\nThe greens are used similarly to rosemary or combined with rosemary to flavour meat and vegetables in savory dishes. They can also be used to make a tea that is milder than teas made with the flowers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lavender: 12 Uses Beyond Potpourri|url=https://livingonagreenthumb.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/lavender-12-uses-beyond-potpourri/|website=living on a green thumb|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===In honey===\n\nThe flowers yield abundant [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], from which bees make a high-quality [[honey]].

offered by [[NHK World-Japan]], the international arm of [[Japan]]'s public broadcaster [[NHK]]. The service is aimed towards overseas Japanese and the overseas market, similar to worldwide national channels such as [[CCTV-4]], [[KBS World]], [[TV5Monde]], [[TVE Internacional]], [[RTP Internacional]], [[Rai Italia]] or [[RTR Planeta]], and broadcast through subscription TV providers around the world.\n\nThe purpose of NHK World Premium is to make original, general television content produced by NHK available to an international audience. It provides a mixture of news, sports and entertainment shows in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] language, all of which are [[simulcast]] or previously shown on NHK's domestic TV networks in Japan ([[NHK General TV|NHK G]], [[NHK Educational TV|NHK E]], [[NHK BS1]] and [[NHK BS Premium]]).\n\nThe service is marketed as a pay satellite or cable TV channel with that name except for Europe and North America. In Europe, the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], the service is broadcast under the [[Brand|brand name]] '''[[JSTV]]''', and in the US and Canada it is known as [[TV Japan|'''TV Japan''']]. Unlike the regular NHK World Premium service, both JSTV and TV Japan offer some additional programming from other major Japanese TV broadcasters such as [[TV Tokyo]] or [[Fuji TV]], in addition to NHK's own shows. Contents generally do not carry English subtitles or dubbing, while a few of them, especially news, have bilingual audio (a feature kept from their original, domestic broadcast in Japan, where it is offered as well).\n\n== Programmes ==\n*'' [[Food]] '' (carry Fod listed as [[BBC Japan]]) \n* ''[[AKB48 Show!]]''\n* ''Everyday Tips''\n* ''Fudoki''\n* ''Fun with English''\n* ''Go Focus''\n* ''Good Morning, Japan''\n* ''International News Report'' \n* ''Mini Program''\n* ''Morning Market''\n* ''News'' (carry news from [[NHK General TV]])\n* ''News & Weather'' (from NHK General TV)\n* ''[[News Watch 9]]'' (listed as NHK News 9)\n* ''NHK News'' (carry news from NHK BS 1 which usually airs at 50 minutes past the hour)\n* ''[[NHK News 7]]''\n* ''NHK Premap'' (program highlights)\n* ''[[Nippon

[[broadcasting]] service offered by [[NHK World-Japan]], the international arm of [[Japan]]'s public broadcaster [[NHK]]. The service is aimed towards overseas Japanese and the overseas market, similar to worldwide national channels such as [[CCTV-4]], [[KBS World]], [[TV5Monde]], [[TVE Internacional]], [[RTP Internacional]], [[Rai Italia]] or [[RTR Planeta]], and broadcast through subscription TV providers around the world.\n\nThe purpose of NHK World Premium is to make original, general television content produced by NHK available to an international audience. It provides a mixture of news, sports and entertainment shows in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] language, all of which are [[simulcast]] or previously shown on NHK's domestic TV networks in Japan ([[NHK General TV|NHK G]], [[NHK Educational TV|NHK E]], [[NHK BS1]] and [[NHK BS Premium]]).\n\nThe service is marketed as a pay satellite or cable TV channel with that name except for Europe and North America. In Europe, the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], the service is broadcast under the [[Brand|brand name]] '''[[JSTV]]''', and in the US and Canada it is known as [[TV Japan|'''TV Japan''']]. Unlike the regular NHK World Premium service, both JSTV and TV Japan offer some additional programming from other major Japanese TV broadcasters such as [[TV Tokyo]] or [[Fuji TV]], in addition to NHK's own shows. Contents generally do not carry English subtitles or dubbing, while a few of them, especially news, have bilingual audio (a feature kept from their original, domestic broadcast in Japan, where it is offered as well).\n\n== Programmes ==\n*'' [[Food]] '' (carry Fod listed as [[BBC Japan]]) \n* ''[[AKB48 Show!]]''\n* ''Everyday Tips''\n* ''Fudoki''\n* ''Fun with English''\n* ''Go Focus''\n* ''Good Morning, Japan''\n* ''International News Report'' \n* ''Mini Program''\n* ''Morning Market''\n* ''News'' (carry news from [[NHK General TV]])\n* ''News & Weather'' (from NHK General TV)\n* ''[[News Watch 9]]'' (listed as NHK News 9)\n* ''NHK News'' (carry news from NHK BS 1 which usually airs at 50 minutes past the hour)\n* ''[[NHK News 7]]''\n* ''NHK Premap'' (program highlights)\n* ''[[Nippon Professional Baseball]]''\n* ''[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]''\n* ''Science for Everyone''\n*[[Shounen Club]]\n* ''Sports Plus''\n* ''[[Utacon]]''\n* ''[[Okaasan to Issho|With Mother]]''\n* ''World Weather''\n\n== Internet service ==\nNHK World Premium programs and contents are available online.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[NHK]]\n* [[NHK World]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* https://nhkworldpremium.com/faq/\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|nhkworldpremium.com/}}\n\n[[Category:24-hour television news channels in Japan]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations]]\n[[Category:Cable television in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2006]]\n", "name_user": "TheGreatSG'rean", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHK_World_Premium"}
