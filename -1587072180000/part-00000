However, the first documented evidence of its existence dates from 1294 when it was described as the pasturage of the Manor of Ewloe, spelled as \"Bokkeley\".<ref name=buckleysociety/>\n\nThe name Buckley may derive from the [[Old English]] ''bok lee'', meaning meadow, or field.<ref name=buckleysociety/> The likely meaning of the name was \"clearing in a beech wood\" (with ''boc'' meaning beech tree and ''ley'' meaning wood, glade or clearing). The name could also have been construed from ''bucc'', a buck or deer; or ''bwlch y clai'', meaning clay hole.<ref name=buckleysociety>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.buckleysociety.org.uk/about_buckley.htm |title=About Buckley|publisher=Buckley History Society|accessdate=2 September 2009|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1420, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] presented Ewloe and the pastorage of Buckley to his wife, [[Catherine of Valois]], as a wedding present. It was worth \u00a326 per annum.<ref name=buckleytc>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckleytc.org.uk/about-buckley/town-history/|title=History of Buckley|publisher=Buckley Town Council|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe town became an industrial heartland for [[pottery]] and [[coal mining]] between the 17th and 19th centuries.<ref name=buckleysociety/>  The first was opened in 1737. However, it only grew into any kind of prominence during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 18th century, when coal and [[clay]] were extensively mined there, and the name Buckley became synonymous with the production of various fire-clay and pottery products. By the early 19th century, there were 14 potteries in the town.<ref name=buckleytc/>\n\nBuckley was a popular location for [[Mining in Wales|mining]], as there were many faults in local rock formations that allowed seams of coal to be mined directly from the surface. Its heavy, clay soil also allowed for excellent pottery and bricks to be manufactured. Bricks from Buckley were transported all across the United Kingdom and as far as the United States, as Buckley became a brickworking centre. A great deal of people moved into the area, particularly from [[Ireland]] and [[Liverpool]] to find work in the [[mining]] and [[brick]] industries, giving the town a distinctive [[regional accent|accent]]. Many pottery and earthenware products manufactured were taken on the backs of donkeys to either [[Chester]] market or exported via the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], as early as the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The last pottery kiln was fired in 1946. The site of the brickworks is now being redeveloped as a housing estate. However, a local [[cement]] works is still in operation.\n\nIn 1932, a tradition started in Buckley of running an annual [[pantomime]]. Dennis Griffiths produced a version of [[Dick Whittington]] in 1933, and ran the pantomime for 27 years, famously using the programme to invite any and all complaints to arrive written \"on the back of a 10 [[shilling]] note (non-returnable)\".\n\nIn the [[Second World War]], a [[Nazi German]] [[Luftwaffe]] plane, most likely on its way to [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz Liverpool]], was shot down and crash landed in a nearby district, with the plane's engine crashing into a small lake known locally as 'The Trap'. The pilot survived, captured by a [[Special Constabulary|Special Constable]], Peter Griffiths, and taken to Hawarden Prisoner of War camp.\n\n==Governance==\n[[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban district]] status was conferred on the town in 1898; at this time, the area comprised two parishes, Buckley (1874) and Bistre (1844). The urban district of Buckley was formed of  Pentrobin and Bannel (which was formerly a part of the parish of [[Hawarden]]), Argoed, and Bistre (the oldest part of the town). [[Wat's Dyke]] formed the western boundary.<ref name=buckleysociety/>\n\nBefore then, it was divided between the parishes of [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] and [[Hawarden]]. Buckley is part of the [[Alyn and Deeside (UK Parliament constituency)|Alyn and Deeside UK parliamentary constituency]] and the [[Alyn and Deeside (Assembly constituency)|Alyn and Deeside Welsh Assembly constituency]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBuckley is situated in north east Wales approximately 6 miles from the border with England to the East. Buckley is in the lee of the Snowdonian mountain range to the west and is therefore in a rain shadow area. Average annual rainfall in Buckley is approximately {{convert|700|-|800|mm|in|abbr=on}} which is significantly lower than areas to the West of the Snowdonian mountain range. However, in comparison to areas in the East and South East of the United Kingdom, Buckley still receives a fair amount of rainfall. Since Buckley is located approximately {{convert|130|-|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, snowfall is more frequent in winter months in comparison to the lower lying ground in neighbouring areas.\n\nAreas in the parish of Buckley outside the town centre include Bistre, Lane End, Padeswood, Buckley Mountain, Drury, Pentrobin, Bannel, and [[Alltami]].\n\n== Dialect ==\nAlthough very few locals speak with a 'Buckley' accent nowadays, due to people moving in and out of the area, and with the proliferation of television and radio, a few of the town's older citizens still speak in a form of the strongly accented [[dialect]], full of [[colloquialism]]s, and often unintelligible to outsiders. One of the last remaining pure 'Buckley' speakers was noted linguist Dennis Griffiths, a Buckley resident, who died in 1972, and whose books are the main repository and record of the dialect. A few examples (mainly [[phonetic]]) are noted below:\n\n<blockquote>\n*''Wunst every blue moon'' \u2013 rarely occurring\n*''Thou fries me to death'' \u2013 the limit of boredom\n*''A lick and a promise'' \u2013 a quick wash\n*''Fasen the fost un fost'' \u2013 fasten the first one first\n*''The daddy on um aw'' \u2013 the best of the lot\n*''Husht thee naise'' \u2013 be quiet\n*''I conna meke thee out'' \u2013 I can't understand you\n*''Chunner'' \u2013 Complain\n</blockquote>\nThe last 'pure' speaker of the Buckley dialect was Joseph Charles Shone, a foundryman born in 1917, who died in 1987.\nAn example of the Buckley dialect was recorded by community heritage archivist John Butler in 2016. In this item, long-time Buckley resident Margaret Shone recounts one of Dennis Griffiths's specially written stories, an adaptation of the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] into the Buckley dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/546062|title=The Prodigal Son \u2013 a story adapted by Dennis Griffiths|publisher=People\u2019s Collection Wales|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nWorth noting is the effect on the Buckley dialect the of strong links forged with the potteries of Stoke-on-Trent. As the trains shuttled back and forth between the two towns, so did the dialect and the two have many similarities of vocabulary and accent.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Buckley-kiln.gif|thumb|right|180px|The Hanson Cement [[cement kiln|kiln]] under construction in 2005.]]\n\nToday, Buckley has a population of around 20,000, and has numerous light industries. Those who cannot find work locally [[commuting|commute]] to [[Deeside]], [[Cheshire]], [[Wrexham]] and [[Merseyside]].\n\nThe Hanson Cement works at Padeswood is the only large scale industry remaining in the town. Its 200&nbsp;ft kiln is now the major landmark on the skyline, visible from many miles away. Despite many locals considering it an eyesore, according to its website, the company has reduced pollution produced by the cement works by up to 90%.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.castlecement.co.uk/Padeswood/kiln_e.html |title=Cleaner and healthier: The new kiln and the environment |publisher=Hanson Cement |accessdate=25 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824175041/http://www.castlecement.co.uk/Padeswood/kiln_e.html |archivedate=24 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Community facilities==\nBuckley has a large area of [[common land]], known simply as 'The Common'. It has a large playground for children, as well as a duck pond. A [[funfair]] visits during the Buckley Jubilee in the summer, usually on the second Tuesday of July, which is the town jubilee.\n\nThere is also a small lake, known as 'The Trap', which is stocked with [[coarse fish]]. A [[Luftwaffe|German]] [[Messerschmitt]] [[bomber]] crashed into the Trap during [[World War II]], shot down by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] after going off course following a [[Liverpool Blitz|bombing run over Liverpool]]. The land is primarily heavy [[clay]] soil. [[Etna Park]], which is just a short walk from the town centre, is part of the Heritage Trail walk in the area.\n\nBuckley has a shopping precinct, as well as three [[supermarkets]], [[Aldi]], [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] and [[Home Bargains]]. There is a town-centre car park which is charged at 30p per hour. The town contains a wide variety of [[public house]]s, which includes the local [[working men's club]]. The local branch of [[The Royal British Legion]] closed in 2010 and has since been demolished.\n\n==Education==\nBuckley has four [[primary school]]s: Westwood County Primary (Formerly known as West Lea infants and Buckley CP \u2013 juniors) which is on Tabernacle Street, Southdown Primary School on Linderick Avenue, Mountain Lane Primary School on Knowle Lane, and Drury County Primary on Beech Road, Drury.\n\nBuckley has one [[secondary school]], the [[Elfed High School]], located near the Common on Mill Lane. The school includes a sports centre and a [[swimming pool]], for use of both the students and the public. Many students from Buckley also attend [[Argoed High School]], located in nearby [[Bryn-y-Baal]], or the [[Alun School]], in Mold. All schools in Buckley are run by the [[Flintshire Local Education Authority]].\n\n==Religion==\nBuckley is unusual in having two ecclesiastical parishes. The [[St Matthew's Church, Buckley|Church of St Matthew]] is the oldest parish church in the town, and was consecrated in 1822. Bistre Emmanuel Parish Church was built in 1842, despite appearing much older due to its early [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic-style architecture]].<ref name=buckleytc/>  The first [[Primitive Methodist]] church in Wales is on the outskirts of Buckley, in [[Alltami]].\n\nThe present St John's United Reformed Church was originally a chapel known as \"Chapel in the Meadow\", set up by a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|noncomformist]] pottery owner, Jonathan Catherall, in 1811. Before that date, Catherall had held services in his house which he named after Lord Hawkesbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://biography.wales/article/s-CATH-JON-1761|title=Catherall, Jonathan (1761\u20131833), industrialist and philanthropist|work=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]|first=Mary Gwyneth|last=Lewis|date=1959|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> As the Church forbade chapels from having bells, he built a bell tower in the grounds of his home. The site of this unique non-conformist bell tower is marked by a mound and plaque near the [[skate park]] at the Elfed Sports Complex.<ref name=buckleytc/>\n\nThe Our Lady of the Rosary [[Catholic church]] in Buckley was built in 2000 to replace a much older building. Other churches in Buckley include Bistre Methodist, Pentrobin Methodist, Buckley Cross Methodist, Bryn Methodist, and Drury Lane Methodist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=buckley-jubilee-plans-finalised&method=full&objectid=23792042&siteid=50020-name_page.html|title=Buckley Jubilee plans finalised|last=Tattum|first=George|date=4 June 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===Events===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buckley-jubilee-2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The Royal Buckley Town Band at the Buckley Jubilee in 2005]] -->\nBuckley observes an annual regional celebration and march that is over 200 years old called the Buckley Jubilee, which is celebrated on the second Tuesday of July. Officially, however, the Jubilee was begun in 1856. The difference in dates stems from the 'official' date being set when the Buckley [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]] first sanctioned the march. The Jubilee is a ceremonial march that begins on \"The Common\", a large area of common ground owned by the people of the town used for leisure and recreational purposes. The term 'jubilee' was first used in 1871.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20428|title=Buckley Jubilee Procession|publisher=Gathering the Jewels|accessdate=5 August 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120043825/http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20428|archivedate=20 November 2005}}</ref>\n\nA non-denominational Service led by the minister of the church or chapel leading the Jubilee that year is held on the Common, starting at around 3pm. The Sunday before the Jubilee, the leading church is presented with the Centenary Shield, which they hold for the year. A fifteen-minute service takes place, with two hymns accompanied by the Royal Buckley Town Band. The march then leaves the common, and marches through the town, with representatives from the local [[Sunday School]]s, [[Scouting in Clwyd|Scout]] and [[Girlguiding UK|Guide]] troops, and many of the local schools. Banners from each of the local churches are carried.<ref name=buckleytc/>\n\n===Royal Buckley Town Band===\nBuckley has a famous [[brass band]], the Royal Buckley Town Band. The band is one of only two in the entire United Kingdom to have received sanction from a [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] to use \"[[monarchy|Royal]]\" in their name. They lead the Jubilee every year.\n\n===Popular music===\nBuckley has one nightclub, the Tivoli Nightclub (known locally as \"The Tiv\"), on Brunswick Road. Formerly both a cinema and a music hall, the Tivoli has seen many bands play there over the years, including [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] in the early 1970s, and many [[Britpop]] bands including [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]] and the [[Super Furry Animals]] in the 1990s. It has been described as 'one of the finest quirky little venues of our time' and is featured in the [[DVD]] re-issue of Oasis's album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://xrrf.blogspot.com/2004/07/recapture-that-spark-opportunity-to.html|title=Recapture That Spark|publisher=No Rock and Roll Fun|date=6 July 2004|accessdate=25 September 2005|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Between summer 1992 and spring 1993, [[Radiohead]] played there twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/index.php?year=1992|title=Radiohead gigography|accessdate=14 June 2006|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Bands such as [[Cast (band)|Cast]], [[Ash (band)|Ash]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Fun Lovin' Criminals]], [[Skindred]], [[Hed PE]] and [[OPM (band)|OPM]] have all played there. Since a renovation and rebranding in 2000, few bands played live at the venue, with the club music policy having more emphasis on commercial [[Dance music|dance]] and pop music, with a [[Rock music|rock]] night on Fridays. The venue attracts crowds from [[Chester]], [[Wrexham]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]].\n\n===Radio===\nThe town was also home to a [[community radio]] project which used to broadcast 'trial' or 'temporary radio' licences to Buckley, [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]], [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]], [[Deeside]] and the surrounding areas. The station was known as South Flintshire Radio and its offices were found above the swimming baths on Mold Road. The station was heard on eight separate occasions between November 1996 and July 2000 as part of a campaign to bring a local radio station to [[Flintshire]], following the demise of Mold-based BBC Radio Clwyd. The project helped pave the way for a permanent local radio licence which was awarded to Chester FM (known as [[Dee 106.3]]) which broadcasts to [[Chester]], [[Ellesmere Port]], Deeside and Buckley.\n\n===Library===\nBuckley has a sizable two-storey [[library]], with the second level being dedicated solely to history and reference pieces, mainly on the local area. The second floor also doubles as the local [[museum]].\n\n==Sport==\nBuckley has a [[Association football|football]] club in the [[Cymru Alliance]], [[Buckley Town F.C.]]. In addition to the men's team Buckley also has a women's team, Buckley Town Ladies FC, who play in the North Wales Coast Women's Football League.\n\nThe Elfed Sports Complex was built in 2005, near the [[Elfed High School]], and includes a swimming pool, which replaced the outdated, Victorian-style baths on the Mold Road high street.\n\n==Transport==\n===Road===\nBuckley is located on the [[A549 road]], and is near the [[A55 road|A55 expressway]], which passes to the south of [[Ewloe]].\n\n===Bus===\nThere are a number of bus routes that pass through Buckley, mostly operated by [[Arriva Buses Wales]], which now means on most weekdays a bus to [[Chester]] or [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] is available every 10 minutes.\n\n===Rail===\nBuckley has previously been served by up to three different stations on lines operated by the [[Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway]] and the [[Mold Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/b/buckley/index.shtml|title=Disused Stations: BUCKLEY (1st) Station|date=17 May 2011|accessdate=12 October 2016|publisher=Disused Stations|others=contributed by Paul Wright}}</ref> Services to Mold and Connah's Quay have been discontinued and the old train lines removed.

However, the first documented evidence of its existence dates from 1294 when it was described as the pasturage of the Manor of Ewloe, spelled as \"Bokkeley\".<ref name=buckleysociety/>\n\nThe name Buckley may derive from the [[Old English]] ''bok lee'', meaning meadow, or field.<ref name=buckleysociety/> The likely meaning of the name was \"clearing in a beech wood\" (with ''boc'' meaning beech tree and ''ley'' meaning wood, glade or clearing). The name could also have been construed from ''bucc'', a buck or deer; or ''bwlch y clai'', meaning clay hole.<ref name=buckleysociety>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.buckleysociety.org.uk/about_buckley.htm |title=About Buckley|publisher=Buckley History Society|accessdate=2 September 2009|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1420, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] presented Ewloe and the pastorage of Buckley to his wife, [[Catherine of Valois]], as a wedding present. It was worth \u00a326 per annum.<ref name=buckleytc>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckleytc.org.uk/about-buckley/town-history/|title=History of Buckley|publisher=Buckley Town Council|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe town became an industrial heartland for [[pottery]] and [[coal mining]] between the 17th and 19th centuries.<ref name=buckleysociety/>  The first was opened in 1737. However, it only grew into any kind of prominence during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 18th century, when coal and [[clay]] were extensively mined there, and the name Buckley became synonymous with the production of various fire-clay and pottery products. By the early 19th century, there were 14 potteries in the town.<ref name=buckleytc/>\n\nBuckley was a popular location for [[Mining in Wales|mining]], as there were many faults in local rock formations that allowed seams of coal to be mined directly from the surface. Its heavy, clay soil also allowed for excellent pottery and bricks to be manufactured. Bricks from Buckley were transported all across the United Kingdom and as far as the United States, as Buckley became a brickworking centre. A great deal of people moved into the area, particularly from [[Ireland]] and [[Liverpool]] to find work in the [[mining]] and [[brick]] industries, giving the town a distinctive [[regional accent|accent]]. Many pottery and earthenware products manufactured were taken on the backs of donkeys to either [[Chester]] market or exported via the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], as early as the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The last pottery kiln was fired in 1946. The site of the brickworks is now being redeveloped as a housing estate. However, a local [[cement]] works is still in operation.\n\nIn 1932, a tradition started in Buckley of running an annual [[pantomime]]. Dennis Griffiths produced a version of [[Dick Whittington]] in 1933, and ran the pantomime for 27 years, famously using the programme to invite any and all complaints to arrive written \"on the back of a 10 [[shilling]] note (non-returnable)\".\n\nIn the [[Second World War]], a [[Nazi German]] [[Luftwaffe]] plane, most likely on its way to [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz Liverpool]], was shot down and crash landed in a nearby district, with the plane's engine crashing into a small lake known locally as 'The Trap'. The pilot survived, captured by a [[Special Constabulary|Special Constable]], Peter Griffiths, and taken to Hawarden Prisoner of War camp.\n\n==Governance==\n[[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban district]] status was conferred on the town in 1898; at this time, the area comprised two parishes, Buckley (1874) and Bistre (1844). The urban district of Buckley was formed of  Pentrobin and Bannel (which was formerly a part of the parish of [[Hawarden]]), Argoed, and Bistre (the oldest part of the town). [[Wat's Dyke]] formed the western boundary.<ref name=buckleysociety/>\n\nBefore then, it was divided between the parishes of [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] and [[Hawarden]]. Buckley is part of the [[Alyn and Deeside (UK Parliament constituency)|Alyn and Deeside UK parliamentary constituency]] and the [[Alyn and Deeside (Assembly constituency)|Alyn and Deeside Welsh Assembly constituency]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBuckley is situated in north east Wales approximately 6 miles from the border with England to the East. Buckley is in the lee of the Snowdonian mountain range to the west and is therefore in a rain shadow area. Average annual rainfall in Buckley is approximately {{convert|700|-|800|mm|in|abbr=on}} which is significantly lower than areas to the West of the Snowdonian mountain range. However, in comparison to areas in the East and South East of the United Kingdom, Buckley still receives a fair amount of rainfall. Since Buckley is located approximately {{convert|130|-|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, snowfall is more frequent in winter months in comparison to the lower lying ground in neighbouring areas.\n\nAreas in the parish of Buckley outside the town centre include Bistre, Lane End, Padeswood, Buckley Mountain, Drury, Pentrobin, Bannel, and [[Alltami]].\n\n== Dialect ==\nAlthough very few locals speak with a 'Buckley' accent nowadays, due to people moving in and out of the area, and with the proliferation of television and radio, a few of the town's older citizens still speak in a form of the strongly accented [[dialect]], full of [[colloquialism]]s, and often unintelligible to outsiders. One of the last remaining pure 'Buckley' speakers was noted linguist Dennis Griffiths, a Buckley resident, who died in 1972, and whose books are the main repository and record of the dialect. A few examples (mainly [[phonetic]]) are noted below:\n\n<blockquote>\n*''Wunst every blue moon'' \u2013 rarely occurring\n*''Thou fries me to death'' \u2013 the limit of boredom\n*''A lick and a promise'' \u2013 a quick wash\n*''Fasen the fost un fost'' \u2013 fasten the first one first\n*''The daddy on um aw'' \u2013 the best of the lot\n*''Husht thee naise'' \u2013 be quiet\n*''I conna meke thee out'' \u2013 I can't understand you\n*''Chunner'' \u2013 Complain\n</blockquote>\nThe last 'pure' speaker of the Buckley dialect was Joseph Charles Shone, a foundryman born in 1917, who died in 1987.\nAn example of the Buckley dialect was recorded by community heritage archivist John Butler in 2016. In this item, long-time Buckley resident Margaret Shone recounts one of Dennis Griffiths's specially written stories, an adaptation of the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] into the Buckley dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/546062|title=The Prodigal Son \u2013 a story adapted by Dennis Griffiths|publisher=People\u2019s Collection Wales|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Buckley-kiln.gif|thumb|right|180px|The Hanson Cement [[cement kiln|kiln]] under construction in 2005.]]\n\nToday, Buckley has a population of around 20,000, and has numerous light industries. Those who cannot find work locally [[commuting|commute]] to [[Deeside]], [[Cheshire]], [[Wrexham]] and [[Merseyside]].\n\nThe Hanson Cement works at Padeswood is the only large scale industry remaining in the town. Its 200&nbsp;ft kiln is now the major landmark on the skyline, visible from many miles away. Despite many locals considering it an eyesore, according to its website, the company has reduced pollution produced by the cement works by up to 90%.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.castlecement.co.uk/Padeswood/kiln_e.html |title=Cleaner and healthier: The new kiln and the environment |publisher=Hanson Cement |accessdate=25 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824175041/http://www.castlecement.co.uk/Padeswood/kiln_e.html |archivedate=24 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Community facilities==\nBuckley has a large area of [[common land]], known simply as 'The Common'. It has a large playground for children, as well as a duck pond. A [[funfair]] visits during the Buckley Jubilee in the summer, usually on the second Tuesday of July, which is the town jubilee.\n\nThere is also a small lake, known as 'The Trap', which is stocked with [[coarse fish]]. A [[Luftwaffe|German]] [[Messerschmitt]] [[bomber]] crashed into the Trap during [[World War II]], shot down by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] after going off course following a [[Liverpool Blitz|bombing run over Liverpool]]. The land is primarily heavy [[clay]] soil. [[Etna Park]], which is just a short walk from the town centre, is part of the Heritage Trail walk in the area.\n\nBuckley has a shopping precinct, as well as three [[supermarkets]], [[Aldi]], [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] and [[Home Bargains]]. There is a town-centre car park which is charged at 30p per hour. The town contains a wide variety of [[public house]]s, which includes the local [[working men's club]]. The local branch of [[The Royal British Legion]] closed in 2010 and has since been demolished.\n\n==Education==\nBuckley has four [[primary school]]s: Westwood County Primary (Formerly known as West Lea infants and Buckley CP \u2013 juniors) which is on Tabernacle Street, Southdown Primary School on Linderick Avenue, Mountain Lane Primary School on Knowle Lane, and Drury County Primary on Beech Road, Drury.\n\nBuckley has one [[secondary school]], the [[Elfed High School]], located near the Common on Mill Lane. The school includes a sports centre and a [[swimming pool]], for use of both the students and the public. Many students from Buckley also attend [[Argoed High School]], located in nearby [[Bryn-y-Baal]], or the [[Alun School]], in Mold. All schools in Buckley are run by the [[Flintshire Local Education Authority]].\n\n==Religion==\nBuckley is unusual in having two ecclesiastical parishes. The [[St Matthew's Church, Buckley|Church of St Matthew]] is the oldest parish church in the town, and was consecrated in 1822. Bistre Emmanuel Parish Church was built in 1842, despite appearing much older due to its early [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic-style architecture]].<ref name=buckleytc/>  The first [[Primitive Methodist]] church in Wales is on the outskirts of Buckley, in [[Alltami]].\n\nThe present St John's United Reformed Church was originally a chapel known as \"Chapel in the Meadow\", set up by a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|noncomformist]] pottery owner, Jonathan Catherall, in 1811. Before that date, Catherall had held services in his house which he named after Lord Hawkesbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://biography.wales/article/s-CATH-JON-1761|title=Catherall, Jonathan (1761\u20131833), industrialist and philanthropist|work=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]|first=Mary Gwyneth|last=Lewis|date=1959|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> As the Church forbade chapels from having bells, he built a bell tower in the grounds of his home. The site of this unique non-conformist bell tower is marked by a mound and plaque near the [[skate park]] at the Elfed Sports Complex.<ref name=buckleytc/>\n\nThe Our Lady of the Rosary [[Catholic church]] in Buckley was built in 2000 to replace a much older building. Other churches in Buckley include Bistre Methodist, Pentrobin Methodist, Buckley Cross Methodist, Bryn Methodist, and Drury Lane Methodist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=buckley-jubilee-plans-finalised&method=full&objectid=23792042&siteid=50020-name_page.html|title=Buckley Jubilee plans finalised|last=Tattum|first=George|date=4 June 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===Events===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buckley-jubilee-2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The Royal Buckley Town Band at the Buckley Jubilee in 2005]] -->\nBuckley observes an annual regional celebration and march that is over 200 years old called the Buckley Jubilee, which is celebrated on the second Tuesday of July. Officially, however, the Jubilee was begun in 1856. The difference in dates stems from the 'official' date being set when the Buckley [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]] first sanctioned the march. The Jubilee is a ceremonial march that begins on \"The Common\", a large area of common ground owned by the people of the town used for leisure and recreational purposes. The term 'jubilee' was first used in 1871.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20428|title=Buckley Jubilee Procession|publisher=Gathering the Jewels|accessdate=5 August 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120043825/http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20428|archivedate=20 November 2005}}</ref>\n\nA non-denominational Service led by the minister of the church or chapel leading the Jubilee that year is held on the Common, starting at around 3pm. The Sunday before the Jubilee, the leading church is presented with the Centenary Shield, which they hold for the year. A fifteen-minute service takes place, with two hymns accompanied by the Royal Buckley Town Band. The march then leaves the common, and marches through the town, with representatives from the local [[Sunday School]]s, [[Scouting in Clwyd|Scout]] and [[Girlguiding UK|Guide]] troops, and many of the local schools. Banners from each of the local churches are carried.<ref name=buckleytc/>\n\n===Royal Buckley Town Band===\nBuckley has a famous [[brass band]], the Royal Buckley Town Band. The band is one of only two in the entire United Kingdom to have received sanction from a [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] to use \"[[monarchy|Royal]]\" in their name. They lead the Jubilee every year.\n\n===Popular music===\nBuckley has one nightclub, the Tivoli Nightclub (known locally as \"The Tiv\"), on Brunswick Road. Formerly both a cinema and a music hall, the Tivoli has seen many bands play there over the years, including [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] in the early 1970s, and many [[Britpop]] bands including [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]] and the [[Super Furry Animals]] in the 1990s. It has been described as 'one of the finest quirky little venues of our time' and is featured in the [[DVD]] re-issue of Oasis's album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://xrrf.blogspot.com/2004/07/recapture-that-spark-opportunity-to.html|title=Recapture That Spark|publisher=No Rock and Roll Fun|date=6 July 2004|accessdate=25 September 2005|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Between summer 1992 and spring 1993, [[Radiohead]] played there twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/index.php?year=1992|title=Radiohead gigography|accessdate=14 June 2006|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Bands such as [[Cast (band)|Cast]], [[Ash (band)|Ash]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Fun Lovin' Criminals]], [[Skindred]], [[Hed PE]] and [[OPM (band)|OPM]] have all played there. Since a renovation and rebranding in 2000, few bands played live at the venue, with the club music policy having more emphasis on commercial [[Dance music|dance]] and pop music, with a [[Rock music|rock]] night on Fridays. The venue attracts crowds from [[Chester]], [[Wrexham]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]].\n\n===Radio===\nThe town was also home to a [[community radio]] project which used to broadcast 'trial' or 'temporary radio' licences to Buckley, [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]], [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]], [[Deeside]] and the surrounding areas. The station was known as South Flintshire Radio and its offices were found above the swimming baths on Mold Road. The station was heard on eight separate occasions between November 1996 and July 2000 as part of a campaign to bring a local radio station to [[Flintshire]], following the demise of Mold-based BBC Radio Clwyd. The project helped pave the way for a permanent local radio licence which was awarded to Chester FM (known as [[Dee 106.3]]) which broadcasts to [[Chester]], [[Ellesmere Port]], Deeside and Buckley.\n\n===Library===\nBuckley has a sizable two-storey [[library]], with the second level being dedicated solely to history and reference pieces, mainly on the local area. The second floor also doubles as the local [[museum]].\n\n==Sport==\nBuckley has a [[Association football|football]] club in the [[Cymru Alliance]], [[Buckley Town F.C.]]. In addition to the men's team Buckley also has a women's team, Buckley Town Ladies FC, who play in the North Wales Coast Women's Football League.\n\nThe Elfed Sports Complex was built in 2005, near the [[Elfed High School]], and includes a swimming pool, which replaced the outdated, Victorian-style baths on the Mold Road high street.\n\n==Transport==\n===Road===\nBuckley is located on the [[A549 road]], and is near the [[A55 road|A55 expressway]], which passes to the south of [[Ewloe]].\n\n===Bus===\nThere are a number of bus routes that pass through Buckley, mostly operated by [[Arriva Buses Wales]], which now means on most weekdays a bus to [[Chester]] or [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] is available every 10 minutes.\n\n===Rail===\nBuckley has previously been served by up to three different stations on lines operated by the [[Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway]] and the [[Mold Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/b/buckley/index.shtml|title=Disused Stations: BUCKLEY (1st) Station|date=17 May 2011|accessdate=12 October 2016|publisher=Disused Stations|others=contributed by Paul Wright}}</ref> Services to Mold and Connah's Quay have been discontinued and the old train lines removed.

In that year [[Pope Clement XI]], at the request of [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]], established the Diocese of Biella by the [[papal bull]] ''Praecipua''.<ref>Cappeletti, pp. 649-662, with the text of the Bull of Clement XI.</ref>\n\nThe first bishop was [[Giulio Cesare Viancini]], formerly [[Archbishop of Sassari]] in Sardinia. In 1803 Napoleon suppressed the diocese, which again fell under the jurisdiction of Vercelli, but was re-established in 1817 by [[Pope Pius VII]] who appointed as bishop the Observant Franciscan, [[Bernardino Bollati]].\n\nIn the [[Sanctuary of Oropa|shrine of Maria Santissima d'Oropa]], situated on a mountain near Biella,<ref>Rando (ed.), pp. 77-82. {{cite book|author=Gustavo Avogadro de Valdengo|title=Storia del santuario di Nostra Signora d'Oropa ne' monti di Biella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqxdAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA154|year=1846|publisher=Stamperia Reale|location=Torino|language=Italian}}</ref> the diocese preserves a memorial of [[St. Eusebius of Vercelli]], who was banished to the Orient by [[Constantius II|Emperor Constantius]] for his defence of Catholicism against [[Arianism]]. St. Eusebius, according to tradition,{{weasel inline|date=October 2016}} upon his return from the East, is said{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} to have brought three pictures of the Madonna painted on cedar wood, one of which, the [[Black Virgin of Oropa|image of Oropa]], he placed in a small oratory he had built. In the tenth century the chapel was placed in charge of the Benedictines. When they abandoned the place, [[Pope Pius II]], in 1459, made over the shrine to the Chapter of the Collegiate Church of San Stefano, now the [[Biella Cathedral]], to which it has since belonged. In the sixteenth century, the inhabitants of Biella, in thanksgiving for their deliverance from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], built a church over the chapel. In the seventeenth century construction of the devotional complex known as the [[Sacro Monte di Oropa]] began.\n\nAmong the religious edifices of the city of Biella, the most notable is the Gothic cathedral, built in 1402.<ref>Rando (ed.), pp. 38-39.</ref> Its beautiful choir is by [[Galliari]]. The [[baptistery]], in the form of a small temple, is said to be an ancient Roman edifice. It is in fact a work of the eleventh century, erected on the site of a Roman tomb.<ref>Rando (ed.), p. 38.

In that year [[Pope Clement XI]], at the request of [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]], established the Diocese of Biella by the [[papal bull]] ''Praecipua''.<ref>Cappeletti, pp. 649-662, with the text of the Bull of Clement XI.</ref>\n\nThe first bishop was [[Giulio Cesare Viancini]], formerly [[Archbishop of Sassari]] in Sardinia. In 1803 Napoleon suppressed the diocese, which again fell under the jurisdiction of Vercelli, but was re-established in 1817 by [[Pope Pius VII]] who appointed as bishop the Observant Franciscan, [[Bernardino Bollati]].\n\nIn the [[Sanctuary of Oropa|shrine of Maria Santissima d'Oropa]], situated on a mountain near Biella,<ref>Rando (ed.), pp. 77-82. {{cite book|author=Gustavo Avogadro de Valdengo|title=Storia del santuario di Nostra Signora d'Oropa ne' monti di Biella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqxdAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA154|year=1846|publisher=Stamperia Reale|location=Torino|language=Italian}}</ref> the diocese preserves a memorial of [[St. Eusebius of Vercelli]], who was banished to the Orient by [[Constantius II|Emperor Constantius]] for his defence of Catholicism against [[Arianism]]. St. Eusebius, according to tradition,{{weasel inline|date=October 2016}} upon his return from the East, is said{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} to have brought three pictures of the Madonna painted on cedar wood, one of which, the [[Black Virgin of Oropa|image of Oropa]], he placed in a small oratory he had built. In the tenth century the chapel was placed in charge of the Benedictines. When they abandoned the place, [[Pope Pius II]], in 1459, made over the shrine to the Chapter of the Collegiate Church of San Stefano, now the [[Biella Cathedral]], to which it has since belonged. In the sixteenth century, the inhabitants of Biella, in thanksgiving for their deliverance from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], built a church over the chapel. In the seventeenth century construction of the devotional complex known as the [[Sacro Monte di Oropa]] began.\n\nAmong the religious edifices of the city of Biella, the most notable is the Gothic cathedral, built in 1402.<ref>Rando (ed.), pp. 38-39.</ref> Its beautiful choir is by [[Galliari]]. The [[baptistery]], in the form of a small temple, is said to be an ancient Roman edifice. It is in fact a work of the eleventh century, erected on the site of a Roman tomb.<ref>Rando (ed.), p. 38.

Throughout its existence there was tension between the diocese, the [[Patriarch of Grado|Patriarchate of Grado]] to which it was nominally subordinate, and the [[Doge]] of Venice. Eventually in 1451 the diocese and the patriarchate were merged to form the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice|Archdiocese of Venice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n\nThe diocese has its origins in the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]], founded during the [[Roman Empire]]. Hilarius of Panonia is recorded as bishop of Aquileia from about 276\u2013285. As the empire fell into decline, Aquileia was sacked in turn by [[Visigoths]] (403), [[Huns]] (452) and [[Lombards]] (659). During these times of trouble some of the people would take refuge on the offshore islands. By 630 an independent [[Patriarch of Grado]] was established on the island of [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]].{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\n\nThe islands of Venice had originally been subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Padua|Diocese of Padua]].\nIn 774 [[Pope Adrian I]] and John IV, Patriarch of Grado, authorized the establishment of an episcopal see on the [[island of Olivolo]].{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\nThe bishopric was established in 774\u2013775 by the Duke of [[Malamocco]], who gave it his protection. Its cathedral was dedicated to [[Saint Peter]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\nThe Bishop of Olivolo was subordinate to Grado and had jurisdiction over the islands of Gemini, Rialto, Luprio and Dorsoduro, the main islands of the city of Venice.{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\nThe bishopric, taken from the [[Diocese of Malamocco]] (Methamancus), formed a small new state, the nucleus of the state of Venice.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\n===Olivolo===\n\nThe first bishop was Obelerius. He was invested and enthroned by the doge, and consecrated by the Patriarch of Grado.\nIn 798 the doge nominated Cristoforo as his successor. Giovanni, patriarch of Grado, refused to consecrate Cristoforo due to his youth. \nGiovanni was killed for his disobedience and his successor consecrated Cristoforo.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nFrom his name, which is Greek, Cristoforo may have been Byzantine.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\n\nAt that time Italy was the seen of a struggle between the Lombards and Byzantines, and many in Venice were loyal to Byzantium.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\nThe [[Franks]] rose to power in the last half of the 8th century, and in 800 [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]] as Emperor.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}}\nIn 802 a faction that was friendly to the Franks came to power in Malamocco, and sent the [[Doge]]s Giovanni and Maurizio II into exile, along with the bishop of Olivolo.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=14}}\nIn 810 a Byzantine fleet helped restore the party that favored Byzantium, and Angelo I Participazzo was made doge.\nAn attempt by the Franks to conquer the [[Venetian Lagoon]] failed, and after long negotiations it was agreed that Venice fell in the Byzantine sphere, while Venetian merchants could trade throughout the western empire. The Doge made his seat on the island of Rialto, and with the surrounding islands including Olivolo the new state started to take the name of Venetiae.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\nIn the ninth century the relics of saints Sergios and Bacchus were placed in the cathedral at Olivolo by the pro-Greek faction.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=25}}\nThe church of San Pietro di Castello was built by Orso Participazio, the fourth bishop of Olivolo. It was burned down several times.{{sfn|Oppenheim|1798|p=221}}{{efn|In 1621 the church of San Pietro di Castello was rebuilt from the ground at the expense of the patriarch Giovanni Tiepolo.{{sfn|Oppenheim|1798|p=222}} }}\n\nIn 828, the second year of the Doge [[Giustiniano Participazio]], the [[Caliph]] had ordered that the Christian churches of [[Alexandria]], Egypt, be pulled down so their marble columns could be used for his palace.{{sfn|Sethre|2003|p=23}}\nThe body of Saint [[Mark the Evangelist]] was smuggled out from the church of Saint Mark to Venice. \nTo discourage the \"Saracens\" from examining the coffin, it was filled with pork.{{sfn|Sethre|2003|p=24}}\nWhen the ship reached [[Olivolo island]] in Venice, the saint made signs that showed he did not want to be placed in the custody of the bishop. Instead, he was taken to the Doge's chapel, and planning began to create a magnificent new temple suitable for such important relics.{{sfn|Sethre|2003|p=25}}\nThe motives for the robbery of the saint's body were in part to establish the importance of the city of Venice, as opposed to the sees of Grado and Olivolo, relative to the patriarchate of Aquileia.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=25}}\n\nIn 853 Orso, bishop of Olivolo, left his property to his sister Romana, She was to guard it from future bishops who might not be worthy.{{sfn|Macy|2007|p=68}}\nHe decreed that if his successor mismanaged the property of the diocese, after his death she should have the power to ordain the basilica of St. Laurence to whomever she chose.{{sfn|Macy|2007|p=34}}\nThe new state fought off challenges from Croats, Saracens and Hungarians, and under [[Pietro II Candiano]] (932\u2013939) began to expand on the mainland.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nUnder [[Pietro IV Candiano]] (959\u2013976) the [[Great Council of Venice]] appeared, a body that included the bishops of the Venetian territories and that approved all laws.\nThe Latin cities of the [[Istria]]n and [[Dalmatia]]n coast, threatened by [[Slavs]], placed themselves under the authority of Venice, and the Byzantine emperor consented to the Doge assuming the title of Duke of Dalmatia.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\nIn 1001 the bishop Peter Martuseo, of the Quinta Bella family, built the church of San Agostino.{{sfn|Oppenheim|1798|p=279}}\nIn 1046 Bishop Domenico Gradenigo and Patriarch Orso Orscolo participated in the council of bishops in Saint Mark's called by the Doge [[Domenico Flabanico]]. \nThe council made important decisions about organization and worship, including a decision that a priest could not be consecrated before the age of thirty, except in extraordinary circumstances.{{sfn|Boito|1888|p=69}}\n\n===Castello===\n\nIn 1074, the Bishop of Olivolo began to be styled the Bishop of Castello.\n[[Enrico Contarini]] was the first to hold this title.{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\nHe was the son of the Doge [[Domenico I Contarini|Domenico Contarini]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=72}}\nIn 1084 the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in his Golden Bull recognized the full independence of Venice, along with freedom from tributes, trade restrictions and customs duties.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\nThe Doge [[Vitale Michiel]] (1096\u20131112) held back from participating in the [[First Crusade]] until he saw the amount of loot that the Genoese and Pisans were bringing back from Palestine.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nIn 1099 Enrico Contarini was the spiritual leader of the fleet of about 200 ships that Michiel sent to assist in the crusade in the Levant. \nThe fleet sailed to [[Rhodes]], where it wintered. \nThe emperor of Byzantium asked the Venetians not to proceed, but the bishop overcame any who were inclined to listen to this request.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=71}}\nIn the spring of 1100 the fleet went on to [[Myra]] in Asia Minor, where they obtained the remains of [[Saint Nicholas]], his uncle Nicholas and Saint [[Theodore the Martyr]].

Throughout its existence there was tension between the diocese, the [[Patriarch of Grado|Patriarchate of Grado]] to which it was nominally subordinate, and the [[Doge]] of Venice. Eventually in 1451 the diocese and the patriarchate were merged to form the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice|Archdiocese of Venice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n\nThe diocese has its origins in the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]], founded during the [[Roman Empire]]. Hilarius of Panonia is recorded as bishop of Aquileia from about 276\u2013285. As the empire fell into decline, Aquileia was sacked in turn by [[Visigoths]] (403), [[Huns]] (452) and [[Lombards]] (659). During these times of trouble some of the people would take refuge on the offshore islands. By 630 an independent [[Patriarch of Grado]] was established on the island of [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]].{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\n\nThe islands of Venice had originally been subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Padua|Diocese of Padua]].\nIn 774 [[Pope Adrian I]] and John IV, Patriarch of Grado, authorized the establishment of an episcopal see on the [[island of Olivolo]].{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\nThe bishopric was established in 774\u2013775 by the Duke of [[Malamocco]], who gave it his protection. Its cathedral was dedicated to [[Saint Peter]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\nThe Bishop of Olivolo was subordinate to Grado and had jurisdiction over the islands of Gemini, Rialto, Luprio and Dorsoduro, the main islands of the city of Venice.{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\nThe bishopric, taken from the [[Diocese of Malamocco]] (Methamancus), formed a small new state, the nucleus of the state of Venice.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\n===Olivolo===\n\nThe first bishop was Obelerius. He was invested and enthroned by the doge, and consecrated by the Patriarch of Grado.\nIn 798 the doge nominated Cristoforo as his successor. Giovanni, patriarch of Grado, refused to consecrate Cristoforo due to his youth. \nGiovanni was killed for his disobedience and his successor consecrated Cristoforo.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nFrom his name, which is Greek, Cristoforo may have been Byzantine.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\n\nAt that time Italy was the seen of a struggle between the Lombards and Byzantines, and many in Venice were loyal to Byzantium.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\nThe [[Franks]] rose to power in the last half of the 8th century, and in 800 [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]] as Emperor.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}}\nIn 802 a faction that was friendly to the Franks came to power in Malamocco, and sent the [[Doge]]s Giovanni and Maurizio II into exile, along with the bishop of Olivolo.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=14}}\nIn 810 a Byzantine fleet helped restore the party that favored Byzantium, and Angelo I Participazzo was made doge.\nAn attempt by the Franks to conquer the [[Venetian Lagoon]] failed, and after long negotiations it was agreed that Venice fell in the Byzantine sphere, while Venetian merchants could trade throughout the western empire. The Doge made his seat on the island of Rialto, and with the surrounding islands including Olivolo the new state started to take the name of Venetiae.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\nIn the ninth century the relics of saints Sergios and Bacchus were placed in the cathedral at Olivolo by the pro-Greek faction.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=25}}\nThe church of San Pietro di Castello was built by Orso Participazio, the fourth bishop of Olivolo. It was burned down several times.{{sfn|Oppenheim|1798|p=221}}{{efn|In 1621 the church of San Pietro di Castello was rebuilt from the ground at the expense of the patriarch Giovanni Tiepolo.{{sfn|Oppenheim|1798|p=222}} }}\n\nIn 828, the second year of the Doge [[Giustiniano Participazio]], the [[Caliph]] had ordered that the Christian churches of [[Alexandria]], Egypt, be pulled down so their marble columns could be used for his palace.{{sfn|Sethre|2003|p=23}}\nThe body of Saint [[Mark the Evangelist]] was smuggled out from the church of Saint Mark to Venice. \nTo discourage the \"Saracens\" from examining the coffin, it was filled with pork.{{sfn|Sethre|2003|p=24}}\nWhen the ship reached [[Olivolo island]] in Venice, the saint made signs that showed he did not want to be placed in the custody of the bishop. Instead, he was taken to the Doge's chapel, and planning began to create a magnificent new temple suitable for such important relics.{{sfn|Sethre|2003|p=25}}\nThe motives for the robbery of the saint's body were in part to establish the importance of the city of Venice, as opposed to the sees of Grado and Olivolo, relative to the patriarchate of Aquileia.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=25}}\n\nIn 853 Orso, bishop of Olivolo, left his property to his sister Romana, She was to guard it from future bishops who might not be worthy.{{sfn|Macy|2007|p=68}}\nHe decreed that if his successor mismanaged the property of the diocese, after his death she should have the power to ordain the basilica of St. Laurence to whomever she chose.{{sfn|Macy|2007|p=34}}\nThe new state fought off challenges from Croats, Saracens and Hungarians, and under [[Pietro II Candiano]] (932\u2013939) began to expand on the mainland.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nUnder [[Pietro IV Candiano]] (959\u2013976) the [[Great Council of Venice]] appeared, a body that included the bishops of the Venetian territories and that approved all laws.\nThe Latin cities of the [[Istria]]n and [[Dalmatia]]n coast, threatened by [[Slavs]], placed themselves under the authority of Venice, and the Byzantine emperor consented to the Doge assuming the title of Duke of Dalmatia.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\nIn 1001 the bishop Peter Martuseo, of the Quinta Bella family, built the church of San Agostino.{{sfn|Oppenheim|1798|p=279}}\nIn 1046 Bishop Domenico Gradenigo and Patriarch Orso Orscolo participated in the council of bishops in Saint Mark's called by the Doge [[Domenico Flabanico]]. \nThe council made important decisions about organization and worship, including a decision that a priest could not be consecrated before the age of thirty, except in extraordinary circumstances.{{sfn|Boito|1888|p=69}}\n\n===Castello===\n\nIn 1074, the Bishop of Olivolo began to be styled the Bishop of Castello.\n[[Enrico Contarini]] was the first to hold this title.{{sfn|Ross|2012}}\nHe was the son of the Doge [[Domenico I Contarini|Domenico Contarini]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=72}}\nIn 1084 the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in his Golden Bull recognized the full independence of Venice, along with freedom from tributes, trade restrictions and customs duties.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\n\nThe Doge [[Vitale Michiel]] (1096\u20131112) held back from participating in the [[First Crusade]] until he saw the amount of loot that the Genoese and Pisans were bringing back from Palestine.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nIn 1099 Enrico Contarini was the spiritual leader of the fleet of about 200 ships that Michiel sent to assist in the crusade in the Levant. \nThe fleet sailed to [[Rhodes]], where it wintered. \nThe emperor of Byzantium asked the Venetians not to proceed, but the bishop overcame any who were inclined to listen to this request.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=71}}\nIn the spring of 1100 the fleet went on to [[Myra]] in Asia Minor, where they obtained the remains of [[Saint Nicholas]], his uncle Nicholas and Saint [[Theodore the Martyr]].

Under Bishop Nicolo' Morosini (1336\u20131367) the dispute between the clergy and Government concerning the mortuary tithes was settled.\nThis dispute flared up again under Bishop Paolo Foscari (1367\u20131375) and was ended only in 1376.\nDuring the [[Western Schism]] (1378 to 1418) Venice always adhered to the Roman claimant.{{sfn|Venice: Catholic Encyclopedia}}\nAround 1418 Bishop Marco Lando (1417\u20131426) prescribed adoption of elements of the [[Roman Rite]] in conformity with Rome.{{sfn|Boito|1888|p=175}}\n\nOn 8 October 1451 the diocese was suppressed and its territory transferred to the newly created Patriarchal See of Venezia, or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]].<ref name=regis_aeterni>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=DklEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA107 Translatio patriarchalis Ecclesiae Graden. ad civitatem Venetiarum, cum suppressione tituli eiusdem Ecclesiae Gradensis]\", in: ''Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio'', vol. 5 (Turin: Franco et Dalmazzo, 1860), pp. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nIn 1969 the diocese was restored as the Titular Episcopal See of Castello.{{sfn|Titular Episcopal See of Castello: GCatholic}}\n\n==Office holders==\n\n===Bishops of Olivolo===\nBishops of Olivolo were:{{sfn|Titular Episcopal See of Castello: GCatholic}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Obelerius  (775\u2013...)\n* Christopher I Damiata (797\u2013810) - ''deposed''<br>John (804) - ''usurper''\n* Christopher II (810\u2013813)\n* Christopher I Damiata (813\u2013...) - ''reinstated''\n* Orso I Parteciacus (825\u2013...)\n* Maurice (...\u2013...)\n* Domenicus I (...\u2013...)\n* John (unknown \u2013 876) - ''excommunicated by [[Pope John VIII]]''\n* Lorenzo I (880\u2013909)\n* Domenico II (909\u2013...)\n* Domenico III (...\u2013...)\n* Peter I Tribunus (929\u2013938)\n* Orso II (938\u2013945)\n* Domenico IV Talonicus (945\u2013955)\n* Peter II Marturio (955\u2013963)\n* George (963\u2013966)\n* [[Marino Cassianico]] (966\u2013992)\n* Domenico V Gradenigo (992\u20131026)\n* Domenico VI Gradenigo (1026\u20131044)\n* Domenico VII Contarini (1044\u20131074)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Bishops of Castello===\nBishops of Castello were:{{sfn|Titular Episcopal See of Castello: GCatholic}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Henry Contarini]] (1074\u20131108)\n* Vitale I Michiel (1108\u20131120)\n* Bonifacio Falier (1120\u20131133)\n* [[Giovanni Polani|John I Polani]] (1133\u20131164)\n* Vitale II Michiel (1164\u20131182)\n* Philip Casolo (1182\u20131184)\n* Mark I Nicolai (1184\u20131225)\n* Mark II Michiel (1225\u20131235)\n* Peter III Pino (1235\u20131255)\n* Walter Agnusdei (1255\u20131258)\n* Thomas I Arimondo (1258\u20131260)\n* Thomas II Franco (1260\u20131274)\n* Bartolomew I Querini (1274\u20131292)\n* Simeon Moro (1292\u20131293)\n* Bartholomew II Querini (1293\u20131303)\n* Ramberto Polo (1303\u20131311)\n* Galasso Albertini (1311)\n* Giacomo Albertini (1311\u20131329)\n* Angelo I Dolfin (1329\u20131336)\n* Nicholas Morosini (1336\u20131367)\n* [[Paul Foscari]] (1367\u20131375)\n* John II (1375\u20131378) - ''deposed''\n* Nicholas II Morosini (1379)\n* Angelo II Correr (1379\u20131390) - ''became [[Pope Gregory XII]]''\n* John III Loredan (1390)\n* Francis I Falier (1390\u20131392)\n* Leonard Dolfin (1392\u20131401)\n* Francis II Bembo (1401\u20131417)\n* Mark III Lando (1417\u20131426)\n* Peter IV Donato (1426\u20131428)\n* Francis III Malipiero (1428\u20131433)\n* [[Lawrence Giustiniani|Lorenzo II Giustiniani]] (1433\u20131451) - ''became Patriarch of Venice''\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Titular Bishops===\nTitular bishops and archbishops were:{{sfn|Titular Episcopal See of Castello: GCatholic}}\n*Titular Archbishop [[Angel P\u00e9rez Cisneros]] (1969.07.25 \u2013 1972.08.30)\n*Titular Archbishop [[Pierluigi Sartorelli]] (1972.10.07 \u2013 1996.04.28)\n*Titular Bishop:  [[Gianni Danzi]] (later Archbishop) (1996.05.02 \u2013 2005.02.22)\n*Titular Archbishop [[Charles Daniel Balvo]] (from 2005.04.01)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church in Italy]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Notes}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Boito|first=Camillo|title=The Basilica of S.
