During the [[Majapahit]] era, Nusantara was described as vassal areas to be conquered, the overseas possessions of Majapahit, in contrast with ''Negara Agung'' or the core of Majapahit. However, Douwes Dekker did not want this aggressive connotation, so he defined Nusantara as all the Indonesian regions from [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]] as far as [[Merauke]]. Although Douwes Dekker's proposal did not succeed, and the name \"Indonesia\" remained in use for the nation's name, the name \"Nusantara\" has been widely used in literature, printed and broadcast news materials and popular publications, thus it has become the [[synonym]] for Indonesia.\n\n==Poetic literature names==\nSome literature works and poems describe Indonesia in eloquent poetic names, such as ''Zamrud Khatulistiwa'' (\"Emerald of the Equator\"), which refers to Indonesian green and lush [[tropical rainforest]] as the [[emerald]]s, as well as the geographic position of Indonesia, along the [[equator]]. It was coined by [[Multatuli]] (a pen name used by Eduard Douwes Dekker, Ernest Douwes Dekker's granduncle), a 19th-century [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer, who described Dutch East Indies as ''\"'t prachtig ryk van Insulinde dat zich daar slingert om den evenaar, als een gordel van smaragd\"'' (\"the beautiful empire of Insulinde that girdles the equator like a belt of emerald\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11024/pg11024.txt|title=''Multatuli by Max Havelaar (full text)''|publisher=Project Gutenberg|language=Dutch|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther epithets such as ''Bumi Pertiwi'' (\"Land of Pertiwi or [[Earth Mother|Mother Earth]]\"), refer to Indonesia through its [[national personification]], [[Ibu Pertiwi]], and ''Tanah Air'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] lit: \"soil and water\"), an Indonesian word for \"[[homeland]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malay Archipelago]]\n* [[Sunda islands]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Name of}}\n{{Countries and languages lists}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of country names in various languages|Indonesia]]\n[[Category:History of Indonesia]]\n", "name_user": "Feminist", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copying fromCategory:Lists of country names in various languagestoCategory:Country name etymologyThese are suitable for both categories usingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Indonesia"}

The inscription is known as the 'Yadana Kon Htan Inscription'. At present it is in Bagan recorded as stone number 43 in the Archaeological Department's collection.<ref>Ma Thanegi (2011), p. 97.</ref>\n\nToday in Burmese the name is still spelled ''Mranma'', but over time the \"r\" sound disappeared in most dialects of the Burmese language and was replaced by a \"y\" glide, so although the name is spelled \"Mranma\", it is actually pronounced ''Myanma''.\n\nIn the decades preceding independence, independence parties were in search of a name for the new country to be born, which would be made up not only of Burmese-speaking people, but also of many minorities. In the 1920s, some favoured the name ''Myanma'', which had been the name applied to the old Burmese kingdom subjugated by the British in the 19th century. In the 1930s, the left-wing independence parties favoured the name ''Bama'', as they thought this name was more inclusive of minorities than ''Myanma''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe Burmese [[puppet state]] set up by the Japanese occupation forces during the [[Second World War]] was officially called ''[[State of Burma|Bama]]''. When the Japanese used their own syllabary, they transliterated the three consonants of the Dutch name \"Birma\" and ended up with the name Biruma (\u30d3\u30eb\u30de). At the time of independence in 1948, the \"Union of Burma\" was the name that was chosen for the new country, being further amended as the \"Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\" in 1974, following a 1962 [[military coup]].\n\nWhile both the names ''Bama'' and ''Myanma'' historically referred only to the Burmans and not other ethnic minorities, Burmese governments in the post-independence period have instituted a differentiation of meaning between Myanmar and Bamar in the official Burmese language usage. The name Myanma/Myanmar was expanded to include all citizens of the country while the name Bama/Bamar was kept to its original meaning. Both are widespread use in colloquial usage. Most still use Bamar/Myanmar interchangeably, to refer to the country, depending on the context. Ironically, because of the official renaming of the country, the dominant ethnic group is now known by its colloquial name, ''Bamar'', rather than by its literary name, ''Myanmar'' in official Burmese usage.<ref name=\"Ammon\"/>\n\n== English names ==\n\n=== History ===\nIn English, the official name chosen for the country at the time of independence was \"Burma\". This was already the name that the British called their colony before 1948. This name most likely comes from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Birmania''{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=resembles Burmese and Indic names more}} and was adopted by English in the 18th century. The Portuguese name itself came from the Indian name ''Barma'' which was borrowed by the Portuguese from any of the Indian languages in the 16th or 17th century. This Indian name ''Barma'' may derive from colloquial Burmese ''Bama'', but it may also derive from the Indian name ''Brahma-desh.''\n\nEarly usage of the English term Burma varies:\n* Bermah (Earliest European maps as old as the 18th century spelled Burma with an 'e'.)\n* Birmah (Charles Thomson map of 1827)\n* Brama ([[Thomas Kitchin]]'s map of 1787)\n* Burmah (Samuel Dunn's map 1787)\n* Burma (Keith Johnson's map 1803)\n* Burmah (Eugene William's map, 1883)\n* Burma (Common stable spelling used in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper.)\n\nIn 1989, the military regime of Burma set up a commission in charge of reviewing the place names of Burma in the English language. The aim of the commission was to correct the spelling of the place names of Burma in English, to discard spellings chosen by British colonial authorities in the 19th century, and adopt spellings closer to the actual Burmese pronunciation (compare with [[Renaming of cities in India|what happened in India]] with Calcutta/[[Kolkata]] and Calicut/[[Kozhikode]]). These renamings took the form of the \"Adaptation of Expressions Law\", passed on 18 June 1989. Thus, for instance, Rangoon was changed to [[Yangon]] to reflect the fact that the \"r\" sound is no longer used in Standard Burmese and merged with a \"y\" glide.<ref name=\"Houtman1999\">{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV3shLzx0B4C&pg=PA45\n|title=Mental culture in Burmese crisis politics\n|last=Houtman\n|first=Gustaaf\n|year=1999\n|series=ILCAA Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa Monograph Series No. 33\n|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa\n|pages=43\u201354\n|isbn=978-4-87297-748-6}}</ref>\n\nAs for the country's name, the commission decided to replace the English name \"Burma\" with \"Myanmar\", for three reasons. First, ''Myanma'' is the official name of the country in the Burmese language, and the aim of the commission was to have English place names aligned with Burmese place names and pronunciation. Second, the commission thought that the name ''Myanma'' was more inclusive of minorities than the name ''Bama'', and wanted the English name of the country to reflect this. Finally, the military regime has long been suspicious{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} of the colloquial Burmese language, which it perceives as subversive; the English name \"Burma\" mirrors the colloquial Burmese name ''Bama''.\n\nThe final \"r\" in the English \"Myanmar\" is absent in Burmese ''Myanma'' (much as the medial \"r\" in \"Burma\" is absent in standard Burmese ''Bama''). The commission added a final \"r\" in English to represent the low tone of Burmese, in which the word ''Myanma'' is pronounced. In the low tone, the final vowel \"a\" is lengthened. The commission was influenced by [[Received Pronunciation]] and other [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] [[English English]] dialects, in which \"ar\" (without a following vowel) is also pronounced as long \"a\" (often given as \"ah\" in American English). However, in variants of English in which final \"r\" is pronounced, such as standard American English, adding this final \"r\" leads to a pronunciation very different from the Burmese pronunciation.\n\n=== Controversies ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}In the Burmese language, there have been controversies about the name of the country since the 1930s, and the decision of the regime in 1989 carried the controversy into the English language. The regime believes that ''Myanma'' is more inclusive of minorities than ''Bama'', while opponents point out that historically, ''Myanma'' is only a more literary version of ''Bama''.\n\nQuite the opposite of being more inclusive, opposition parties and human rights groups contend that the new English name \"Myanmar\" is actually disrespectful of the minorities of Burma. Minorities, many of whom do not speak Burmese, had become accustomed to the English name \"Burma\" over the years, and they perceive the new name \"Myanmar\" as a purely Burmese name reflecting the policy of domination of the ethnic Burman majority over the minorities.\n\nThe regime changed the name of the country in English; it did not change the official name of the country in Burmese. Former opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] at first opposed the new name \"Myanmar\", pointing out the hypocritical justification of inclusivity put forward by the regime. Opposition parties, although they oppose the English name \"Myanmar\", do not oppose the official Burmese name ''Myanma'', and no opposition party is proposing to use the colloquial name ''Bama'' as the official name of the country.\n\nFinally, a lot of criticism also focused on the lack of linguistic soundness of the reform. Only four language scholars sat in the 1989 commission, while the majority of the commission was made up of military officials and civil servants with no particular knowledge of linguistics. The new names adopted often lacked serious linguistic credibility, and some appear questionable (the final \"r\" at the end of the name Myanmar makes sense only for a speaker of a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic dialect]] of English).\n\n==== Adoption ====\nSince the 1989 decision to change the English name from \"Burma\" to \"Myanmar\", adoption of the new name in the English-speaking world has been mixed.

Thus we find both \"Myanma Airways\" (correct spelling) and \"Myanmar Airways\" (incorrect spelling, but used officially and recognised anyway). Some English speakers have even coined the adjective \"Myanmarese\" or \"Myanmese\", to follow English rather than Burmese grammatical rules. These adjectives are not recommended as most natives of Myanmar preferred to be called either the old way of \"Burmese\", \"Myanmar\", or \"Myanma\" representing the many diverse races in the country.\n\nAccording to the renaming, the name of the dominant ethnicity of Burma, whose people speak the Burmese language, is \"Bamar\" (again, final \"r\" only added to denote a long \"a\" in Burmese). Thus, ''Myanmar'' is a country inhabited by the ''Bamars'' plus many minorities; and the ''Bamars'' and minorities are collectively known as ''Myanma'' people.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nWhile use of the name \"Myanmar\" is widespread and rivals the use of \"Burma\", adoption of adjectival forms has been far more limited; in general, terms in use before 1989 have persisted. Citizens of Burma, regardless their ethnicity, are known as \"Burmese\", while the dominant ethnicity is called \"Burman\". The language of the Burmans, however, is known as the Burmese language, not as the Burman language, although confusingly enough the \"Burmese\" language is considered one of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-\"Burman\" languages]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Other languages==\nIn [[Assamese language|Assamese]] the country is known as \u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 (Maan dex) since the time when the 1st [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Sukapha]] crossed Patkai hills to come to Assam valley from Myanmar. The period of Burmese invasions to Assam are known as \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09f0 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8 (Maanor din) ie Days of Maan.\n\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the name appeared for the first time in 1273 and was recorded as \u7dec (pronounced \"Mi\u01cen\" in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]).<ref name=dgeh/> The present name in the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] is \u7dec\u7538 (pronounced Mi\u01cendi\u00e0n). The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (''Mi\u1ebfn \u0110i\u1ec7n'') is derived from the same term.\n\nIn Japan, although the Japanese government's basic position is to use {{nihongo|''Myanm\u0101''|\u30df\u30e3\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}, often media organisations indicate {{nihongo|''Biruma''|\u30d3\u30eb\u30de}} in parentheses afterwards. ''Biruma'' may be used more often in the spoken language, while ''Myanm\u0101'' is more common in written language. Popular Japanese fictional works such as ''[[The Burmese Harp (1985 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (''Biruma no tategoto'') mean that the name ''Biruma'' may have more of an emotional resonance to readers.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://business.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/opinion/20120131/226722/?rt=nocnt |last=Kumano|first=Shin'ichir\u014d |date=6 February 2012 |title=\u30df\u30e3\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3001\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u640d\u306f\u306a\u30446\u306e\u30ad\u30db\u30f3| periodical=Nikkei Business Weekly |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> Historically Japan used the Chinese characters of \"Menden\" (\u7dec\u7538) to refer to Burma.

As such, some groups\u2014particularly non-Bamar minorities\u2014consider one or other (or indeed both) names to be exclusionary.\n\n=== \"Bama\" ===\nThe colloquial name ''Bama'' is supposed to have originated from the name ''Myanma'' by shortening of the first syllable, from loss of nasal final \"an\" ({{IPA|/-\u00e0\u0274/}}), reduced to non-nasal \"a\" ({{IPA|/-\u00e0/}}), and loss of \"y\" ({{IPA|/-j-/}}) [[semivowel|glide]]), and then by transformation of \"m\" into \"b\".

In the 1920s, some favoured the name ''Myanma'', which had been the name applied to the old Burmese kingdom subjugated by the British in the 19th century. In the 1930s, the left-wing independence parties favoured the name ''Bama'', as they thought this name was more inclusive of minorities than ''Myanma''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe Burmese [[puppet state]] set up by the Japanese occupation forces during the [[Second World War]] was officially called ''[[State of Burma|Bama]]''. When the Japanese used their own syllabary, they transliterated the three consonants of the Dutch name \"Birma\" and ended up with the name Biruma (\u30d3\u30eb\u30de). At the time of independence in 1948, the \"Union of Burma\" was the name that was chosen for the new country, being further amended as the \"Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\" in 1974, following a 1962 [[military coup]].\n\nWhile both the names ''Bama'' and ''Myanma'' historically referred only to the Burmans and not other ethnic minorities, Burmese governments in the post-independence period have instituted a differentiation of meaning between Myanmar and Bamar in the official Burmese language usage. The name Myanma/Myanmar was expanded to include all citizens of the country while the name Bama/Bamar was kept to its original meaning. Both are widespread use in colloquial usage. Most still use Bamar/Myanmar interchangeably, to refer to the country, depending on the context. Ironically, because of the official renaming of the country, the dominant ethnic group is now known by its colloquial name, ''Bamar'', rather than by its literary name, ''Myanmar'' in official Burmese usage.<ref name=\"Ammon\"/>\n\n== English names ==\n\n=== History ===\nIn English, the official name chosen for the country at the time of independence was \"Burma\". This was already the name that the British called their colony before 1948. This name most likely comes from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Birmania''{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=resembles Burmese and Indic names more}} and was adopted by English in the 18th century. The Portuguese name itself came from the Indian name ''Barma'' which was borrowed by the Portuguese from any of the Indian languages in the 16th or 17th century. This Indian name ''Barma'' may derive from colloquial Burmese ''Bama'', but it may also derive from the Indian name ''Brahma-desh.''\n\nEarly usage of the English term Burma varies:\n* Bermah (Earliest European maps as old as the 18th century spelled Burma with an 'e'.)\n* Birmah (Charles Thomson map of 1827)\n* Brama ([[Thomas Kitchin]]'s map of 1787)\n* Burmah (Samuel Dunn's map 1787)\n* Burma (Keith Johnson's map 1803)\n* Burmah (Eugene William's map, 1883)\n* Burma (Common stable spelling used in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper.)\n\nIn 1989, the military regime of Burma set up a commission in charge of reviewing the place names of Burma in the English language. The aim of the commission was to correct the spelling of the place names of Burma in English, to discard spellings chosen by British colonial authorities in the 19th century, and adopt spellings closer to the actual Burmese pronunciation (compare with [[Renaming of cities in India|what happened in India]] with Calcutta/[[Kolkata]] and Calicut/[[Kozhikode]]). These renamings took the form of the \"Adaptation of Expressions Law\", passed on 18 June 1989. Thus, for instance, Rangoon was changed to [[Yangon]] to reflect the fact that the \"r\" sound is no longer used in Standard Burmese and merged with a \"y\" glide.<ref name=\"Houtman1999\">{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV3shLzx0B4C&pg=PA45\n|title=Mental culture in Burmese crisis politics\n|last=Houtman\n|first=Gustaaf\n|year=1999\n|series=ILCAA Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa Monograph Series No. 33\n|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa\n|pages=43\u201354\n|isbn=978-4-87297-748-6}}</ref>\n\nAs for the country's name, the commission decided to replace the English name \"Burma\" with \"Myanmar\", for three reasons. First, ''Myanma'' is the official name of the country in the Burmese language, and the aim of the commission was to have English place names aligned with Burmese place names and pronunciation. Second, the commission thought that the name ''Myanma'' was more inclusive of minorities than the name ''Bama'', and wanted the English name of the country to reflect this. Finally, the military regime has long been suspicious{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} of the colloquial Burmese language, which it perceives as subversive; the English name \"Burma\" mirrors the colloquial Burmese name ''Bama''.\n\nThe final \"r\" in the English \"Myanmar\" is absent in Burmese ''Myanma'' (much as the medial \"r\" in \"Burma\" is absent in standard Burmese ''Bama''). The commission added a final \"r\" in English to represent the low tone of Burmese, in which the word ''Myanma'' is pronounced. In the low tone, the final vowel \"a\" is lengthened. The commission was influenced by [[Received Pronunciation]] and other [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] [[English English]] dialects, in which \"ar\" (without a following vowel) is also pronounced as long \"a\" (often given as \"ah\" in American English). However, in variants of English in which final \"r\" is pronounced, such as standard American English, adding this final \"r\" leads to a pronunciation very different from the Burmese pronunciation.\n\n=== Controversies ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}In the Burmese language, there have been controversies about the name of the country since the 1930s, and the decision of the regime in 1989 carried the controversy into the English language. The regime believes that ''Myanma'' is more inclusive of minorities than ''Bama'', while opponents point out that historically, ''Myanma'' is only a more literary version of ''Bama''.\n\nQuite the opposite of being more inclusive, opposition parties and human rights groups contend that the new English name \"Myanmar\" is actually disrespectful of the minorities of Burma. Minorities, many of whom do not speak Burmese, had become accustomed to the English name \"Burma\" over the years, and they perceive the new name \"Myanmar\" as a purely Burmese name reflecting the policy of domination of the ethnic Burman majority over the minorities.\n\nThe regime changed the name of the country in English; it did not change the official name of the country in Burmese. Former opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] at first opposed the new name \"Myanmar\", pointing out the hypocritical justification of inclusivity put forward by the regime. Opposition parties, although they oppose the English name \"Myanmar\", do not oppose the official Burmese name ''Myanma'', and no opposition party is proposing to use the colloquial name ''Bama'' as the official name of the country.\n\nFinally, a lot of criticism also focused on the lack of linguistic soundness of the reform. Only four language scholars sat in the 1989 commission, while the majority of the commission was made up of military officials and civil servants with no particular knowledge of linguistics. The new names adopted often lacked serious linguistic credibility, and some appear questionable (the final \"r\" at the end of the name Myanmar makes sense only for a speaker of a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic dialect]] of English).\n\n==== Adoption ====\nSince the 1989 decision to change the English name from \"Burma\" to \"Myanmar\", adoption of the new name in the English-speaking world has been mixed. Use of \"Burma\" has remained widespread, largely based on the question of whether the regime has the legitimacy to change the country's name, particularly without a [[referendum]].<ref name=\"Houtman1999\" />\n\nThe [[United Nations]], of which Myanmar is a member, endorsed the name change five days after its announcement.<ref name=\"Scrivener\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/264116\n|title=The Burma question\n|last=Scrivener\n|first=Leslie\n|date=6 October 2007\n|work=TheStar.com}}</ref> However, the [[United States]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mm.usembassy.gov/|title=U.S. Embassy in Burma|website=U.S. Embassy in Burma|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> and the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-rangoon|title=British Embassy Rangoon - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> still refer to the country as \"Burma\".

However, the matter has resurfaced, as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) reverted to the former title under Abbott's leadership in late 2013. A reason for the change has not appeared in the media, but, as of June 2014, the Abbott government's policy advises officials to switch between Burma and Myanmar, in accordance with the circumstances at hand.

Thus we find both \"Myanma Airways\" (correct spelling) and \"Myanmar Airways\" (incorrect spelling, but used officially and recognised anyway). Some English speakers have even coined the adjective \"Myanmarese\" or \"Myanmese\", to follow English rather than Burmese grammatical rules. These adjectives are not recommended as most natives of Myanmar preferred to be called either the old way of \"Burmese\", \"Myanmar\", or \"Myanma\" representing the many diverse races in the country.\n\nAccording to the renaming, the name of the dominant ethnicity of Burma, whose people speak the Burmese language, is \"Bamar\" (again, final \"r\" only added to denote a long \"a\" in Burmese). Thus, ''Myanmar'' is a country inhabited by the ''Bamars'' plus many minorities; and the ''Bamars'' and minorities are collectively known as ''Myanma'' people.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nWhile use of the name \"Myanmar\" is widespread and rivals the use of \"Burma\", adoption of adjectival forms has been far more limited; in general, terms in use before 1989 have persisted. Citizens of Burma, regardless their ethnicity, are known as \"Burmese\", while the dominant ethnicity is called \"Burman\". The language of the Burmans, however, is known as the Burmese language, not as the Burman language, although confusingly enough the \"Burmese\" language is considered one of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-\"Burman\" languages]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Other languages==\nIn [[Assamese language|Assamese]] the country is known as \u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 (Maan dex) since the time when the 1st [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Sukapha]] crossed Patkai hills to come to Assam valley from Myanmar.

The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (''Mi\u1ebfn \u0110i\u1ec7n'') is derived from the same term.\n\nIn Japan, although the Japanese government's basic position is to use {{nihongo|''Myanm\u0101''|\u30df\u30e3\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}, often media organisations indicate {{nihongo|''Biruma''|\u30d3\u30eb\u30de}} in parentheses afterwards. ''Biruma'' may be used more often in the spoken language, while ''Myanm\u0101'' is more common in written language.

The word \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam\", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by [[Nguy\u1ec5n B\u1ec9nh Khi\u00eam]]. \"Annam\", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer [[Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u]] revived the name \"Vietnam\" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, \"Vietnam.\" However, \"Viet Nam\" was once common usage and is still used by the [[United Nations]] and by the Vietnamese government.\n\nThroughout history, there were many names used to refer to Vietnam. Besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to territory of Vietnam.

Under [[British Ceylon|British rule]], the island was known as '''Ceylon''' from 1815 to 1972.\n\n==''Lanka''==\nThe word ''Lanka'' simply means any island. It is still widely used by the aborigines of Central and Eastern India to mean an island and especially an islet in a river. The word is considered as belonging to [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-asiatic]] languages. The [[Vedda people|Veddas]], the aborigines of Sri Lanka who are Austro-Asiatic in origin, might have rendered the name ''Lanka'' to the island. As it is the biggest island in the South Asian context, ''Lanka'' probably became an exclusive term for it.\n\n''Lak-vaesiyaa'' in Sinhala means an inhabitant of the island of Lanka. ''Lak-diva'' in E'lu (old Sinhala) means the island of Lanka.
