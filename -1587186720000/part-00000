It began on 1 July 1988 and concluded on 30 June 1989, with competitive matches played between August and May. The club ended its 18-year wait for the league title by winning the [[Football League First Division]] championship in the most closely fought title race in the competition's history. Arsenal beat [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2\u20130 in the [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|final match of the season]] to take the title on goals scored, as both clubs shared the same points total and goal difference. During the season Arsenal also enjoyed success in the [[Football League Centenary Trophy]], but exited the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] to Liverpool in the third round and fell at the same stage of the [[FA Cup]] to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nEarlier in the year manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] had started to assemble a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders [[Steve Bould]] and [[Lee Dixon]], he set about trimming the squad letting [[Steve Williams (footballer, born 1958)|Steve Williams]] and [[Kenny Sansom]] leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title at the start of the season, but a 5\u20131 win away at [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed.

It began on 1 July 1988 and concluded on 30 June 1989, with competitive matches played between August and May. The club ended its 18-year wait for the league title by winning the [[Football League First Division]] championship in the most closely fought title race in the competition's history. Arsenal beat [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2\u20130 in the [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|final match of the season]] to take the title on goals scored, as both clubs shared the same points total and goal difference. During the season Arsenal also enjoyed success in the [[Football League Centenary Trophy]], but exited the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] to Liverpool in the third round and fell at the same stage of the [[FA Cup]] to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nEarlier in the year manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] had started to assemble a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders [[Steve Bould]] and [[Lee Dixon]], he set about trimming the squad letting [[Steve Williams (footballer, born 1958)|Steve Williams]] and [[Kenny Sansom]] leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title at the start of the season, but a 5\u20131 win away at [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge \u2013 winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into [[Association football#Duration and tie-breaking methods|stoppage time]] midfielder [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] scored the all-important second goal.\n\n17 different players represented Arsenal in four competitions and there were 14 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer was [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1962)|Alan Smith]], who scored 25 goals in 46 appearances. Smith and [[David Rocastle]] were the only Arsenal representatives in the [[PFA Team of the Year (1980s)#1988.E2.80.9389|PFA Team of the Year]]. Forward [[Paul Merson]] was named the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]], an award voted for by his fellow peers.

Rev.

Multiple events happened at Guild's frame structure, including the first marriage in the city, one that involved his daughter Harriet Guild and Barney Burton, as well as the first town meeting that had nine voters. It was also this year Campau began constructing his own frame building\u2014the largest at the time\u2014near present-day Rosa Parks Circle.<ref name=\"HISTORY1870\"/>\n\nIn 1835, many settlers arrived in the area with the population growing to about 50 people, including its first doctor, Dr. Wilson, who was supplied with equipment from Campau.<ref name=\"HISTORY1870\"/> [[Lucius Lyon]], a Yankee Protestant who would later become a rival to Campau arrived in Grand Rapids who purchased the rest of the prime land and called his plot the Village of Kent. When Lyon and his partner N. O. Sergeant returned after their purchase, they arrived along with a posse of men carrying shovels and picks, with the goal of building a [[mill race]]. The posse arrived to the music of a bugle, startling the settlement with Chief Noonday offering Campau assistance to drive back Lyon's posse believing they were invaders. Also that year, Rev. Andrew Vizoisky, a Hungarian native educated in Catholic institutions in Austria, arrived, presiding over the Catholic mission in the area until his death in 1852.<ref name=\"HISTORY1870\"/>\n\nThat year, Campau, Rix Robinson, Rev. Slater and the husband of Chief Noonday's daughter, Meccissininni, traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak about the purchase of Ottawa land on the west side of the river with President [[Andrew Jackson]].<ref name=\"HISTORY1881\"/> Jackson was originally unimpressed with Meccissininni, though Meccissininni, who often acquired white customs, asked Jackson for a similar suit to the one the president was wearing.

Rev. Turner had established a school on the east side of the river, with children on the west side of the river being brought to school every morning by a Native American on a canoe who would shuttle them across the river. Multiple events happened at Guild's frame structure, including the first marriage in the city, one that involved his daughter Harriet Guild and Barney Burton, as well as the first town meeting that had nine voters. It was also this year Campau began constructing his own frame building\u2014the largest at the time\u2014near present-day Rosa Parks Circle.<ref name=\"HISTORY1870\"/>\n\nIn 1835, many settlers arrived in the area with the population growing to about 50 people, including its first doctor, Dr. Wilson, who was supplied with equipment from Campau.<ref name=\"HISTORY1870\"/> [[Lucius Lyon]], a Yankee Protestant who would later become a rival to Campau arrived in Grand Rapids who purchased the rest of the prime land and called his plot the Village of Kent. When Lyon and his partner N. O. Sergeant returned after their purchase, they arrived along with a posse of men carrying shovels and picks, with the goal of building a [[mill race]]. The posse arrived to the music of a bugle, startling the settlement with Chief Noonday offering Campau assistance to drive back Lyon's posse believing they were invaders. Also that year, Rev. Andrew Vizoisky, a Hungarian native educated in Catholic institutions in Austria, arrived, presiding over the Catholic mission in the area until his death in 1852.<ref name=\"HISTORY1870\"/>\n\nThat year, Campau, Rix Robinson, Rev. Slater and the husband of Chief Noonday's daughter, Meccissininni, traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak about the purchase of Ottawa land on the west side of the river with President [[Andrew Jackson]].<ref name=\"HISTORY1881\"/> Jackson was originally unimpressed with Meccissininni, though Meccissininni, who often acquired white customs, asked Jackson for a similar suit to the one the president was wearing. While later wearing his suit that was made similar to Jackson's, Meccissininni also unknowingly imitated Jackson's hat, placing a piece of weed in it, which impressed Jackson since it symbolized mourning the death of his wife.<ref name=\"HISTORY1881\"/>\n\n[[John Ball (pioneer)|John Ball]], representing a group of New York land speculators, bypassed Detroit for a better deal in Grand Rapids traveling to the settlement in 1836.
