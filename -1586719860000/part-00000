Vision was formed in the months leading up to the [[2005 Vancouver municipal election|2005 municipal election]].\n\n== Formation ==\nA [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] civic party, Vision was founded by former [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE) members first elected to Vancouver City Council in 2002. Following that election, [[Mayor]] [[Larry Campbell]] and Councillors [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]], [[Raymond Louie]] and [[Tim Stevenson]] were dubbed \"COPE Light\" by the local media due to their moderate positions on taxation and development, as opposed to the more leftist \"COPE Classic\" Councillors.\n\nOngoing disagreements between the two factions led to Campbell and his allies forming an independent COPE caucus in December 2004. At the same time, supporters of Campbell and his allies created a fundraising organization independent of COPE called \"Friends of Larry Campbell\".\n\nThis group and its backers eventually formed a new party called \"Vision Vancouver\", initially to be led by Campbell. However, when Campbell announced that he would not seek a second term as mayor, he called on Jim Green to run to succeed him. The party decided in August 2005 to run only five of a possible ten Council candidates and did not contest school board and park board slate elections.\n\nIn the November 2005 election for Vancouver City Council, four Vision Vancouver candidates ([[Raymond Louie]], [[Tim Stevenson]], [[Heather Deal]] and [[George Chow]]) were elected, but the party's mayoral candidate, Jim Green, was defeated by the [[Non-Partisan Association]]'s (NPA) [[Sam Sullivan]]. Six members of the Non-Partisan Association were elected along with one for COPE.\n\n== In power (2008\u20132018) ==\n{{POV section|date=November 2017}}\n\nFor the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election|November 2008 election]], Vision was seen as a serious contender for control of the city due to the perceived unpopularity of the [[Sam Sullivan]] [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA) team.{{by whom|date=April 2020}} On [[Father's Day]], June 2008 Vision held an election to nominate their mayoral candidate. The choices were [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]] (a local \"green\" businessman, owner of the [[Happy Planet]] juice company and a [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] for [[Vancouver-Fairview]]), [[Raymond Louie]] (serving Vision city councillor), and Allan De Genova (Independent [[Vancouver Park Board]] Commissioner who defected from the NPA because of his dislike of Sullivan's leadership). The original dynamic for this contest shifted when the NPA voted to change their mayoral candidate, replacing the incumbent Sullivan with longtime Councillor and businessman (editor of ''[[Business in Vancouver]]'' newspaper) Peter Ladner. Gregor Robertson was nominated to be Vision's mayoral candidate in 2008 despite his perceived similarity to the rival NPA's candidate.\n\nUnder the direction of mayoral candidate Gregor Robertson, Vision Vancouver responded to COPE's requests (dating back to a change in leadership at COPE in May 2007) to negotiate an electoral coalition with COPE and the [[Green Party of Vancouver]] (who ran joint slates with COPE in previous years). Vision Vancouver, COPE and the Greens agreed to support Gregor Robertson as mayor, run uncompeting slates and coordinate other elements of the election.\n\nOn November 15, 2008, Gregor Robertson was elected mayor of Vancouver and the Vision\u2013COPE\u2013Green coalition came to power. The only Vision Vancouver candidate that was not elected was Kashmir Dhalliwal.\n\nIn the [[2011 Vancouver municipal election]], held on November 19, Gregor Robertson was re-elected mayor of Vancouver. All Vision Vancouver candidates were elected.\n\nIn the [[2014 Vancouver municipal election|2014 election]], held on November 15, Gregor Robertson was re-elected mayor of Vancouver. The slate also retained its majority on city council, the School Board, and the Park Board. In 2017, Vision lost one seat on council in [[2017 Vancouver municipal by-election|a by-election]] to [[Hector Bremner]] of the NPA.\n\nVision ran a slate of candidates in the [[2018 Vancouver municipal election|2018 election]], including [[Heather Deal]], Catherine Evans, Diego Cardona, Tanya Paz and Wei Qiao Zhang, for city council.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-council-candidates-1.4770924 |title=A Vancouver voter's guide to city council's crowded ballot |first=Justin |last=McElroy |work=[[CBC News]] |date=August 2, 2018|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}</ref> [[Ian Campbell (Canadian politician)|Ian Campbell]] was intended to be the slate's mayoral candidate,<ref>{{cite web |last=Green |first=Melanie |title=Squamish Nation chief enters the mayoral race |url=https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2018/05/14/squamish-nation-chief-enters-the-mayoral-race.html |date=May 14, 2018 |accessdate=August 20, 2018 |work=[[StarMetro (newspaper)|StarMetro Vancouver]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/squamish-chief-ian-campbell-puts-name-forward-for-vision-vancouver-mayoral-candidacy-1.4661485 |title=Squamish chief Ian Campbell puts name forward for Vision Vancouver mayoral candidacy |first=Maryse |last=Zeidler |work=[[CBC News]] |date=May 14, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref> but several days before nominations were due, he withdrew from the race.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fumano |first1=Dan |first2=Cheryl |last2=Chan |title=Vision candidate Ian Campbell withdraws from race for mayor of Vancouver |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vision-candidate-ian-campbell-withdraws-from-race-for-mayor-of-vancouver |date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |work=[[Vancouver Sun]]}}</ref> The election resulted in Vision losing their majority on all three elected bodies and losing all but one race, for a seat on the Vancouver School Board which was held by incumbent Allan Wong.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Charlie |title=Vision Vancouver trustee Allan Wong wants school board to support student participation in upcoming climate strike |url=https://www.straight.com/news/1305461/vision-vancouver-trustee-allan-wong-wants-school-board-support-student-participation |accessdate=April 8, 2020 |work=The Georgia Straight |date=September 23, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Electoral results ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Mayoral\n!

Vision was formed in the months leading up to the [[2005 Vancouver municipal election|2005 municipal election]].\n\n== Formation ==\nA [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] civic party, Vision was founded by former [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE) members first elected to Vancouver City Council in 2002. Following that election, [[Mayor]] [[Larry Campbell]] and Councillors [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]], [[Raymond Louie]] and [[Tim Stevenson]] were dubbed \"COPE Light\" by the local media due to their moderate positions on taxation and development, as opposed to the more leftist \"COPE Classic\" Councillors.\n\nOngoing disagreements between the two factions led to Campbell and his allies forming an independent COPE caucus in December 2004. At the same time, supporters of Campbell and his allies created a fundraising organization independent of COPE called \"Friends of Larry Campbell\".\n\nThis group and its backers eventually formed a new party called \"Vision Vancouver\", initially to be led by Campbell. However, when Campbell announced that he would not seek a second term as mayor, he called on Jim Green to run to succeed him. The party decided in August 2005 to run only five of a possible ten Council candidates and did not contest school board and park board slate elections.\n\nIn the November 2005 election for Vancouver City Council, four Vision Vancouver candidates ([[Raymond Louie]], [[Tim Stevenson]], [[Heather Deal]] and [[George Chow]]) were elected, but the party's mayoral candidate, Jim Green, was defeated by the [[Non-Partisan Association]]'s (NPA) [[Sam Sullivan]]. Six members of the Non-Partisan Association were elected along with one for COPE.\n\n== In power (2008\u20132018) ==\n{{POV section|date=November 2017}}\n\nFor the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election|November 2008 election]], Vision was seen as a serious contender for control of the city due to the perceived unpopularity of the [[Sam Sullivan]] [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA) team.{{by whom|date=April 2020}} On [[Father's Day]], June 2008 Vision held an election to nominate their mayoral candidate. The choices were [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]] (a local \"green\" businessman, owner of the [[Happy Planet]] juice company and a [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] for [[Vancouver-Fairview]]), [[Raymond Louie]] (serving Vision city councillor), and Allan De Genova (Independent [[Vancouver Park Board]] Commissioner who defected from the NPA because of his dislike of Sullivan's leadership). The original dynamic for this contest shifted when the NPA voted to change their mayoral candidate, replacing the incumbent Sullivan with longtime Councillor and businessman (editor of ''[[Business in Vancouver]]'' newspaper) Peter Ladner. Gregor Robertson was nominated to be Vision's mayoral candidate in 2008 despite his perceived similarity to the rival NPA's candidate.\n\nUnder the direction of mayoral candidate Gregor Robertson, Vision Vancouver responded to COPE's requests (dating back to a change in leadership at COPE in May 2007) to negotiate an electoral coalition with COPE and the [[Green Party of Vancouver]] (who ran joint slates with COPE in previous years). Vision Vancouver, COPE and the Greens agreed to support Gregor Robertson as mayor, run uncompeting slates and coordinate other elements of the election.\n\nOn November 15, 2008, Gregor Robertson was elected mayor of Vancouver and the Vision\u2013COPE\u2013Green coalition came to power. The only Vision Vancouver candidate that was not elected was Kashmir Dhalliwal.\n\nIn the [[2011 Vancouver municipal election]], held on November 19, Gregor Robertson was re-elected mayor of Vancouver. All Vision Vancouver candidates were elected.\n\nIn the [[2014 Vancouver municipal election|2014 election]], held on November 15, Gregor Robertson was re-elected mayor of Vancouver. The slate also retained its majority on city council, the School Board, and the Park Board. In 2017, Vision lost one seat on council in [[2017 Vancouver municipal by-election|a by-election]] to [[Hector Bremner]] of the NPA.\n\nVision ran a slate of candidates in the [[2018 Vancouver municipal election|2018 election]], including [[Heather Deal]], Catherine Evans, Diego Cardona, Tanya Paz and Wei Qiao Zhang, for city council.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-council-candidates-1.4770924 |title=A Vancouver voter's guide to city council's crowded ballot |first=Justin |last=McElroy |work=[[CBC News]] |date=August 2, 2018|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}</ref> [[Ian Campbell (Canadian politician)|Ian Campbell]] was intended to be the slate's mayoral candidate,<ref>{{cite web |last=Green |first=Melanie |title=Squamish Nation chief enters the mayoral race |url=https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2018/05/14/squamish-nation-chief-enters-the-mayoral-race.html |date=May 14, 2018 |accessdate=August 20, 2018 |work=[[StarMetro (newspaper)|StarMetro Vancouver]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/squamish-chief-ian-campbell-puts-name-forward-for-vision-vancouver-mayoral-candidacy-1.4661485 |title=Squamish chief Ian Campbell puts name forward for Vision Vancouver mayoral candidacy |first=Maryse |last=Zeidler |work=[[CBC News]] |date=May 14, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref> but several days before nominations were due, he withdrew from the race.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fumano |first1=Dan |first2=Cheryl |last2=Chan |title=Vision candidate Ian Campbell withdraws from race for mayor of Vancouver |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vision-candidate-ian-campbell-withdraws-from-race-for-mayor-of-vancouver |date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |work=[[Vancouver Sun]]}}</ref> The election resulted in Vision losing their majority on all three elected bodies and losing all but one race, for a seat on the Vancouver School Board which was held by incumbent Allan Wong.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Charlie |title=Vision Vancouver trustee Allan Wong wants school board to support student participation in upcoming climate strike |url=https://www.straight.com/news/1305461/vision-vancouver-trustee-allan-wong-wants-school-board-support-student-participation |accessdate=April 8, 2020 |work=The Georgia Straight |date=September 23, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Electoral results ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Mayoral\n!

Azamgarh is also known as land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur tehsil, near the confluence of Tamsa and Majhuee rivers, {{convert|6|km}} north of the Phulpur.\n\nThe district is named after its headquarters town, Azamgarh, which was founded in 1665 by Azam, son of Vikramajit. Vikramajit was a descendant of [[Gautam Rajput]]s of Mehnagar in pargana Nizamabad who like some of his predecessors had embraced the faith of Islam. He had a Muslim wife who bore him two sons Azam and Azmat. While Azam gave his name to the town of Azamgarh, and the fort, Azmat constructed the fort and settled the bazaar of [[Azmatgarh]] pargana Sagri.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of Name of Azamgarh :|url=http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|accessdate=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627133805/http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=27 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the attack of Chabile Ram, Azmat Khan fled northwards followed by the interior forces. He attempted to cross the [[Ghaghra]] into [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], but the people on the other side opposed his landing, and he was either shot in mid stream or was drowned in attempting to escape by swimming.\n\nIn 1688 A.D. during Azmat's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azam? Or Azmat? --> lifetime, his eldest son Ekram took part in the management of the state, and after Azam's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azmat? Or Azamt? --> death he was perhaps left in possession together with Mohhabat, another son. The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'.\n\nThe successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari. Ikram left no heirs and was succeeded by Iradat, son of Mohhabat. But the real ruler all along had been Mohhabat, and after Ikram's death, he continued to rule in his son's name.\n\n== Geography ==\nAzamgarh has an average elevation of 64&nbsp;metres (209&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Azamgarh.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Azamgarh |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> The district consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Azamgarh|volume=3|page=79}}</ref> The soil is fertile, and very highly cultivated, bearing good crops of rice, sugarcane, and wheat and orchards of mango and guava.

Azamgarh is situated on the bank of [[Tamsa River]] (Tons). It is located {{cvt|268|km}} east of the state capital [[Lucknow]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\nAzamgarh, one of the easternmost districts(district in [[Purvanchal]] sub region) of [[Uttar Pradesh]], once formed a part of the ancient [[Kosala]] kingdom, except its north-eastern part. Azamgarh is also known as land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur tehsil, near the confluence of Tamsa and Majhuee rivers, {{convert|6|km}} north of the Phulpur.\n\nThe district is named after its headquarters town, Azamgarh, which was founded in 1665 by Azam, son of Vikramajit. Vikramajit was a descendant of [[Gautam Rajput]]s of Mehnagar in pargana Nizamabad who like some of his predecessors had embraced the faith of Islam. He had a Muslim wife who bore him two sons Azam and Azmat. While Azam gave his name to the town of Azamgarh, and the fort, Azmat constructed the fort and settled the bazaar of [[Azmatgarh]] pargana Sagri.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of Name of Azamgarh :|url=http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|accessdate=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627133805/http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=27 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the attack of Chabile Ram, Azmat Khan fled northwards followed by the interior forces. He attempted to cross the [[Ghaghra]] into [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], but the people on the other side opposed his landing, and he was either shot in mid stream or was drowned in attempting to escape by swimming.\n\nIn 1688 A.D. during Azmat's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azam? Or Azmat? --> lifetime, his eldest son Ekram took part in the management of the state, and after Azam's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azmat? Or Azamt? --> death he was perhaps left in possession together with Mohhabat, another son. The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'.\n\nThe successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari. Ikram left no heirs and was succeeded by Iradat, son of Mohhabat. But the real ruler all along had been Mohhabat, and after Ikram's death, he continued to rule in his son's name.\n\n== Geography ==\nAzamgarh has an average elevation of 64&nbsp;metres (209&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Azamgarh.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Azamgarh |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> The district consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Azamgarh|volume=3|page=79}}</ref> The soil is fertile, and very highly cultivated, bearing good crops of rice, sugarcane, and wheat and orchards of mango and guava.

His reign saw the last flowering of the [[Komnenian restoration]], during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival.\n\nEager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with the [[Pope Adrian IV|Pope]] and the resurgent [[Latin West|West]]. He invaded the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]], although unsuccessfully, being the last Eastern Roman Emperor to attempt reconquests in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The passage of the potentially dangerous [[Second Crusade]] through his empire was adroitly managed. Manuel [[Manuel I Komnenos#Manuel in Antioch|established a Byzantine protectorate]] over the [[Crusader states]] of [[Outremer]]. Facing [[Muslim]] advances in the [[Holy Land]], he made common cause with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|participated in a combined invasion]] of [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]. Manuel reshaped the political maps of the [[Balkans]] and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and Outremer under Byzantine [[hegemony]] and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east.\n\nHowever, towards the end of his reign Manuel's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at [[Battle of Myriokephalon|Myriokephalon]], which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] position. Although the [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir|Byzantines recovered]] and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]], Myriokephalon proved to be [[Battle of Myriokephalon#Aftermath|the final, unsuccessful effort]] by the empire to recover the interior of [[Anatolia]] from the [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]].\n\nCalled ''ho Megas'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2}}, translated as \"[[the Great]]\") by the [[Greeks]], Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, [[John Kinnamos]], in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of \"the most blessed emperor of [[Constantinople]]\" in parts of the [[Western Christianity|Latin world]] as well.<ref name=\"M3\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3</ref> Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him. Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the [[Komnenos|dynasty]] he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.<ref name=\"M3-4\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3\u20134</ref>\n\n==Accession to the throne==\n[[Image:BN MS FR 2628 Folio134 Comnenus.png|thumb|left|200px|Death of John II Komnenos, and crowning of Manuel I Komnenos (from the Manuscript of [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in [[Acre, Israel]], 13th century, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]).]]\n\nManuel Komnenos was the fourth son of [[John II Komnenos]] and [[Piroska of Hungary]], so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father.<ref name = \"Stone\"/> His maternal grandfather was [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. Ladislaus]]. Having distinguished himself in his father's war against the Seljuk Turks, in 1143 Manuel was chosen as his successor by John, in preference to his elder surviving brother [[Isaac Komnenos (son of John II)|Isaac]]. After John died on 8 April 1143, his son, Manuel, was acclaimed emperor by the armies.<ref name=\"Gib72\">Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72</ref> Yet his succession was by no means assured: At his father's deathbed in the wilds of [[Cilicia]] far from Constantinople, he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible. He still had to take care of his father's funeral, and tradition demanded he organise the foundation of a monastery on the spot where his father died. Swiftly, he dispatched the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[John Axouch]] ahead of him, with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival, his brother Isaac, who was living in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia. Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor's death had reached it. He quickly secured the loyalty of the city, and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143, he was crowned by the new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]], [[Michael II Kourkouas|Michael Kourkouas]]. A few days later, with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure, Manuel ordered the release of Isaac.<ref name=\"NGS\">Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72<br />* J. H. Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium''<br />* A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref> Then he ordered 2 golden pieces to be given to every householder in Constantinople and 200 pounds of gold (including 200 silver pieces annually) to be given to the Byzantine Church.<ref name=\"gold\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 87\u201388</ref>\n\nThe empire that Manuel inherited from his father had undergone great changes since the foundation of Constantinople by [[Constantine I]] eight centuries before. In the time of his predecessor [[Justinian I]] (527\u2013565), parts of the former Western Roman Empire had been recovered including Italy, Africa and part of Spain. However, the empire had diminished greatly following this, the most obvious change had occurred in the 7th century: the soldiers of [[Islam]] had taken [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)#Middle Ages|Palestine]] and much of [[Syria]] away from the empire irrevocably. They had then swept on westwards into what in the time of Constantine had been the western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]], in North Africa and Spain. In the centuries since, the emperors had ruled over a realm that largely consisted of [[Asia Minor]] in the east, and the Balkans in the west.  In the late 11th century the Byzantine Empire entered a period of marked military and political decline, which had been arrested and largely reversed by the leadership of Manuel's grandfather and father. Yet the empire that Manuel inherited was a polity facing formidable challenges. At the end of the 11th century, the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine Emperor. The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central [[Anatolia]]. And in the [[Levant]], a new force had appeared \u2013 the [[Crusader states]] \u2013 which presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges. Now, more than at any time during the preceding centuries, the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed.<ref name=\"PLBr\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantium|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britannica|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==Second Crusade and Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon==\n{{details|Second Crusade}}\n\n===Prince of Antioch===\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The County of Edessa in the context of the other states of the [[Near East]] in 1135]]\nThe first test of Manuel's reign came in 1144, when he was faced with a demand by [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]] for the cession of Cilician territories. However, later that year the crusader [[County of Edessa]] was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic [[jihad]] under [[Imad ad-Din Atabeg Zengi|Imad ad-Din Zengi]]. Raymond realized that immediate help from the west was out of the question.  With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat, there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople. Swallowing his pride, he made the journey north to ask for the protection of the Emperor. After submitting to Manuel, he was promised the support that he had requested, and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured.<ref name=\"M173\">J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 33\u201335<br />* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 40</ref>\n\n===Expedition against Konya===\nIn 1146 Manuel assembled his army at the military base [[Lopadion]] and set out on a [[punitive expedition]] against [[Mesud I|Masud]] the Sultan of [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm|R\u00fbm]], who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western [[Anatolia]] and [[Cilicia]].<ref name=\"Tread640\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 640</ref> There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel's army defeated the Turks at [[Afyonkarahisar|Acro\u00ebnus]], before capturing and destroying the fortified town of [[Philomelion]], removing its remaining Christian population.<ref name=\"Tread640\" /> The Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, [[Konya]], and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls. Among Manuel's motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride.<ref>J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 47<br />* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 42</ref> While on this campaign Manuel received a letter from [[Louis VII of France]] announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states.<ref>Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', p. 42</ref>\n\n===Arrival of the Crusaders===\n[[Image:Arriv\u00e9e des crois\u00e9s \u00e0 Constantinople.jpg|thumb|left|Arrival of the Second Crusade before Constantinople, portrayed in Jean Fouquet's painting from around 1455\u20131460, ''Arriv\u00e9e des crois\u00e9s \u00e0 Constantinople''.]]\n\nManuel was prevented from following up his early successes in the east, for events to the west urgently required his presence in the Balkans. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under [[Conrad III of Germany]] and [[Louis VII of France]]. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the [[First Crusade]], a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel's aunt, [[Anna Komnene]].<ref name=\"AC333\">A. Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', 333</ref>\n\nMany Byzantines feared the Crusade, a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame,  precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution \u2013 which his grandfather had not taken \u2013 of making repairs to the [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]], and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad's army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two.{{Cref|a}} Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos|Kinnamos]] describes a full-scale [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|clash]] between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad's army, outside the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Damalis]] on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.<ref>Kinnamos, pp. 65-67</ref><ref>Birkenmeier, p. 110</ref>\n\nAfter 1147, however, the relations between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law [[Bertha of Sulzbach]] he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against [[Roger II of Sicily]].<ref name=\"M621\">P. Magdalino, ''The Byzantine Empire'', 621</ref> Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]].{{Cref|b}}\n\n===Cyprus invaded===\n[[Image:Image-Manuel-Pope.jpg|thumb|right|Letter by Manuel I Komnenos to [[Pope Eugene III]] on the issue of the crusades ([[Constantinople]], 1146, [[Vatican Secret Archives]]): with this document, the Emperor answers a previous papal letter asking [[Louis VII of France]] to free the [[Holy Land]] and reconquer [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. Manuel answers that he is willing to receive the French army and to support it, but he complains about receiving the letter from an envoy of the [[King of France]] and not from an ambassador sent by the Pope.<ref name=\"Vat\">\n[http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1146.htm Letter by the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202070010/http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1146.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}, Vatican Secret Archives. \n</ref>]]\n\nManuel's attention was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], the new Prince of Antioch, claimed that the Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of [[Cyprus]].<ref name=\"R238\">P. P. Read, ''The Templars'', 238</ref> Raynald arrested the governor of the island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas.<ref name=\"R239\">P. P.

Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.<ref>[[Carole Hillenbrand|C. Hillenbrand]], ''The Imprisonment of Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon'', 80<br />* T. F. Madden, ''The New Concise History of the Crusades'', 65</ref> Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.<ref name=\"R239\" />\n\nManuel responded to this outrage in a characteristically energetic way. In the winter of 1158\u201359, he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Thoros II of Armenia|Thoros of Cilicia]], who had participated in the attack on Cyprus.<ref name=\"M67\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 67</ref> Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.<ref>Jeffreys, Elizabeth; Jeffreys, Michael (2015) \"A Constantinopolitan Poet Views Frankish Antioch\".

''Crusades'', Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-1-472-46841-3}}, vol. 14, p. 53</ref>\n\n===Manuel in Antioch===\nMeanwhile, news of the advance of the [[Komnenian army|Byzantine army]] soon reached Antioch. Realising that he had no hope of defeating Manuel, Raynald also knew that he could not expect any help from king [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]. Baldwin did not approve of Raynald's attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel. Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope. He appeared before the Emperor, dressed in a sack with a rope tied around his neck, and begged for forgiveness. Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were \"disgusted\" by it.<ref>B. Hamilton, ''William of Tyre and the Byzantine Empire'', 226<br />* William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#23 23]</ref> Eventually, Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he would become a vassal of the Empire, effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium.<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\n[[File:Principality of Antioch under byzantine protection.png|thumb|left|Antioch under Byzantine protection (1159\u20131180)]]\n\nPeace having been restored, a grand ceremonial procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding through the streets on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the [[King of Jerusalem]] followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, at the head of a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the ruler of [[Syria]], of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.<ref name=Norwich>Z.

Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration.{{Cref|c}}\n\nSatisfied with his efforts thus far, Manuel headed back to Constantinople. On their way back, his troops were surprised in line of march by the Turks. Despite this, they won a complete victory, routing the enemy army from the field and inflicting heavy losses. In the following year, Manuel drove the Turks out of [[Isauria]].<ref name=\"P121\">K.

However, despite being distracted by a [[Cuman]] attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of [[Conrad III of Germany]], and the help of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent [[George of Antioch]] with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs.<ref name=\"Nor\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 98 and 103</ref> Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy for the rest of his reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.<ref name=\"M621\" />\n\nRoger died in February 1154 and was succeeded by [[William I of Sicily|William I]], who faced widespread rebellions against his rule in [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Apulia]], leading to the presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantine court. Conrad's successor, [[Frederick Barbarossa]], launched a campaign against the Normans, but his expedition stalled. These developments encouraged Manuel to take advantage of the multiple instabilities on the [[Italian peninsula]].<ref name=\"D122\">J. Duggan, ''The Pope and the Princes'', 122</ref> He sent [[Michael Palaiologos (general)|Michael Palaiologos]] and [[John Doukas (megas hetaireiarches)|John Doukas]], both of whom held the high imperial rank of ''[[sebastos]]'', with Byzantine troops, ten ships, and large quantities of gold to invade Apulia in 1155.<ref>J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114<br />* J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 112</ref> The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible.{{Cref|b}} Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons, including Count [[Robert II of Bassunvilla|Robert of Loritello]], Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]] rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown and the untried William I.<ref name=\"M621\" /> There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.<ref name=Norwich />\n\n===Papal-Byzantine alliance===\nThe city of [[Bari]], which had been the capital of the Byzantine [[Catapanate of Italy]] for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its gates to the Emperor's army, and the overjoyed citizens tore down the Norman citadel. After the fall of Bari, the cities of [[Trani]], [[Giovinazzo]], [[Andria]], [[Taranto]], and [[Brindisi]] were also captured. William arrived with his army, including 2,000 knights, but was heavily defeated.<ref name=\"N112-113\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nEncouraged by the success, Manuel dreamed of restoration of the Roman Empire, at the cost of union between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], a prospect which would frequently be offered to the Pope during negotiations and plans for alliance.<ref name=\"Vas7\">[[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|A. A. Vasiliev]], ''History of the Byzantine Empire'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0832/_P1A.HTM VII]</ref> If there was ever a chance of reuniting the eastern and western churches, and coming to reconciliation with the Pope permanently, this was probably the most favourable moment. The [[Papacy]] was never on good terms with the Normans, except when under duress by the threat of direct military action. Having the \"civilised\" Byzantines on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily. It was in the interest of [[Pope Adrian IV]] to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the [[Papal Curia|Curia]].<ref name=\"W18-2\">William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#2 2]</ref> Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.<ref name=\"D122\" />\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Alexios Komnenos and Doukas ... had become captive to the Sicilians' lord [and] again ruined matters.

Byzantine commander Michael Palaiologos alienated allies with his attitude, stalling the campaign as Count [[Robert III of Loritello]] refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign had lost some of its momentum: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople, and his loss was a major blow to the campaign. The turning point was the [[Battle of Brindisi (1156)|Battle of Brindisi]], where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries that had been hired with Manuel's gold demanded huge increases in their pay. When this was refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon John Doukas was left hopelessly outnumbered. The arrival of [[Alexios Komnenos Bryennios]] with some ships failed to retrieve the Byzantine position.{{Cref|d}} The naval battle was decided in favour of the Sicilians, while John Doukas and Alexios Bryennios (along with four Byzantine ships) were captured.<ref name=\"B115\">J.

Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches,{{Cref|e}} hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. [[Pope Adrian IV]] and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other.<ref name=\"Vas7\" /> Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West.<ref>J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114</ref> Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' by the popes. And although he twice sent embassies to [[Pope Alexander III]] (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, Alexander refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.<ref name=\"AGB\">Abb\u00e9 Guett\u00e9e, ''The Papacy'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20040322110754/http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/guettee10.html Chapter VII]<br />* J.

The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 ''hyperpyra'' or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.<ref name=\"B116\">J.

Manuel now decided to oppose the objective of the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty to directly annex Italy, which Frederick believed should acknowledge his power.

Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 131</ref> In all probability, friendly relations between Byzantium and Venice were not restored in Manuel's lifetime.<ref name=\"Vas7\" />\n\n==Balkan frontier==\nOn his northern frontier Manuel expended considerable effort to preserve the conquests made by [[Basil II]] over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the [[Balkan Peninsula|Balkan frontier]], Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]] since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of [[Grand Principality of Ra\u0161ka|Rascia]], being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\n[[Image:Hyperryron-Manuel I-sb1965.jpg|thumb|A ''[[hyperpyron]]'', a form of Byzantine coinage, issued by Manuel.

In the wars of 1151\u20131153 and 1163\u20131168 Manuel led his troops into Hungary and a spectacular raid deep into enemy territory yielded substantial war booty. In 1167, Manuel sent 15,000 men under the command of [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]] against the Hungarians,<ref>J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 241</ref> scoring a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Sirmium]] and enabling the Empire to conclude a very advantageous peace with the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]] by which [[Syrmia]], [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], and [[Dalmatia]] were ceded. By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands.<ref name=\"JWS372\">J. W. Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages'', 372</ref>\n\nEfforts were also made towards a diplomatic annexation of Hungary. The Hungarian heir [[Bela III of Hungary|B\u00e9la]], younger brother of the Hungarian king [[Stephen III of Hungary|Stephen III]], was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the emperor's court. Manuel intended the youth to marry his daughter, [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria]], and to make him his heir, thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire. At court B\u00e9la assumed the name Alexius and received the title of ''[[Despotism|Despot]]'', which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself. However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation. In 1169, Manuel's young wife gave birth to a son, thus depriving B\u00e9la of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary). Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and B\u00e9la went home to take his throne. Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always \"keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans\". B\u00e9la III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary.<ref name=\"JWS372\" />\n\n==Relations with Russia==\nManuel Komnenos attempted to draw the Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, and to a lesser extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince [[Iziaslav II of Kiev]] was related to [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] of [[Suzdal]] was Manuel's ally (''symmachos''), and [[Volodymyrko Volodarovych|Vladimirko]] of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] is described as Manuel's vassal (''hypospondos''). Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over [[Kiev]] and [[Yaroslav Osmomysl|Yaroslav]], the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.<ref>D. Obolensky, ''The Byzantine Commonwealth'', 299\u2013300.</ref>\n\nIn 1164-65 Manuel's cousin [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos]], the future emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and fled to the court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince [[Rostislav I of Kiev|Rostislav]], resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the [[Cuman people|Cumans]].<ref>D. Obolensky, ''The Byzantine Commonwealth'', 300\u2013302.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of relations with Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the [[Walachian Plain]] and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps ([[Southern Carpathians]]), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the [[Sirmium]] and [[Belgrade]] frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of [[Transylvania]] being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.<ref>M.

In the autumn of 1169 Manuel sent a joint expedition with Amalric to Egypt: a Byzantine army and a naval force of 20 large [[warships]], 150 [[galleys]], and 60 [[Horse transports in the Middle Ages|transports]], under the command of the ''[[megas doux]]'' Andronikos Kontostephanos, joined forces with Amalric at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"M74\" /><ref name=\"fleet\">J.

This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that in the context of the wider struggle between the crusader states and the [[Islam]]ic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing [[Fatimid]] [[Caliphate]] of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.<ref name=\"M73\" />\n\nA successful invasion of Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt was a rich province, and in the days of the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the [[Arabs]] in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.<ref name=\"M73\" />\n\n===Failure of the expedition===\n[[Image:BN MS FR 2628 Folio205 Amalric and Manuel.png|thumb|Manuel and the envoys of Amalric \u2013 arrival of the crusaders in [[Pelusium]] (from the Manuscript of [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in [[Acre, Israel]], 13th century, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]).]]\n\nThe joined forces of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to [[Damietta]] on 27 October 1169, but the siege was unsuccessful due to the failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully.<ref name=\"R84-86\">R.

When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do as part of his treaty obligations, Manuel decided that it was time to deal with the Turks once and for all.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Magdalino, pp. 78 and 95\u201396</ref><ref name=\"P140\">K.

W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 128</ref>\n\nYet Manuel's army of 35,000 men was large and unwieldy \u2013 according to a letter that Manuel sent to King [[Henry II of England]], the advancing column was ten miles (16&nbsp;km) long.<ref>Birkenmeier, p. 132.</ref> Manuel marched against Iconium via [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], [[Chonae]], Lampe, [[Celaenae]], Choma, and [[Antioch, Pisidia|Antioch]]. Just outside the entrance to the pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.<ref name=Norwich />\n\nManuel made serious tactical errors, such as failing to properly scout out the route ahead.<ref name=\"JBr176\">J. Bradbury, ''Medieval Warfare'', 176</ref> These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was checked by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"MN102\">D. MacGillivray Nicol, ''Byzantium and Venice'', 102</ref> The Byzantines were hemmed in by the narrowness of the pass, this allowed the Seljuks to concentrate their attacks on part of the Byzantine army, especially the baggage and siege train, without the rest being able to intervene.<ref>Haldon 2001, pp. 142-143</ref> The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw \u2013 without [[siege engine]]s, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both during and after the battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement;<ref name=\"M98\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 98</ref> according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.\n\nThe terms by which Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were that he should remove his forts and armies on the frontier at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep his side of the earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum.<ref name=\"Treadgold649\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 649</ref> Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the [[Battle of Manzikert]], 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not decisively defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.<ref name=\"MN102\" />\n\nThe defeat at Myriokephalon has often been depicted as a catastrophe in which the entire Byzantine army was destroyed. Manuel himself compared the defeat to Manzikert; it seemed to him that the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon complemented the destruction at Manzikert. In reality, although a defeat, it was not too costly and did not significantly diminish the Byzantine army.<ref name=\"MN102\" /> Most of the casualties were borne by the right wing, largely composed of allied troops commanded by Baldwin of Antioch, and also by the baggage train, which was the main target of the Turkish ambush.<ref name=\"JBP\">J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 128<br />* K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Greek Nation'', Db, 141</ref>\n\nThe limited losses inflicted on native Byzantine troops were quickly recovered, and in the following year Manuel's forces defeated a force of \"picked Turks\".<ref name=\"JB128\" /> [[John Komnenos Vatatzes]], who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion, not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way. Vatatzes caught the Turks in an ambush as they were crossing the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes|Meander River]], the subsequent [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir]] effectively destroyed them as a fighting force. This is an indication that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western [[Asia Minor]] was still successful.<ref name=\"JB196\">J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 196</ref> After the victory on the Meander, Manuel himself advanced with a small army to drive the Turks from [[Banaz|Panasium]], south of [[Cotyaeum]].<ref name=\"Treadgold649\"/>\n\nIn 1178, however, a Byzantine army retreated after encountering a Turkish force at [[Hereke|Charax]], allowing the Turks to capture many livestock.<ref name = \"Stone\"/> The city of [[Claudiopolis (Bithynia)|Claudiopolis]] in [[Bithynia]] was [[Siege of Claudiopolis|besieged]] by the Turks in 1179, forcing Manuel to lead a small cavalry force to save the city, and then, even as late as 1180, the Byzantines succeeded in scoring a victory over the Turks.<ref name=\"Stone\">A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref>\n\nThe continuous warfare had a serious effect upon Manuel's vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever. Furthermore, like Manzikert, the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift \u2013 Manuel never again attacked the Turks, and after his death they began to move further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.\n\n==Doctrinal controversies (1156\u20131180)==\n[[Image:Johnchrysostom.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine [[mosaic]] of [[John Chrysostom]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] (9th/10th century).

Kurtz, ''History of the Christian Church to the Restoration'', 265\u2013266</ref> In the end a [[synod]] held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the [[Holy Trinity]], despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\nTen years later, a controversy arose as to whether the saying of Christ, \"My Father is greater than I\", referred to his divine nature, to his human nature, or to the union of the two.<ref name=\"K265-266\" /> Demetrius of Lampe, a Byzantine diplomat recently returned from the West, ridiculed the way the verse was interpreted there, that Christ was inferior to his father in his humanity but equal in his divinity. Manuel, on the other hand, perhaps with an eye on the project for Church union, found that the formula made sense, and prevailed over a majority in a synod convened on 2 March 1166 to decide the issue, where he had the support of the patriarch [[Luke Chrysoberges]]<ref name=\"Stone\" /> and later Patriarch [[Patriarch Michael III of Constantinople|Michael III]].<ref>P. Magdalino, p. 279.</ref> Those who refused to submit to the synod's decisions had their property confiscated or were exiled.{{Cref|g}} The political dimensions of this controversy are apparent from the fact that a leading dissenter from the Emperor's doctrine was his nephew Alexios Kontostephanos.<ref name=\"M217\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 217</ref>\n\nA third controversy sprung up in 1180, when Manuel objected to the formula of solemn [[abjuration]], which was exacted from Muslim converts. One of the more striking [[anathema]]s of this abjuration was that directed against the deity worshipped by [[Muhammad]] and his followers:<ref name=\"Hanson55\">G. L. Hanson, ''Manuel I Komnenos and the \"God of Muhammad\"'', 55</ref>\n\n{{quote | And before all, I anathematize the God of Muhammad about whom he [Muhammad] says, \"He is God alone, God made of solid, hammer-beaten metal; He begets not and is not begotten, nor is there like unto Him any one.\"}}\n\nThe emperor ordered the deletion of this anathema from the Church's catechetical texts, a measure that provoked vehement opposition from both the Patriarch and bishops.<ref name=\"Hanson55\" />\n\n==Chivalric narrations==\nManuel is representative of a new kind of Byzantine ruler who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders. He arranged [[jousting]] matches, even participating in them, an unusual and discomforting sight for the Byzantines. Endowed with a fine physique, Manuel has been the subject of exaggeration in the Byzantine sources of his era, where he is presented as a man of great personal courage. According to the story of his exploits, which appear as a model or a copy of the romances of [[chivalry]], such was his strength and exercise in arms that Raymond of Antioch was incapable of wielding his lance and buckler. In a famous tournament, he is said to have entered the lists on a fiery [[courser (horse)|courser]], and to have overturned two of the stoutest Italian knights. In one day, he is said to have slain forty Turks with his own hand, and in a battle against the Hungarians he allegedly snatched a banner, and was the first, almost alone, who passed a bridge that separated his army from the enemy. On another occasion, he is said to have cut his way through a squadron of five hundred Turks, without receiving a wound; he had previously posted an ambuscade in a wood and was accompanied only by his brother and Axouch.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 73<br />* K.

By the time he died in 1180, 37 years had passed since that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.<ref name=\"M3\" />\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"The most singular feature in the character of Manuel is the contrast and vicissitude of labour and sloth, of hardiness and effeminacy. In war he seemed ignorant of peace, in peace he appeared incapable of war.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | '''''Edward Gibbon'''''<ref name=\"G74\"/>\n|}\n\nManuel had proven himself to be an energetic emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, in spite of his military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish [[Sultanate]] of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the [[Peace of Venice]]. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies.<ref name=\"B5-6\">M. Bartusis, ''The Late Byzantine Army'', 5\u20136</ref> According to [[Edward Gibbon]], Manuel's victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.<ref name=\"G74\">Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', p. 74.</ref>\n\nHis advisors on western church affairs included the Pisan scholar [[Hugh Eteriano]].\n\n===Internal affairs===\nChoniates criticised Manuel for raising taxes and pointed to Manuel's reign as a period of excession; according to Choniates, the money thus raised was spent lavishly at the cost of his citizens. Whether one reads the Greek [[encomium|encomiastic]] sources, or the Latin and oriental sources, the impression is consistent with Choniates' picture of an emperor who spent lavishly in all available ways, rarely economising in one sector in order to develop another.<ref name=\"P121\"/> Manuel spared no expense on the army, the navy, diplomacy, ceremonial, palace-building, the Komnenian family, and other seekers of patronage. A significant amount of this expenditure was pure financial loss to the Empire, like the subsidies poured into Italy and the crusader states, and the sums spent on the failed expeditions of 1155\u20131156, 1169, and 1176.<ref name=Niketas1>N. Choniates, ''O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates'', 96\u201397<br />* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 173</ref>\n\nThe problems this created were counterbalanced to some extent by his successes, particularly in the Balkans; Manuel extended the frontiers of his Empire in the Balkan region, ensuring security for the whole of Greece and [[Bulgaria]]. Had he been more successful in all his ventures, he would have controlled not only the most productive farmland around the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, but also the entire trading facilities of the area. Even if he did not achieve his ambitious goals, his wars against Hungary brought him control of the Dalmatian coast, the rich agricultural region of Sirmium, and the Danube trade route from Hungary to the [[Black Sea]]. His Balkan expeditions are said to have taken great booty in slaves and livestock;<ref name=\"M174\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 174</ref> Kinnamos was impressed by the amount of arms taken from the Hungarian dead after the battle of 1167.<ref>J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 274</ref> And even if Manuel's wars against the Turks probably realised a net loss, his commanders took livestock and captives on at least two occasions.<ref name=\"M174\" />\n\nThis allowed the Western provinces to flourish in an economic revival that had begun in the time of his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, it has been argued that Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] invasion during the reign of [[Heraclius|Herakleios]], some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread.<ref name=Angold>M. Angold, ''The Byzantine Empire, 1025\u20131204''</ref> Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the ''kommerkion'', a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports.<ref name=\"kom\">J. Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 25</ref> The ''kommerkion'' was stated to have collected 20,000 ''hyperpyra'' each day.<ref name=\"kom2\">J. Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 26</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Constantinople was undergoing expansion. The cosmopolitan character of the city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the [[Genoa|Genoese]], and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople.<ref name=\"Day\">G. W. Day, ''Manuel and the Genoese'', 289\u2013290</ref> These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly [[agrarian economy]].<ref name=\"M143-144\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 143\u2013144</ref> [[Thessaloniki]], the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]], silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this is a testament to the success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a ''Pax Byzantina'' in these heartland territories.<ref name=Angold />\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Image:The Byzantine Empire, c.1180.PNG|thumb|350px|Map of the Byzantine Empire under Manuel, c. 1180]]\n\nTo the [[rhetor]]s of his court, Manuel was the \"divine emperor\". A generation after his death, Choniates referred to him as \"the most blessed among emperors\", and a century later John Stavrakios described him as \"great in fine deeds\". [[John Phokas]], a soldier who fought in Manuel's army, characterised him some years later as the \"world saving\" and glorious emperor.<ref name=\"DH\">J.

In the 1160s the nave was redecorated with mosaics showing the councils of the church.<ref>B. Zeitler, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3046063 Cross-cultural interpretations]</ref> Manuel was one of the patrons of the work. On the south wall, an inscription in Greek reads: \"the present work was finished by Ephraim the monk, painter and mosaicist, in the reign of the great emperor Manuel Porphyrogennetos Komnenos and in the time of the great [[king of Jerusalem]], [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]].\" That Manuel's name was placed first was a symbolic, public recognition of Manuel's overlordship as leader of the Christian world. Manuel's role as protector of the Orthodox Christians and Christian holy places in general is also evident in his successful attempts to secure rights over the Holy Land. Manuel participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, where thanks to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon|Raynald]], [[Prince of Antioch]], and Amalric, King of Jerusalem respectively. Manuel was also the last Byzantine emperor who, thanks to his military and diplomatic success in the [[Balkans]], could call himself \"ruler of [[Dalmatia]], [[Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Hungary]]\".<ref name=\"S372-373\">J. W. Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages'', 372\u2013373</ref>\n\nByzantium looked impressive when Manuel died in 1180, having just celebrated the betrothal of his son Alexios II to the daughter of the king of France.<ref name=\"M194\">P. Magdalino, ''The Medieval Empire'', 194</ref> Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.<ref name=\"M194\" />\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Manuel I Komnenos\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Here Conrad is accused of wanting to take Constantinople by force, and to install a Latin patriarch (''Manganeios Prodromos'', no 20.1).<ref name=\"M49\">Jeffreys-Jeffreys, ''The \"Wild Beast from the West\"'', 102<br />* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 49</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|b|According to [[Paul Magdalino]], one of Manuel's primary goals was a partition of Italy with the German empire, in which Byzantium would get the [[Adriatic coast]]. His unilateral pursuit, however, antagonized the new German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, whose own plans for imperial restoration ruled out any partnership with Byzantium. Manuel was thus obliged to treat Frederick as his main enemy, and to form a web of relationships with other western powers, including the papacy, his old enemy, the Norman kingdom, Hungary, several magnates and cities throughout Italy, and, above all, the crusader states.<ref name=\"M194\" />}}\n{{Cnote|c|Magdalino underscores that, whereas John had removed the Rupenid princes from power in Cilicia twenty years earlier, Manuel allowed Toros to hold most of his strongholds he had taken, and effectively restored only the coastal area to imperial rule. From Raynald, Manuel secured recognition of imperial suzerainty over Antioch, with the promise to hand over the citadel, to instal a [[Patriarch of Antioch|patriarch]] sent from Constantinople (not actually implemented until 1165\u201366), and to provide troops for the emperor's service, but nothing seems to have been said about the reversion of Antioch to direct imperial rule. According to Magdalino, this suggests that Manuel had dropped this demand on which both his grandfather and father insisted.<ref name=\"M67\" /> For his part, Medieval historian [[Zachary Nugent Brooke]] believes that the victory of Christianity against Nur ad-Din was made impossible, since both Greeks and Latins were concerned primarily with their own interests. He characterises the policy of Manuel as \"short-sighted\", because \"he lost a splendid opportunity of recovering the former possessions of the Empire, and by his departure threw away most of the actual fruits of his expedition\".<ref name=\"Br482\">Z.

His reign saw the last flowering of the [[Komnenian restoration]], during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival.\n\nEager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with the [[Pope Adrian IV|Pope]] and the resurgent [[Latin West|West]]. He invaded the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]], although unsuccessfully, being the last Eastern Roman Emperor to attempt reconquests in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The passage of the potentially dangerous [[Second Crusade]] through his empire was adroitly managed. Manuel [[Manuel I Komnenos#Manuel in Antioch|established a Byzantine protectorate]] over the [[Crusader states]] of [[Outremer]]. Facing [[Muslim]] advances in the [[Holy Land]], he made common cause with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|participated in a combined invasion]] of [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]. Manuel reshaped the political maps of the [[Balkans]] and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and Outremer under Byzantine [[hegemony]] and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east.\n\nHowever, towards the end of his reign Manuel's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at [[Battle of Myriokephalon|Myriokephalon]], which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] position. Although the [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir|Byzantines recovered]] and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]], Myriokephalon proved to be [[Battle of Myriokephalon#Aftermath|the final, unsuccessful effort]] by the empire to recover the interior of [[Anatolia]] from the [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]].\n\nCalled ''ho Megas'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2}}, translated as \"[[the Great]]\") by the [[Greeks]], Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, [[John Kinnamos]], in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of \"the most blessed emperor of [[Constantinople]]\" in parts of the [[Western Christianity|Latin world]] as well.<ref name=\"M3\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3</ref> Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him. Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the [[Komnenos|dynasty]] he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.<ref name=\"M3-4\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 3\u20134</ref>\n\n==Accession to the throne==\n[[Image:BN MS FR 2628 Folio134 Comnenus.png|thumb|left|200px|Death of John II Komnenos, and crowning of Manuel I Komnenos (from the Manuscript of [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in [[Acre, Israel]], 13th century, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]).]]\n\nManuel Komnenos was the fourth son of [[John II Komnenos]] and [[Piroska of Hungary]], so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father.<ref name = \"Stone\"/> His maternal grandfather was [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. Ladislaus]]. Having distinguished himself in his father's war against the Seljuk Turks, in 1143 Manuel was chosen as his successor by John, in preference to his elder surviving brother [[Isaac Komnenos (son of John II)|Isaac]]. After John died on 8 April 1143, his son, Manuel, was acclaimed emperor by the armies.<ref name=\"Gib72\">Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72</ref> Yet his succession was by no means assured: At his father's deathbed in the wilds of [[Cilicia]] far from Constantinople, he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible. He still had to take care of his father's funeral, and tradition demanded he organise the foundation of a monastery on the spot where his father died. Swiftly, he dispatched the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[John Axouch]] ahead of him, with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival, his brother Isaac, who was living in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia. Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor's death had reached it. He quickly secured the loyalty of the city, and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143, he was crowned by the new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]], [[Michael II Kourkouas|Michael Kourkouas]]. A few days later, with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure, Manuel ordered the release of Isaac.<ref name=\"NGS\">Gibbon, ''The decline and fall of the Roman Empire'', 72<br />* J. H. Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium''<br />* A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref> Then he ordered 2 golden pieces to be given to every householder in Constantinople and 200 pounds of gold (including 200 silver pieces annually) to be given to the Byzantine Church.<ref name=\"gold\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', 87\u201388</ref>\n\nThe empire that Manuel inherited from his father had undergone great changes since the foundation of Constantinople by [[Constantine I]] eight centuries before. In the time of his predecessor [[Justinian I]] (527\u2013565), parts of the former Western Roman Empire had been recovered including Italy, Africa and part of Spain. However, the empire had diminished greatly following this, the most obvious change had occurred in the 7th century: the soldiers of [[Islam]] had taken [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)#Middle Ages|Palestine]] and much of [[Syria]] away from the empire irrevocably. They had then swept on westwards into what in the time of Constantine had been the western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]], in North Africa and Spain. In the centuries since, the emperors had ruled over a realm that largely consisted of [[Asia Minor]] in the east, and the Balkans in the west.  In the late 11th century the Byzantine Empire entered a period of marked military and political decline, which had been arrested and largely reversed by the leadership of Manuel's grandfather and father. Yet the empire that Manuel inherited was a polity facing formidable challenges. At the end of the 11th century, the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine Emperor. The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central [[Anatolia]]. And in the [[Levant]], a new force had appeared \u2013 the [[Crusader states]] \u2013 which presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges. Now, more than at any time during the preceding centuries, the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed.<ref name=\"PLBr\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantium|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britannica|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==Second Crusade and Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon==\n{{details|Second Crusade}}\n\n===Prince of Antioch===\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The County of Edessa in the context of the other states of the [[Near East]] in 1135]]\nThe first test of Manuel's reign came in 1144, when he was faced with a demand by [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]] for the cession of Cilician territories. However, later that year the crusader [[County of Edessa]] was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic [[jihad]] under [[Imad ad-Din Atabeg Zengi|Imad ad-Din Zengi]]. Raymond realized that immediate help from the west was out of the question.  With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat, there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople. Swallowing his pride, he made the journey north to ask for the protection of the Emperor. After submitting to Manuel, he was promised the support that he had requested, and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured.<ref name=\"M173\">J.

Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 40</ref>\n\n===Expedition against Konya===\nIn 1146 Manuel assembled his army at the military base [[Lopadion]] and set out on a [[punitive expedition]] against [[Mesud I|Masud]] the Sultan of [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm|R\u00fbm]], who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western [[Anatolia]] and [[Cilicia]].<ref name=\"Tread640\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 640</ref> There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel's army defeated the Turks at [[Afyonkarahisar|Acro\u00ebnus]], before capturing and destroying the fortified town of [[Philomelion]], removing its remaining Christian population.<ref name=\"Tread640\" /> The Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, [[Konya]], and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls. Among Manuel's motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride.<ref>J.

Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 42</ref> While on this campaign Manuel received a letter from [[Louis VII of France]] announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states.<ref>Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', p. 42</ref>\n\n===Arrival of the Crusaders===\n[[Image:Arriv\u00e9e des crois\u00e9s \u00e0 Constantinople.jpg|thumb|left|Arrival of the Second Crusade before Constantinople, portrayed in Jean Fouquet's painting from around 1455\u20131460, ''Arriv\u00e9e des crois\u00e9s \u00e0 Constantinople''.]]\n\nManuel was prevented from following up his early successes in the east, for events to the west meant that his presence was urgently required in the Balkans. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under [[Conrad III of Germany]] and [[Louis VII of France]]. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the [[First Crusade]], a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel's aunt, [[Anna Komnene]].<ref name=\"AC333\">A. Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', 333</ref>\n\nMany Byzantines feared the Crusade, a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame,  precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution \u2013 which his grandfather had not taken \u2013 of making repairs to the [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]], and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad's army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two.{{Cref|a}} Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos|Kinnamos]] describes a full-scale [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|clash]] between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad's army, outside the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Damalis]] on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.<ref>Kinnamos, pp. 65-67</ref><ref>Birkenmeier, p. 110</ref>\n\nAfter 1147, however, the relations between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law [[Bertha of Sulzbach]] he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against [[Roger II of Sicily]].<ref name=\"M621\">P.

In the winter of 1158\u201359, he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Thoros II of Armenia|Thoros of Cilicia]], who had participated in the attack on Cyprus.<ref name=\"M67\">P.

Realising that he had no hope of defeating Manuel, Raynald also knew that he could not expect any help from king [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]. Baldwin did not approve of Raynald's attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel. Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope. He appeared before the Emperor, dressed in a sack with a rope tied around his neck, and begged for forgiveness. Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were \"disgusted\" by it.<ref>B. Hamilton, ''William of Tyre and the Byzantine Empire'', 226<br />* William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#23 23]</ref> Eventually, Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he would become a vassal of the Empire, effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium.<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\n[[File:Principality of Antioch under byzantine protection.png|thumb|left|Antioch under Byzantine protection (1159\u20131180)]]\n\nPeace having been restored, a grand ceremonial procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding through the streets on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the [[King of Jerusalem]] followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, at the head of a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the ruler of [[Syria]], of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.<ref name=Norwich>Z.

On their way back, his troops were surprised in line of march by the Turks. Despite this, they won a complete victory, routing the enemy army from the field and inflicting heavy losses. In the following year, Manuel drove the Turks out of [[Isauria]].<ref name=\"P121\">K.

However, despite being distracted by a [[Cuman]] attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of [[Conrad III of Germany]], and the help of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent [[George of Antioch]] with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs.<ref name=\"Nor\">J.

The [[Papacy]] was never on good terms with the Normans, except when under duress by the threat of direct military action. Having the \"civilised\" Byzantines on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily. It was in the interest of [[Pope Adrian IV]] to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the [[Papal Curia|Curia]].<ref name=\"W18-2\">William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XVIII, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/18.html#2 2]</ref> Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.<ref name=\"D122\" />\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Alexios Komnenos and Doukas ... had become captive to the Sicilians' lord [and] again ruined matters.

Byzantine commander Michael Palaiologos alienated allies with his attitude, stalling the campaign as Count [[Robert III of Loritello]] refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign had lost some of its momentum: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople, and his loss was a major blow to the campaign. The turning point was the [[Battle of Brindisi (1156)|Battle of Brindisi]], where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries that had been hired with Manuel's gold demanded huge increases in their pay. When this was refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon John Doukas was left hopelessly outnumbered. The arrival of [[Alexios Komnenos Bryennios]] with some ships failed to retrieve the Byzantine position.{{Cref|d}} The naval battle was decided in favour of the Sicilians, while John Doukas and Alexios Bryennios (along with four Byzantine ships) were captured.<ref name=\"B115\">J.

Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches,{{Cref|e}} hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. [[Pope Adrian IV]] and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other.<ref name=\"Vas7\" /> Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West.<ref>J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 114</ref> Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' by the popes. And although he twice sent embassies to [[Pope Alexander III]] (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, Alexander refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.<ref name=\"AGB\">Abb\u00e9 Guett\u00e9e, ''The Papacy'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20040322110754/http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/guettee10.html Chapter VII]<br />* J.

The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 ''hyperpyra'' or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.<ref name=\"B116\">J.

Due to distraction from his neighbours on the [[Balkan Peninsula|Balkan frontier]], Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]] since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of [[Grand Principality of Ra\u0161ka|Rascia]], being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\n[[Image:Hyperryron-Manuel I-sb1965.jpg|thumb|A ''[[hyperpyron]]'', a form of Byzantine coinage, issued by Manuel.

In the wars of 1151\u20131153 and 1163\u20131168 Manuel led his troops into Hungary and a spectacular raid deep into enemy territory yielded substantial war booty. In 1167, Manuel sent 15,000 men under the command of [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]] against the Hungarians,<ref>J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 241</ref> scoring a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Sirmium]] and enabling the Empire to conclude a very advantageous peace with the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]] by which [[Syrmia]], [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], and [[Dalmatia]] were ceded. By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands.<ref name=\"JWS372\">J. W. Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages'', 372</ref>\n\nEfforts were also made towards a diplomatic annexation of Hungary. The Hungarian heir [[Bela III of Hungary|B\u00e9la]], younger brother of the Hungarian king [[Stephen III of Hungary|Stephen III]], was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the emperor's court. Manuel intended the youth to marry his daughter, [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria]], and to make him his heir, thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire. At court B\u00e9la assumed the name Alexius and received the title of ''[[Despotism|Despot]]'', which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself. However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation. In 1169, Manuel's young wife gave birth to a son, thus depriving B\u00e9la of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary). Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and B\u00e9la went home to take his throne. Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always \"keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans\". B\u00e9la III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary.<ref name=\"JWS372\" />\n\n==Relations with Russia==\nManuel Komnenos attempted to draw the Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, and to a lesser extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince [[Iziaslav II of Kiev]] was related to [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] of [[Suzdal]] was Manuel's ally (''symmachos''), and [[Volodymyrko Volodarovych|Vladimirko]] of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] is described as Manuel's vassal (''hypospondos''). Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over [[Kiev]] and [[Yaroslav Osmomysl|Yaroslav]], the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.<ref>D. Obolensky, ''The Byzantine Commonwealth'', 299\u2013300.</ref>\n\nIn 1164-65 Manuel's cousin [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos]], the future emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and fled to the court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince [[Rostislav I of Kiev|Rostislav]], resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the [[Cuman people|Cumans]].<ref>D. Obolensky, ''The Byzantine Commonwealth'', 300\u2013302.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of relations with Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the [[Walachian Plain]] and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps ([[Southern Carpathians]]), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the [[Sirmium]] and [[Belgrade]] frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of [[Transylvania]] being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.<ref>M.

In the autumn of 1169 Manuel sent a joint expedition with Amalric to Egypt: a Byzantine army and a naval force of 20 large [[warships]], 150 [[galleys]], and 60 [[Horse transports in the Middle Ages|transports]], under the command of the ''[[megas doux]]'' Andronikos Kontostephanos, joined forces with Amalric at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"M74\" /><ref name=\"fleet\">J.

This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that in the context of the wider struggle between the crusader states and the [[Islam]]ic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing [[Fatimid]] [[Caliphate]] of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.<ref name=\"M73\" />\n\nA successful invasion of Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt was a rich province, and in the days of the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the [[Arabs]] in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.<ref name=\"M73\" />\n\n===Failure of the expedition===\n[[Image:BN MS FR 2628 Folio205 Amalric and Manuel.png|thumb|Manuel and the envoys of Amalric \u2013 arrival of the crusaders in [[Pelusium]] (from the Manuscript of [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in [[Acre, Israel]], 13th century, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]).]]\n\nThe joined forces of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to [[Damietta]] on 27 October 1169, but the siege was unsuccessful due to the failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully.<ref name=\"R84-86\">R. Rogers, ''Latin Siege Warfare in the Twelfth Century'', 84\u201386</ref> According to Byzantine forces, Amalric, not wanting to share the profits of victory, dragged out the operation until the emperor's men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine; Amalric then launched an assault, which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders. On the other hand, William of Tyre remarked that the Greeks were not entirely blameless.<ref>William of Tyre, ''Historia'', XX [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/20.html#15 15\u201317]</ref> Whatever the truth of the allegations of both sides, when the rains came, both the Latin army and the Byzantine fleet returned home, although half of the Byzantine fleet was lost in a sudden storm.<ref name=\"TM68\">T.

This ambush destroyed Manuel's hope of capturing Konya]]\nBetween 1158\u20131162, a series of Byzantine campaigns against the [[Seljuk Turks]] of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] resulted in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of [[Sivas]], should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]] to recognize his overlordship.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>I. Health, ''Byzantine Armies'', 4</ref> Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] the ruler of Syria, to expel the [[Danishmends]] from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do as part of his treaty obligations, Manuel decided that it was time to deal with the Turks once and for all.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Magdalino, pp. 78 and 95\u201396</ref><ref name=\"P140\">K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Greek Nation'', Db, 140</ref> Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, [[Iconium]] ([[Konya]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of [[Dorylaeum]] and [[Sublaeum]], and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.<ref name=\"JB128\">J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 128</ref>\n\nYet Manuel's army of 35,000 men was large and unwieldy \u2013 according to a letter that Manuel sent to King [[Henry II of England]], the advancing column was ten miles (16&nbsp;km) long.<ref>Birkenmeier, p. 132.</ref> Manuel marched against Iconium via [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], [[Chonae]], Lampe, [[Celaenae]], Choma, and [[Antioch, Pisidia|Antioch]]. Just outside the entrance to the pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.<ref name=Norwich />\n\nManuel made serious tactical errors, such as failing to properly scout out the route ahead.<ref name=\"JBr176\">J. Bradbury, ''Medieval Warfare'', 176</ref> These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was checked by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"MN102\">D. MacGillivray Nicol, ''Byzantium and Venice'', 102</ref> The Byzantines were hemmed in by the narrowness of the pass, this allowed the Seljuks to concentrate their attacks on part of the Byzantine army, especially the baggage and siege train, without the rest being able to intervene.<ref>Haldon 2001, pp. 142-143</ref> The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw \u2013 without [[siege engine]]s, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both during and after the battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement;<ref name=\"M98\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 98</ref> according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.\n\nThe terms by which Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were that he should remove his forts and armies on the frontier at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep his side of the earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum.<ref name=\"Treadgold649\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 649</ref> Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the [[Battle of Manzikert]], 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not decisively defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.<ref name=\"MN102\" />\n\nThe defeat at Myriokephalon has often been depicted as a catastrophe in which the entire Byzantine army was destroyed. Manuel himself compared the defeat to Manzikert; it seemed to him that the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon complemented the destruction at Manzikert. In reality, although a defeat, it was not too costly and did not significantly diminish the Byzantine army.<ref name=\"MN102\" /> Most of the casualties were borne by the right wing, largely composed of allied troops commanded by Baldwin of Antioch, and also by the baggage train, which was the main target of the Turkish ambush.<ref name=\"JBP\">J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 128<br />* K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Greek Nation'', Db, 141</ref>\n\nThe limited losses inflicted on native Byzantine troops were quickly recovered, and in the following year Manuel's forces defeated a force of \"picked Turks\".<ref name=\"JB128\" /> [[John Komnenos Vatatzes]], who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion, not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way. Vatatzes caught the Turks in an ambush as they were crossing the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes|Meander River]], the subsequent [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir]] effectively destroyed them as a fighting force. This is an indication that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western [[Asia Minor]] was still successful.<ref name=\"JB196\">J. W. Birkenmeier, ''The Development of the Komnenian Army'', 196</ref> After the victory on the Meander, Manuel himself advanced with a small army to drive the Turks from [[Banaz|Panasium]], south of [[Cotyaeum]].<ref name=\"Treadgold649\"/>\n\nIn 1178, however, a Byzantine army retreated after encountering a Turkish force at [[Hereke|Charax]], allowing the Turks to capture many livestock.<ref name = \"Stone\"/> The city of [[Claudiopolis (Bithynia)|Claudiopolis]] in [[Bithynia]] was [[Siege of Claudiopolis|besieged]] by the Turks in 1179, forcing Manuel to lead a small cavalry force to save the city, and then, even as late as 1180, the Byzantines succeeded in scoring a victory over the Turks.<ref name=\"Stone\">A. Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref>\n\nThe continuous warfare had a serious effect upon Manuel's vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever. Furthermore, like Manzikert, the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift \u2013 Manuel never again attacked the Turks, and after his death they began to move further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.\n\n==Doctrinal controversies (1156\u20131180)==\n[[Image:Johnchrysostom.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine [[mosaic]] of [[John Chrysostom]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] (9th/10th century). The controversy of 1156\u201357 concerned the interpretation of John's liturgy for the [[Eucharist]], \"Thou art He who offers and is offered and receives.\"]]\n\nThree major theological controversies occurred during Manuel's reign. In 1156\u20131157 the question was raised whether [[Jesus|Christ]] had offered himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world to the [[God the Father|Father]] and to the [[Holy Spirit]] only, or also to [[Jesus Christ the Logos|the Logos]] (i.e., to himself).<ref name=\"K265-266\">J. H. Kurtz, ''History of the Christian Church to the Restoration'', 265\u2013266</ref> In the end a [[synod]] held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the [[Holy Trinity]], despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\nTen years later, a controversy arose as to whether the saying of Christ, \"My Father is greater than I\", referred to his divine nature, to his human nature, or to the union of the two.<ref name=\"K265-266\" /> Demetrius of Lampe, a Byzantine diplomat recently returned from the West, ridiculed the way the verse was interpreted there, that Christ was inferior to his father in his humanity but equal in his divinity. Manuel, on the other hand, perhaps with an eye on the project for Church union, found that the formula made sense, and prevailed over a majority in a synod convened on 2 March 1166 to decide the issue, where he had the support of the patriarch [[Luke Chrysoberges]]<ref name=\"Stone\" /> and later Patriarch [[Patriarch Michael III of Constantinople|Michael III]].<ref>P. Magdalino, p. 279.</ref> Those who refused to submit to the synod's decisions had their property confiscated or were exiled.{{Cref|g}} The political dimensions of this controversy are apparent from the fact that a leading dissenter from the Emperor's doctrine was his nephew Alexios Kontostephanos.<ref name=\"M217\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 217</ref>\n\nA third controversy sprung up in 1180, when Manuel objected to the formula of solemn [[abjuration]], which was exacted from Muslim converts. One of the more striking [[anathema]]s of this abjuration was that directed against the deity worshipped by [[Muhammad]] and his followers:<ref name=\"Hanson55\">G. L. Hanson, ''Manuel I Komnenos and the \"God of Muhammad\"'', 55</ref>\n\n{{quote | And before all, I anathematize the God of Muhammad about whom he [Muhammad] says, \"He is God alone, God made of solid, hammer-beaten metal; He begets not and is not begotten, nor is there like unto Him any one.\"}}\n\nThe emperor ordered the deletion of this anathema from the Church's catechetical texts, a measure that provoked vehement opposition from both the Patriarch and bishops.<ref name=\"Hanson55\" />\n\n==Chivalric narrations==\nManuel is representative of a new kind of Byzantine ruler who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders. He arranged [[jousting]] matches, even participating in them, an unusual and discomforting sight for the Byzantines. Endowed with a fine physique, Manuel has been the subject of exaggeration in the Byzantine sources of his era, where he is presented as a man of great personal courage. According to the story of his exploits, which appear as a model or a copy of the romances of [[chivalry]], such was his strength and exercise in arms that Raymond of Antioch was incapable of wielding his lance and buckler. In a famous tournament, he is said to have entered the lists on a fiery [[courser (horse)|courser]], and to have overturned two of the stoutest Italian knights. In one day, he is said to have slain forty Turks with his own hand, and in a battle against the Hungarians he allegedly snatched a banner, and was the first, almost alone, who passed a bridge that separated his army from the enemy. On another occasion, he is said to have cut his way through a squadron of five hundred Turks, without receiving a wound; he had previously posted an ambuscade in a wood and was accompanied only by his brother and Axouch.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 73<br />* K.

By the time he died in 1180, 37 years had passed since that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.<ref name=\"M3\" />\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"The most singular feature in the character of Manuel is the contrast and vicissitude of labour and sloth, of hardiness and effeminacy. In war he seemed ignorant of peace, in peace he appeared incapable of war.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | '''''Edward Gibbon'''''<ref name=\"G74\"/>\n|}\n\nManuel had proven himself to be an energetic emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, in spite of his military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish [[Sultanate]] of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the [[Peace of Venice]]. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies.<ref name=\"B5-6\">M. Bartusis, ''The Late Byzantine Army'', 5\u20136</ref> According to [[Edward Gibbon]], Manuel's victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.<ref name=\"G74\">Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', p. 74.</ref>\n\nHis advisors on western church affairs included the Pisan scholar [[Hugh Eteriano]].\n\n===Internal affairs===\nChoniates criticised Manuel for raising taxes and pointed to Manuel's reign as a period of excession; according to Choniates, the money thus raised was spent lavishly at the cost of his citizens. Whether one reads the Greek [[encomium|encomiastic]] sources, or the Latin and oriental sources, the impression is consistent with Choniates' picture of an emperor who spent lavishly in all available ways, rarely economising in one sector in order to develop another.<ref name=\"P121\"/> Manuel spared no expense on the army, the navy, diplomacy, ceremonial, palace-building, the Komnenian family, and other seekers of patronage. A significant amount of this expenditure was pure financial loss to the Empire, like the subsidies poured into Italy and the crusader states, and the sums spent on the failed expeditions of 1155\u20131156, 1169, and 1176.<ref name=Niketas1>N. Choniates, ''O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates'', 96\u201397<br />* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 173</ref>\n\nThe problems this created were counterbalanced to some extent by his successes, particularly in the Balkans; Manuel extended the frontiers of his Empire in the Balkan region, ensuring security for the whole of Greece and [[Bulgaria]]. Had he been more successful in all his ventures, he would have controlled not only the most productive farmland around the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, but also the entire trading facilities of the area. Even if he did not achieve his ambitious goals, his wars against Hungary brought him control of the Dalmatian coast, the rich agricultural region of Sirmium, and the Danube trade route from Hungary to the [[Black Sea]]. His Balkan expeditions are said to have taken great booty in slaves and livestock;<ref name=\"M174\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 174</ref> Kinnamos was impressed by the amount of arms taken from the Hungarian dead after the battle of 1167.<ref>J. Cinnamus, ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'', 274</ref> And even if Manuel's wars against the Turks probably realised a net loss, his commanders took livestock and captives on at least two occasions.<ref name=\"M174\" />\n\nThis allowed the Western provinces to flourish in an economic revival that had begun in the time of his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, it has been argued that Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] invasion during the reign of [[Heraclius|Herakleios]], some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread.<ref name=Angold>M. Angold, ''The Byzantine Empire, 1025\u20131204''</ref> Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the ''kommerkion'', a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports.<ref name=\"kom\">J. Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 25</ref> The ''kommerkion'' was stated to have collected 20,000 ''hyperpyra'' each day.<ref name=\"kom2\">J. Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 26</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Constantinople was undergoing expansion. The cosmopolitan character of the city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the [[Genoa|Genoese]], and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople.<ref name=\"Day\">G. W. Day, ''Manuel and the Genoese'', 289\u2013290</ref> These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly [[agrarian economy]].<ref name=\"M143-144\">P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 143\u2013144</ref> [[Thessaloniki]], the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]], silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this is a testament to the success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a ''Pax Byzantina'' in these heartland territories.<ref name=Angold />\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Image:The Byzantine Empire, c.1180.PNG|thumb|350px|Map of the Byzantine Empire under Manuel, c. 1180]]\n\nTo the [[rhetor]]s of his court, Manuel was the \"divine emperor\". A generation after his death, Choniates referred to him as \"the most blessed among emperors\", and a century later John Stavrakios described him as \"great in fine deeds\". [[John Phokas]], a soldier who fought in Manuel's army, characterised him some years later as the \"world saving\" and glorious emperor.<ref name=\"DH\">J.

In the 1160s the nave was redecorated with mosaics showing the councils of the church.<ref>B. Zeitler, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3046063 Cross-cultural interpretations]</ref> Manuel was one of the patrons of the work. On the south wall, an inscription in Greek reads: \"the present work was finished by Ephraim the monk, painter and mosaicist, in the reign of the great emperor Manuel Porphyrogennetos Komnenos and in the time of the great [[king of Jerusalem]], [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]].\" That Manuel's name was placed first was a symbolic, public recognition of Manuel's overlordship as leader of the Christian world. Manuel's role as protector of the Orthodox Christians and Christian holy places in general is also evident in his successful attempts to secure rights over the Holy Land. Manuel participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, where thanks to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon|Raynald]], [[Prince of Antioch]], and Amalric, King of Jerusalem respectively. Manuel was also the last Byzantine emperor who, thanks to his military and diplomatic success in the [[Balkans]], could call himself \"ruler of [[Dalmatia]], [[Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Hungary]]\".<ref name=\"S372-373\">J. W. Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages'', 372\u2013373</ref>\n\nByzantium looked impressive when Manuel died in 1180, having just celebrated the betrothal of his son Alexios II to the daughter of the king of France.<ref name=\"M194\">P. Magdalino, ''The Medieval Empire'', 194</ref> Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.<ref name=\"M194\" />\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Manuel I Komnenos\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Here Conrad is accused of wanting to take Constantinople by force, and to install a Latin patriarch (''Manganeios Prodromos'', no 20.1).<ref name=\"M49\">Jeffreys-Jeffreys, ''The \"Wild Beast from the West\"'', 102<br />* P. Magdalino, ''The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos'', 49</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|b|According to [[Paul Magdalino]], one of Manuel's primary goals was a partition of Italy with the German empire, in which Byzantium would get the [[Adriatic coast]]. His unilateral pursuit, however, antagonized the new German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, whose own plans for imperial restoration ruled out any partnership with Byzantium. Manuel was thus obliged to treat Frederick as his main enemy, and to form a web of relationships with other western powers, including the papacy, his old enemy, the Norman kingdom, Hungary, several magnates and cities throughout Italy, and, above all, the crusader states.<ref name=\"M194\" />}}\n{{Cnote|c|Magdalino underscores that, whereas John had removed the Rupenid princes from power in Cilicia twenty years earlier, Manuel allowed Toros to hold most of his strongholds he had taken, and effectively restored only the coastal area to imperial rule. From Raynald, Manuel secured recognition of imperial suzerainty over Antioch, with the promise to hand over the citadel, to instal a [[Patriarch of Antioch|patriarch]] sent from Constantinople (not actually implemented until 1165\u201366), and to provide troops for the emperor's service, but nothing seems to have been said about the reversion of Antioch to direct imperial rule. According to Magdalino, this suggests that Manuel had dropped this demand on which both his grandfather and father insisted.<ref name=\"M67\" /> For his part, Medieval historian [[Zachary Nugent Brooke]] believes that the victory of Christianity against Nur ad-Din was made impossible, since both Greeks and Latins were concerned primarily with their own interests. He characterises the policy of Manuel as \"short-sighted\", because \"he lost a splendid opportunity of recovering the former possessions of the Empire, and by his departure threw away most of the actual fruits of his expedition\".<ref name=\"Br482\">Z. N. Brooke, ''A History of Europe, from 911 to 1198'', 482</ref> According to [[Piers Paul Read]], Manuel's deal with Nur ad-Din was for the Latins another expression of Greeks' [[perfidy]].<ref name=\"R239\" />}}\n{{Cnote|d|Alexios had been ordered to bring soldiers, but he merely brought his empty ships to Brindisi.<ref name=\"B115\" />}}\n{{Cnote|e|In 1155 Hadrian sent legates to Manuel, with a letter for Basil, Archbishop of Thessaloniki, in which he exhorted that bishop to procure the re\u00fcnion of the churches. Basil answered that there was no division between the Greeks and Latins, since they held the same faith and offered the same sacrifice. \"As for the causes of scandal, weak in themselves, that have separated us from each other\", he added, \"your Holiness can cause them to cease, by your own extended authority and the help of the Emperor of the West.\"<ref name=\"AVII\">Abb\u00e9 Guett\u00e9e, ''The Papacy'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20040322110754/http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/guettee10.html Chapter VII]</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|f|This probably meant that Amalric repeated Baldwin's assurances regarding the status of Antioch as an imperial fief.<ref name=\"M74\" />}}\n{{Cnote|g|According to Michael Angold, after the controversy of 1166 Manuel took his responsibilities very seriously, and tightened his grip over the church. 1166 was also the year in which Manuel first referred in his legislation to his role as the disciplinarian of the church (''epistemonarkhes'').<ref name=\"An99\">M.

The mixing occurred between substructured populations instead of homogeneous populations, and at multiple times and at multiple geographic locations within a span of over thousands of years to produce the current South Asian population.

These migrations started approximately 1,800 BCE, after the invention of the war chariot, and also brought Indo-Aryan languages into the [[Levant]] and possibly [[Inner Asia]] and western [[China]].\n\nThe Indo-Aryan migration was part of the diffusion of [[Indo-European languages]] from the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Proto-Indo-European homeland]], either at the [[Pontic steppe]] or from a region between [[Armenia]] and [[Iran]], which started in the 7th to 4th millennia BCE.<ref>Johannes Krause mit Thomas Trappe: ''Die Reise unserer Gene.Eine Geschichte \u00fcber uns und unsere Vorfahren.''

Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989). ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'': CD liner notes</ref>\n\nMusically, \"Changes\" is built upon a distinct piano riff, featuring the keys going up in a \"diatonic major descent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} According to biographer [[Peter Doggett]], Bowie didn't know the chord changes on guitar or piano, but \"he followed his fingers as they crept, slowly up and down the keyboard, augmenting familiar shapes or simply reproducing them a step or two along the ivories.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The piano and bass are similar to album track \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album (and the label itself{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}}) on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> Upon release, like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Despite this, it became English disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]]'s record of the week.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!

[[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989). ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'': CD liner notes</ref>\n\nMusically, \"Changes\" is built upon a distinct piano riff, featuring the keys going up in a \"diatonic major descent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} According to biographer [[Peter Doggett]], Bowie didn't know the chord changes on guitar or piano, but \"he followed his fingers as they crept, slowly up and down the keyboard, augmenting familiar shapes or simply reproducing them a step or two along the ivories.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The piano and bass are similar to album track \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.)

He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"[[Oh!
