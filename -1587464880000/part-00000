As an engineering student, he came under scrutiny for an interest in \"some of the more liberal literature of the time.\"\n\nIn 1907, Loussac fled Tsarist Russia for [[Alaska]], living in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]], [[Iditarod, Alaska|Iditarod]] and [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] before settling down in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in 1916 to open a drugstore at Fourth Avenue and E Street. He sold out of the drugstore business in 1942, and turned his efforts to philanthropy.\n\nIn 1946, with the aid of [[Elmer E. Rasmuson]], Loussac created and endowed the Loussac Foundation, \"dedicated to the promotion of recreational, cultural, scientific or educational activities in the Anchorage area.\" The next year, Loussac was elected to the first of two consecutive terms as Mayor of Anchorage. In 1949, at the age 66, he married Ada Harper. It was his only marriage.\n\nIn 1951, the Loussac Foundation underwrote the construction of a new, modern building to house the library at Fifth Avenue and F Street, replacing the older, cramped facilities at Fifth and E Street.\n\nIn 1952, Loussac served as an [[Alaska Territory]] Delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]. Over time, he also served as President of the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, the [[Rotary Club]] and the Pioneers of Alaska.\n\nThe new library, which became known as the Loussac Library,  opened its doors in 1955, by which time, Loussac had retired to [[Seattle]]. The library building was also home to the Cook Inlet Historical Society Museum, which later became the [[Anchorage Museum of History and Art]].\n\nOn July 13, 1962, Loussac joined the municipally sponsored \"Loussac Day\" celebration to commemorate his 80th birthday. He died in Seattle on March 15, 1965. His ashes are interred in Angelus Memorial Park in Anchorage.\n\nThe first Loussac library was demolished in 1981 to make way for the [[William A. Egan Civic and Convention Center]]. In 1986, Anchorage opened a new four-story public library in midtown which was named the Z.J.
