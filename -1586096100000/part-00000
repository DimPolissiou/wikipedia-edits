The program broadcasts each weekday morning from 4:00 to 10:00 a.m. and each weekend morning from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.  [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]].\n\nThe program is formatted as a newscast with a somewhat less serious tone than WGN-TV's other local news programs and is known for its fun and rambunctious nature, with the anchors and reporters often shown more relaxed on-air, often pulling on-air pranks and practical jokes. The 4:00\u20136:00 a.m. portion of the newscast is more staid in tone to some extent and is a more generalized news/weather/sports/traffic format, while the 6:00\u201310:00 a.m. portion incorporates feature segments, interviews and includes some humorous elements.\n\nSince September 4th, hour-long weekend editions of the program have been aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 6:00 to 7:00 a.m., which is formatted more similarly to the station's midday and evening newscasts with a general news/weather/sports format. Since September 4th, unlike WGN-TV's other newscasts, the weekend morning newscasts did not use a two-anchor format; on the weekend of September 10-11, WGN added an expansion to the weekend morning newscasts. Firstly, by adding a two-anchor format as WGN reporter Tonya Francisco joined Sean Lewis to head the weekend mornings, Mike Hammernik has stayed with the newscast as weather presenter. Secondly, the scheduling of WGN's Weekend Morning News has moved from 6:00 to 7:00 a.m. and has expanded from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. making the broadcast match with programs like the weekday versions of the midday and evening news.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the program's launch, WGN-TV had already carried morning newscasts; the station ran five-minute news briefs following its morning movie showcases on weekdays from the 1970s through the early 1990s. WGN would later debut full-fledged, hour-long newscasts on Saturday and Sunday mornings at 8 a.m. in early 1992, this was unusual considering the weekday morning newscast would not debut for another two years (television stations typically do not carry local news programming on weekend mornings without a weekday morning program already in place). At the time the weekend morning programs debuted, the station ran the long-running Chicago television staple ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' on weekday mornings. By 1994, WGN station management decided to get out of the weekday children's television business and moved ''The Bozo Show'' to Sunday mornings, revamping it as ''[[The Bozo Super Sunday Show]]'' on September 11 of that year. In its place, the station decided to launch a new weekday morning newscast; the '''''WGN Morning News''''' made its debut on September 6, 1994 (debuting on a Tuesday due to the occurrence of [[Labor Day]] one day earlier) as an hour-long newscast from 7-8 a.m.; it was originally anchored by [https://www.pbs.org/food/chefs/dave-eckert/ Dave Eckert], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121110160530/http://www.wcnc.com/on-tv/bios/69488477.html Sonja Gantt] and meteorologist [http://minnesota.publicradio.org/about/people/mpr_people_display.php?aut_id=30162 Paul Huttner].<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-28/features/9408280284_1_current-affair-wbbm-wgn Fall Void Means It's Shuffle Time At Channel 2], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', August 28, 1994.</ref> Concurrent with the move of ''Bozo'' to Sundays, the Sunday morning newscast was cancelled.<ref name=\"WGN Morning\">{{cite news| url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2010/08/wgn-ch-9-plans-new-early-morning-weekend-news.html | work=Chicago Tribune | title=WGN-Ch. 9 plans new early morning weekend news | date=August 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year-and-a-half of its debut, the ''WGN Morning News'' was gradually expanded in length: first to two hours (retaining its 7 a.m. start time) in January 1996; an additional hour at 6 a.m. was added eight months later in August 1996.

The only instance where the ''WGN Morning News'' was carried nationally on WGN's superstation feed during this period was on September 12, 2001 as part of special coverage of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th terror attacks]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] All of WGN's news programming (including the SyndEx-restricted segments, but excluding the video portions of highlight footage during sports segments) is streamed over the station's website and through WGN's [[smartphone]] applications.\n\nWGN America restored a simulcast of the ''WGN Morning News'' to its schedule on February 3, 2014, airing only the first two hours of the broadcast, which replaced paid programming that occupied the 5:00\u20137:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] timeslot on the superstation feed (the addition concurred with the removal of the simulcast of WGN's 9 p.m. newscast, which was replaced by syndicated programming in that timeslot four days prior).<ref name=\"WGN News Loses National Platform\">[http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/02/05/wgn-9-p-m-news-loses-national-platform/ WGN news loses national platform], [[Robert Feder]], February 5, 2014.</ref> WGN America restricted carriage of the program on December 15, 2014 to certain markets, with paid programming as a substitution in most others as a result of its transition to a basic cable network; because of this, WGN-TV's newscasts are now available worldwide only through the station's website, www.wgntv.com, and on television outside of the Chicago market via [[Canada|Canadian]] cable and satellite providers that carry the WGN-TV Chicago broadcast signal (WGN-TV is [[List of foreign television channels available in Canada#American Superstations eligible for national distribution|authorized]] for carriage in Canada by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]).\n\n==Notable on-air personalities==\n\n===Current personalities===\n*[[Dan Ponce]] \u2013 Co-anchor 4\u20136 a.m.\n* Lauren Jiggetts - Co-anchor 4-6am\n* Morgan Kolkmeyer -  Weather Anchor 4-6am\n*[[Ana Belaval]] \u2013 Interim Co-anchor 4\u20136 a.m.\n* Larry Potash \u2013 Co-anchor 6\u201310 a.m.\n* Robin Baumgarten \u2013 Co-anchor 6\u201310 a.m.\n* Paul Konrad \u2013 Weather Anchor 6\u201310 a.m.\n* Pat Tomasulo \u2013 Sports Reporter 6\u201310 a.m.\n*[[Dean Richards (reporter)|Dean Richards]] \u2013 entertainment reporter\n\n===Former personalities===\n* [[Mike Barz]] \u2013 sports anchor (now at [[WISH-TV]])\n* [[Randy Salerno]] \u2013 reporter/substitute anchor (later at [[WBBM-TV]] in Chicago, died in 2008)\n* [[Roseanne Tellez]] \u2013 co-anchor (later at [[ WBBM-TV]] now co-anchor at [[WFLD]])\n* [[Bill Weir]] \u2013 sports anchor\n* [http://www.mpr.org/about/people/phuttner@mpr.org/2 Paul Huttner] - meteorologist (now Chief Meteorologist at [http://www.mprnews.org/ Minnesota Public Radio])\n* Valerie Warner (now on WLS-TV's \"Windy City Live\")\n\n==See also==\n*''[[KTLA Morning News]]'' - a morning news and entertainment program on sister station [[KTLA]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.WGNMorningNews.com/ Official page]\n\n{{Tribune Media Company}}\n{{NXST TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wgn Morning News}}\n[[Category:Local news programming in the United States]]\n[[Category:1994 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:WGN America original programming]]\n", "name_user": "RunTheGauntlet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correcting spelling error [Typo Team]", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN_Morning_News"}
