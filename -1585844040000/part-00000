They were cleared when two judges instructed not-guilty verdicts. Judge Friedman's memorandum to opposing attorneys reads, \"Whether acts&nbsp;... are lewd and dissolute depends not on any individual's interpretation or personal opinion, but on the consensus of the entire community&nbsp;...\" Doda and del Prete were arrested during police raids to stop ''bare-bosom'' shows in North Beach.<ref>\"Topless Suits in Shows OK\", ''Los Angeles Times'', May 8, 1965, Page 9.</ref> Peter Mattioli owned the Condor Club by 1967 and Doda still appeared in shows there.<ref>\"S.F.

The defendants were dancers at the Pink Pussy Kat in [[Orangevale, California]]. Presiding Municipal Court Judge Earl Warren Jr. moved the trial, temporarily, from the courtroom to Chuck Landis Largo club. There Doda performed to live song and dance numbers, along with a movie titled ''Guru You''. She was cross-examined by a deputy district attorney about what she hoped to convey to audiences in her act. Doda was dressed in a red miniskirt with dark blue [[piping (sewing)|piping]] and beige boots. She responded that the movie represents \"a satire of pornography&nbsp;... it's to show people the humorous side of sex\". Several members of the 10-man, 2-woman jury kept in check their smiles as Doda explained the 17-minute movie. The deputy district attorney opposed asking her to perform, considering it irrelevant to the case. He was overruled by Warren.<ref>\"Judge Takes Another Look At 'Dodo's Indecent Dance'\", ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'', September 23, 1969, Page 32.</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n\nFrom the late-1960s through the late-1970s, Doda was the spokesmodel for what is now the [[San Jose, California]] television station [[KICU-TV]] Channel 36, then known as KGSC-TV.  Filmed from the waist up and wearing clothes which amplified her most prominent physical attributes, she would coo \"You're watching the [[Bust/waist/hip measurements|Perfect 36]] in San Jose.\"  She would also occasionally appear on-air to do a [[double entendre]] laced editorial commentary on the issues of the day.<ref name = \"Tribune 1974\">{{cite news | title = What's Cooking At Francesco's | work = Oakland Tribune | page = 18\u2013E | date = December 14, 1974}} \"Carol Doda; the Perfect 36 (Channel 36's editorial voice and figure) has been in for dinner several times recently.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1982 Doda was again dancing at the Condor three times a night. She was 45 and performed to rock 'n' roll, blues, and ragtime. Each act was the same, with Doda appearing in a gold gown, traditional elbow-length gloves, and a [[Transparency and translucency|diaphanous]] wraparound. Her clothing was removed until she wore only a [[g-string]] and the diaphanous wraparound. In the final portion she was attired in only the wraparound. Her small body looked slimmer without clothes, a perception which was emphasized by the dwarfing effect of her breasts. At the time she was taking dance and voice lessons but had no definite plans for her future.<ref name=silicon/>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Doda performed throughout Bay Area dance night clubs with her band The Lucky Stiffs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wagner |first1=Paul |title=Carol Doda Rocks |work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] |date=22 January 1988}}</ref><ref name=legendary/>\n\nDoda retired from stripping in the 1980s and subsequently ran Carol Doda's Champagne and Lace Lingerie Boutique, a [[lingerie]] shop in San Francisco.<ref name=hankhyena>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Voluminous-Femininity-Bra-shopping-at-Carol-2910080.php | title=Voluminous Femininity / Bra shopping at Carol Doda's boutique|first=Hank|last= Hyena | work=San Francisco Chronicle|date= September 7, 1999|accessdate= November 12, 2015| archivedate= November 2, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102233802/http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Voluminous-Femininity-Bra-shopping-at-Carol-2910080.php | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2009, one could be sure to find Doda on any given evening at Gino & Carlo bar in North Beach.

They were cleared when two judges instructed not-guilty verdicts. Judge Friedman's memorandum to opposing attorneys reads, \"Whether acts&nbsp;... are lewd and dissolute depends not on any individual's interpretation or personal opinion, but on the consensus of the entire community&nbsp;...\" Doda and del Prete were arrested during police raids to stop ''bare-bosom'' shows in North Beach.<ref>\"Topless Suits in Shows OK\", ''Los Angeles Times'', May 8, 1965, Page 9.</ref> Peter Mattioli owned the Condor Club by 1967 and Doda still appeared in shows there.<ref>\"S.F.

The defendants were dancers at the Pink Pussy Kat in [[Orangevale, California]]. Presiding Municipal Court Judge Earl Warren Jr. moved the trial, temporarily, from the courtroom to Chuck Landis Largo club. There Doda performed to live song and dance numbers, along with a movie titled ''Guru You''. She was cross-examined by a deputy district attorney about what she hoped to convey to audiences in her act. Doda was dressed in a red miniskirt with dark blue [[piping (sewing)|piping]] and beige boots. She responded that the movie represents \"a satire of pornography&nbsp;... it's to show people the humorous side of sex\". Several members of the 10-man, 2-woman jury kept in check their smiles as Doda explained the 17-minute movie. The deputy district attorney opposed asking her to perform, considering it irrelevant to the case. He was overruled by Warren.<ref>\"Judge Takes Another Look At 'Dodo's Indecent Dance'\", ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'', September 23, 1969, Page 32.</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n\nFrom the late-1960s through the late-1970s, Doda was the spokesmodel for what is now the [[San Jose, California]] television station [[KICU-TV]] Channel 36, then known as KGSC-TV.  Filmed from the waist up and wearing clothes which amplified her most prominent physical attributes, she would coo \"You're watching the [[Bust/waist/hip measurements|Perfect 36]] in San Jose.\"  She would also occasionally appear on-air to do a [[double entendre]] laced editorial commentary on the issues of the day.<ref name = \"Tribune 1974\">{{cite news | title = What's Cooking At Francesco's | work = Oakland Tribune | page = 18\u2013E | date = December 14, 1974}} \"Carol Doda; the Perfect 36 (Channel 36's editorial voice and figure) has been in for dinner several times recently.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1982 Doda was again dancing at the Condor three times a night. She was 45 and performed to rock 'n' roll, blues, and ragtime. Each act was the same, with Doda appearing in a gold gown, traditional elbow-length gloves, and a [[Transparency and translucency|diaphanous]] wraparound. Her clothing was removed until she wore only a [[g-string]] and the diaphanous wraparound. In the final portion she was attired in only the wraparound. Her small body looked slimmer without clothes, a perception which was emphasized by the dwarfing effect of her breasts. At the time she was taking dance and voice lessons but had no definite plans for her future.<ref name=silicon/>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Doda performed throughout Bay Area dance night clubs with her band The Lucky Stiffs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wagner |first1=Paul |title=Carol Doda Rocks |work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] |date=22 January 1988}}</ref><ref name=legendary/>\n\nDoda retired from stripping in the 1980s and subsequently ran Carol Doda's Champagne and Lace Lingerie Boutique, a [[lingerie]] shop in San Francisco.<ref name=hankhyena>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Voluminous-Femininity-Bra-shopping-at-Carol-2910080.php | title=Voluminous Femininity / Bra shopping at Carol Doda's boutique|first=Hank|last= Hyena | work=San Francisco Chronicle|date= September 7, 1999|accessdate= November 12, 2015| archivedate= November 2, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102233802/http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Voluminous-Femininity-Bra-shopping-at-Carol-2910080.php | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2009, one could be sure to find Doda on any given evening at Gino & Carlo bar in North Beach.

The present school was formed in 1997 by the amalgamation of the original '''Berkhamsted Grammar School''', founded in 1541 by [[John Incent]], [[Dean of St Paul's|Dean of St Paul's Cathedral]], '''Berkhamsted School for Girls''', established in 1888,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/History |title=History |publisher=Berkhamsted School |date=2014-05-31 |accessdate=2016-10-09}}</ref> and '''Berkhamsted Preparatory School'''. The new merged school was initially called Berkhamsted Collegiate School, but reverted to Berkhamsted School in 2008. In 2011 Berkhamsted School merged with Heatherton House School, a girls' preparatory school in Amersham, to form the Berkhamsted Schools Group. The Group acquired Haresfoot School in Berkhamsted and its on site day nursery in 2012, which became Berkhamsted Pre-Preparatory School for children aged three to seven, and Berkhamsted Day Nursery.\n\nBerkhamsted School is a \"[[Diamond Schools|diamond school]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/History-Prep |title=History |publisher=Berkhamsted School |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809155659/http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/History-Prep |archive-date=9 August 2016 |url-status = dead}}</ref> in which pupils are taught coeducationally in the Pre-Prep School, Prep School and [[Sixth Form]], but independently in the traditional Senior years, between the ages of 11 and 16.  The school has four main sites: the Pre-Prep School, the Prep School, the Castle Street Campus and Kings Road Campus (the latter two being the original boys' and girls' schools respectively).\n\nThe School is noted for its distinctive collegiate and pastoral structure, a varied sporting, outdoor education and cultural co-curricular programme and participation in the life of the local community. Richard Backhouse, previously principal of [[Monkton Combe School]], became Principal of the School in January 2016.\n\n==House system==\nAll Berkhamsted pupils belong to a [[house system|House]] throughout their time at the School.  Each House is run by a House-master supported by several house tutors.  Together they are responsible for providing pastoral support for their pupils and serve as the primary link between parents and the School.  Houses are both physical environments and communities, each forming a distinct entity within the larger organisation of the School itself.  Pupils attend their house for morning and afternoon registration, to play games throughout the day, and for the majority of the administration which governs their time at the School.  They also participate in School events on behalf of their House.\n\n===Senior boys' houses===\n[[File:Berko school, lych gate and chapel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lychgate|Lych gate]] and chapel of the Castle Street Campus (formerly the Boys' School)]]\n[[File:Berkhamsted School Kings Campus.jpg|thumb|right|Kings Campus (formerly the Girls' School)]]\n\n*'''Adders''' was formed in 1915 to accommodate the so-called \"train boys\" who, by nature of their daily commute to school, were often excluded from School activities.  Various explanations have been given for the name 'Adders'. It may be a casual abbreviation of \"the add-on house\", or a contraction of 'Adlebert House', now the Chaplain's residence. However, according to an anecdote current in the 1960s, the boys were asked for suggestions and one proposed the present name (\"Bees\" and \"Swifts\" already existed). On being asked why, he explained, \"Puff adders, sir!\", an allusion to the steam trains on which the pupils travelled. Adders is situated in a separate building next to Newcroft and it takes the ground floor while Fry's house uses the top floor. Current Head of House is Richard Margerison.\n*'''Bartrum''' the newest house, founded in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=School Archive |first1=Berkhamsted |url=http://www.bsarchive.org/the-archive-update/4594642201}}</ref>\n*'''Bees''', dating back to 1897 and situated on Mill Street next to Swifts. Current Head of House is Sarah Bugeja.\n*'''Cox's''', opened in 1958 in response to the growing numbers of day boys.  Named after Cuthbert Cox. Until September 2010, the house occupied a separate building located next to the [[Tesco]] carpark. Cox's moved from its present location to the site of the old swimming pool, sharing with Tilmans. The former Cox's house was renovated into a new Drama Studio. Current Head of House is Jessica Thackaray.\n*'''Fry's''' is named after one of Berkhamsted's most successful Headmasters \u2013 Dr Fry. It is located above Adders. Current Head of House is Dr Andrew Harker.\n*'''Greenes''', found along the Cloisters of the Grass Quad.  The School's association with the Greene family is recognised in its name. Current Head of House is Max Stallard.\n*'''Loxwood''', also found along the Cloisters. This house was named after a former girls' school house. Current Head of House is  Martin Middleton.\n*'''Swifts''', established at the same time as Bees. Current Head of House is Douglas Foster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/staff-list|title=Staff List - Berkhamsted School|work=berkhamstedschool.org|access-date=14 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121115416/http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/staff-list|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n*'''Tilman (formerly Incents)''', until September 2010, was both a boarding and day boy house.  The boarding accommodation is situated along Chesham Road, and is the birthplace of [[Graham Greene]].  The House was named after John Incent, the School's founder and had its main entrance in the cloisters between Loxwood and Greenes. In September 2010, Incents day house closed and was renamed 'Tilman' and moved to a new location on the site of the old swimming pool, sharing the site with Cox's. The former Incents House was renovated into a study for the Headmaster and Deputy Head of Berkhamsted Boys. The boarding house remained unchanged. Current Head of House is Richard Mackay.\nThat at least three of the eight Senior Boys' Houses appear to be named after various fauna was not always intentional.  When Swifts and Bees were formed in 1897, they were to be called 'A' and 'B' respectively, but the former's first House Master considered this dull, naming his House 'Swifts'.  'Bees' is thus [[Phonetics|phonetic]].  'Adders' may be wholly fortuitous; 'Reeves' and 'Hawks', now 6th Form Houses, add to the confusion.  [[Richard Ryve|Richard Reeve]] was the School's first Headmaster; Hawks was named by the apparent \"fauna tradition\" in 1933.\n\n===Senior girls' houses===\n*'''Holme'''\n*'''New Stede''' \n*'''Old Stede''' \n*'''Russell''' \n*'''St David's''' \n*'''Stephenson''', founded in 2017, Stephenson is named in honour of microbiologist and biochemist [[Marjory Stephenson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berkhamsted.com/new-berkhamsted-girls-house-named-after-marjory-stephenson-mbe/|title=New Berkhamsted Girls House named after Marjory Stephenson MBE|date=2017-09-04|website=Berkhamsted|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n*'''Wolstenholme''', founded in 2011, Wolstenholme is named after Sue Wolstenholme who was a school governor for 35 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.donorstrategy.com/berkhamsted/page/suewolstenholme|title=Sue Wolstenholme Retirement Dinner - The Old Berkhamstedians|website=web.donorstrategy.com|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth form houses===\n*'''Ashby''', named after the mother of John Incent's second wife, Katherine. \n*'''Burgh''',  pronounced 'Berg'. \n*'''Churchill''', after [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill]] and formerly girls' boarding accommodation.\n*'''Hawks''', a former junior boys' house, established in 1934. \n*'''Nash''', named after Henry Nash, a founder of Berkhamsted School for Girls.\n*'''Reeves''', named after Richard Reeve and founded as a junior boys' house, along with Hawks.\n*'''St George's''', originally a junior house for the \"train boys\", rather like Adders.\n*'''School''', variously the Headmaster's quarters and a boarding house.\n*'''Spencer''', a new sixth form house introduced in 2009.\n*'''Tudor''', a new sixth form house introduced in 2019.\n\n==History of Berkhamsted School, 1541\u20131996==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Dean Incent House Berkhamsted.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Dean Incent's House as it stands today on the Berkhamsted High Street]]High Clergy of the 16th century frequently distinguished themselves by their furthering of the educational establishment and, in this respect, Berkhamsted owes much to [[John Incent]].  In 1523, he called upon the Brethren of the local Brotherhood of [[St John the Baptist]] to divert the funds they had hitherto donated to the monastic hospital (which had closed) to the Brotherhood House, about which  little is known.  In 1541, however, Incent applied to the King, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], in pursuit of a licence \"to purchase \u00a340 in land by the year,\" and was successful.  Although Incent was [[Berkhamsted]]'s most famous descendant, it is considered an act of great piety that he chose to found a School outside what had become his [[Sphere of Influence]].\n\nBy 1544, Berkhamsted School's first building, now known as 'Old Hall' was complete, later to be described by [[William Camden]] as \"the only structure in Berkhamsted worth a second glance.\"<ref>as cited in Scott Hastie, ''Berkhamsted: An Illustrated History'' (Alpine Press), 120.</ref>  The formal opening is recorded in the Ancient Documents:\n<blockquote>\n''When the building of the said Schoole was thus finished, the Deane sent for the chiefe men of the Towne into the Schoole, where he kneeling downe, gave thanks to Almighty God, which had given him life to see the perfection of that work, which both he, the towne and the country had beene about for the space of 20 years as is manifest by the pmisses.  First he read his licence.  Then he called for Richd Reeve, and placed him in the seate there made for the Schoolemr.  and so did ordaine, make and pnounce him to be the first Master of the said Schoole and after that tooke him by the hand and did give him and his successors for ever possession of the lodgings appteining to that office.  In like manner he placed John Audley to be Usher , and John East to be Chaplen.  This done he did give possession by his deed bearing date the 23 of <!-- immutable date format -->March in the 36 yeare of Henry the 8 to the said [[Richard Ryve|Richd Reeve]] John Audley and John East and their successours for ever, of all the land to the sd Schoole then appointed, which are expressed pticularly in an act of pliamt.  made 2 & 3 Ed 6.  Finally the Deane began TE DEUM LAUDAMUS which being finished with certaine other praiers and ceremonies, the whole Companie did there drink together and so depted.<ref>as cited in B.H. Garnons Williams, ''A History of Berkhamsted School, 1541\u20131972'' (Watson and Viney), 20\u201321.</ref>''\n</blockquote>\n\nYet the legal foundation was not nearly so sound. When Incent died some 18 months later, his entire wealth (over \u00a3330) became the King's, his documents stating that Berkhamsted's founder, a highly educated lawyer, had died [[Intestacy|intestate]].  The authenticity of this claim is rightly questioned: shortly after Incent's death, a complaint was made to the King \"by some evill persons that the Deane had laid to the Schoole more revenues than his licence [\u00a340 annually] did permitt him.\"  Furthermore, Henry VIII stood to gain \u00a3196 and \"a front of pearls\" from the Dean's estate.  However, there had been no formal incorporation of the School, and records suggest that Incent had spent much time since the opening preparing, but not realising, legal protection.  An investigation into the claims that his annual endowment had been exceeded was commissioned and undertaken by John Waterhouse, a favourite not only of the King, but also a confidant of Incent, who had been present at the Opening.  His choice of Commissioner suggests the Foundation still had Royal approval, something that had allowed the School to survive the first attack against it.  The most enduring legacy of the Foundation nonetheless remains the building itself, \"strong and fair\".\n[[File:Berkhamsted School Old Hall.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Old Hall]]\n\n===A Delicate establishment===\nIncent's death, which itself had created a threat to the School, was followed by that of Henry VIII in January 1547.  The [[Chantries Acts|Chantries Act 1546]], which could have jeopardised the post of Chaplain at Berkhamsted, was replaced by new legislation, and the Foundation was declared \"unperfect\".  A Foundation Act was introduced in parliament to settle the various claims to the Incent estate, but only those concerning the most immediate relatives of John.  Thus claims to land of the School's endowment in [[Sparkford]] near [[Winchester]] were made and tried, resulting in significant loss to the School.\n\nAn additional threat came when [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], acting on advice, re-established the School under his own name.  In reality, there was both initial benefit and ultimate disadvantage in this.  Richard Reeve, the first Headmaster, held strict Protestant views, and was dismissed by the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], acting upon [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]'s instructions, in 1555.  He was replaced by William Barker, who no doubt offered an alternative religious policy, for he himself was removed when [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] gained the throne.\n\n===Fulfillment under Saltmarsh and Hunt===\nWilliam Saltmarsh enjoyed a longer Headmastership than either Reeve or Barker.  The latter had appointed Leonard Stepney as Usher, but he lost his post in 1571 on charges of harbouring a Catholic priest.  His successor, John Bristowe, had a still more colourful end, murdered gruesomely in 1597 by a local [[yeoman]].  Although this would no doubt have caused Saltmarsh concern, this was otherwise a most successful period in the history of Berkhamsted School.  Pupil numbers continued to increase, and a handful of Berkhamstedians, as they would become known, achieved notoriety.\n\nBy 1616, some years after Saltmarsh's death, it was written\n<blockquote>\n''Scholae Ludimagister cum 33 annos eidem praefuisset amplam pecuniam testamento suo moriens legavit reficiendis his aedibus<ref>which Williams translates: \"William Saltmarsh, third Headmaster of this School, after presiding over it for 33 years, on his deathbed bequeathed a sum of money sufficient for the repair of this building.\"</ref>''\n</blockquote>\nQuite why the building (by which it is meant Old Hall) had fallen into disrepair under an otherwise successful Headmaster is uncertain, but through his donation Saltmarsh had decisively added himself to Berkhamsted's list of benefactors.\n\nAll available evidence, of which there is admittedly little, suggests that the Hunt years were also successful ones for the School.  His period in the office probably witnessed greater stability in the School than in his personal life \u2013 he was married as many as four times \u2013 and there was praise for his leadership, a former pupil recording \"much reverence and affect\" for Hunt. It also appears that he took as active a part in the life of Berkhamsted as had become and remains a tradition, serving as overseer for the poor and [[Bailiff]] as well as contributing to church funds.  He died in office, aged 70, in 1636.\n\n===Shorter tenures===\nThere were two hereditary Headmasterships in the history of Berkhamsted School, neither of which was successful.  The first was that of Henry Hunt, a graduate of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], who died within six months of succeeding his father; the second was to come in the 19th century.  Hunt's successor, William Pitkin, was not quite the academic of former Berkhamsted days.  Yet he was clearly a prominent member of local society, having served as Member of Parliament for Berkhamsted, and whose descendants included a member of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and [[Oliver Wolcott]], a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  In England, however, the political environment began to take its toll on Berkhamsted.\n\nBerkhamsted, situated along a route between London and the battlefields of the [[English Civil War]], became the subject of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] action to preserve the town.  Pitkin's death is recorded in the parish register of [[Fleet Street]], London in September 1643; in his history, Williams suggests Pitkin may have visited London in an attempt to obtain protection for the School, instead dying of the [[Black Death|Plague]].  He was succeeded by Timothy Taylor, until then Usher, but the conditions of the period deny history any formal details, except that his death in 1648 was probably also a result of Plague.  Ogle (1648\u20131651/2) witnessed local controversy resulting from the Civil War and it was likely that the School's seemingly relentless decline had begun in earnest by the time of his tenure, with student numbers falling from 80 to under 10 over three decades.\n\nSuch was the confusion of the period that it is uncertain whether Peter Berkenhead ever even served as Headmaster, although the weight of evidence suggests that he did (however insignificantly).  This series of less distinguished office-holders is no doubt attributable in part to the Civil War; further, since the value of money had for so long been falling, the annual pay, having been set at the Foundation, was insufficient for such a post by the end of the 17th century.\n\n===The Fossan saga===\nThomas Fossan, a friend of [[Samuel Pepys]], petitioned the [[Charles II of England|King]] for the Berkhamsted job in December 1662.  His motive in doing so is unclear, himself recognising that \"by reason of its small salary\" it was not highly sought, but mostly since, having realised his ambition, Fossan so neglected his duties.  Indeed, such was the strength of feeling judges against Fossan that the very same people who had recommended him in 1662 wrote to the authorities six years later in the name of \"the trust imposed in [them] by the founders of the schoole\" that the Headmaster be removed.  When the charges were put to him (that both he and his Usher had spent much time away from the School, that the boys' knowledge of grammar was minimal and that the townspeople had taken to lodging the scholars in light of the School's failure so to do), Fossan replied that \"he cared not whether he had any scholars or not, for the fewer he had the less trouble he should have.\"  His forced resignation followed shortly after.<ref>Fossan's resignation was written in the most eloquent Latin and read during a ceremony in Old Hall.</ref>\n\n==='So Mean a School'===\nIt is some indication of the extent of Berkhamsted's degeneration under Fossan that his successor, Edmund Newboult, was recommended by the [[Bishop of Hereford]] as \"of parts sufficient for so mean a school,\" an endorsement described as \"comically unenthusiastic\".<ref>Garnons Williams, p. 67</ref>  The most prominent historical source on Newboult remains a reply he made to an educational researcher some years into his tenure, noting that \"Ye Statues of ye Schoole were made in ye time of [[popery]], therefore not observed.\"  During his 17 years of office, Newboult does appear to have provided a solid educational environment at Berkhamsted, at least relatively speaking, something continued under his successor, Thomas Wren.  In his wake came John Theed, member of a prosperous [[Buckinghamshire]] family, and Berkhamsted's longest serving Headmaster.  Indeed, throughout the 18th century, there were to be only four occupants of the post, an age not only of stability but stagnation.  Nonetheless, the three inspections<ref>Incent had invested this responsibility in the warden of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], which he had attended.</ref> carried out during the three years found no cause for concern, and in their record is revealed the first reference to curriculum content, the boys having been examined on [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]].\n\nTheed was the School's second pluralist<ref>A holder of more than one office simultaneously</ref> (it is no inspiration that the first was Fossan): his obituary in [[The Gentleman's Magazine]] recorded him as Vicar of [[Marsworth]] and made no mention of his Berkhamsted role \u2013 some suggest this is characteristic of an insouciant, unambitious approach to the School.  A similar charge could not be made against Evan Price.  Having served as Usher for 16 of Theed's less proactive years, Price had become accustomed to the day-to-day running of the School.  On Theed's death in 1734, his succession, still the jurisdiction of the [[George II of Great Britain|Sovereign]], brought Price to the Headmastership, despite his not having attended university and his flamboyant record \u2013 as [[curate]] of [[Bovingdon]], he had been involved in an \"unseemly brawl\" during a burial he was officiating.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{main|Category:People educated at Berkhamsted School}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Henry Atkins (physician)|Henry Atkins]] (1554/5\u20131635), President of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], 1606\u20131635\n*[[Richard Field (theologian)|Richard Field]] (1561\u20131616), clergyman and [[theologian]]\n*[[Algernon Methuen|Sir Algernon Methuen]] (1856\u20131924), founder and owner, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] & Co, publishers,  1889\u20131924\n*[[Clementine Churchill|Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill]] (1885\u20131977), wife of [[Winston Churchill]]\n*[[Charles Seltman]] (1886-1957), author and archeologist\n*[[Lumley Lyster|Sir Lumley Lyster]] (1888-1957), admiral, Royal Navy \n*[[Clifford Allen, 1st Baron Allen of Hurtwood]] (1889\u20131939), politician and peace campaigner\n*[[Donald Fergusson|Sir Donald Fergusson]] (1891\u20131963), [[Permanent Secretary]], [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries]], 1936\u20131945, and [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]], 1945\u20131952\n*[[Clement Glenister]] (1897\u20131968), cricketer and Royal Navy officer\n*[[H.

The present school was formed in 1997 by the amalgamation of the original '''Berkhamsted Grammar School''', founded in 1541 by [[John Incent]], [[Dean of St Paul's|Dean of St Paul's Cathedral]], '''Berkhamsted School for Girls''', established in 1888,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/History |title=History |publisher=Berkhamsted School |date=2014-05-31 |accessdate=2016-10-09}}</ref> and '''Berkhamsted Preparatory School'''. The new merged school was initially called Berkhamsted Collegiate School, but reverted to Berkhamsted School in 2008. In 2011 Berkhamsted School merged with Heatherton House School, a girls' preparatory school in Amersham, to form the Berkhamsted Schools Group. The Group acquired Haresfoot School in Berkhamsted and its on site day nursery in 2012, which became Berkhamsted Pre-Preparatory School for children aged three to seven, and Berkhamsted Day Nursery.\n\nBerkhamsted School is a \"[[Diamond Schools|diamond school]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/History-Prep |title=History |publisher=Berkhamsted School |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809155659/http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/History-Prep |archive-date=9 August 2016 |url-status = dead}}</ref> in which pupils are taught coeducationally in the Pre-Prep School, Prep School and [[Sixth Form]], but independently in the traditional Senior years, between the ages of 11 and 16.  The school has four main sites: the Pre-Prep School, the Prep School, the Castle Street Campus and Kings Road Campus (the latter two being the original boys' and girls' schools respectively).\n\nThe School is noted for its distinctive collegiate and pastoral structure, a varied sporting, outdoor education and cultural co-curricular programme and participation in the life of the local community. Richard Backhouse, previously principal of [[Monkton Combe School]], became Principal of the School in January 2016.\n\n==House system==\nAll Berkhamsted pupils belong to a [[house system|House]] throughout their time at the School.  Each House is run by a House-master supported by several house tutors.  Together they are responsible for providing pastoral support for their pupils and serve as the primary link between parents and the School.  Houses are both physical environments and communities, each forming a distinct entity within the larger organisation of the School itself.  Pupils attend their house for morning and afternoon registration, to play games throughout the day, and for the majority of the administration which governs their time at the School.  They also participate in School events on behalf of their House.\n\n===Senior boys' houses===\n[[File:Berko school, lych gate and chapel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lychgate|Lych gate]] and chapel of the Castle Street Campus (formerly the Boys' School)]]\n[[File:Berkhamsted School Kings Campus.jpg|thumb|right|Kings Campus (formerly the Girls' School)]]\n\n*'''Adders''' was formed in 1915 to accommodate the so-called \"train boys\" who, by nature of their daily commute to school, were often excluded from School activities.  Various explanations have been given for the name 'Adders'. It may be a casual abbreviation of \"the add-on house\", or a contraction of 'Adlebert House', now the Chaplain's residence. However, according to an anecdote current in the 1960s, the boys were asked for suggestions and one proposed the present name (\"Bees\" and \"Swifts\" already existed). On being asked why, he explained, \"Puff adders, sir!\", an allusion to the steam trains on which the pupils travelled. Adders is situated in a separate building next to Newcroft and it takes the ground floor while Fry's house uses the top floor. Current Head of House is Richard Margerison.\n*'''Bartrum''' the newest house, founded in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=School Archive |first1=Berkhamsted |url=http://www.bsarchive.org/the-archive-update/4594642201}}</ref>\n*'''Bees''', dating back to 1897 and situated on Mill Street next to Swifts. Current Head of House is Sarah Bugeja.\n*'''Cox's''', opened in 1958 in response to the growing numbers of day boys.  Named after Cuthbert Cox. Until September 2010, the house occupied a separate building located next to the [[Tesco]] carpark. Cox's moved from its present location to the site of the old swimming pool, sharing with Tilmans. The former Cox's house was renovated into a new Drama Studio. Current Head of House is Jessica Thackaray.\n*'''Fry's''' is named after one of Berkhamsted's most successful Headmasters \u2013 Dr Fry. It is located above Adders. Current Head of House is Dr Andrew Harker.\n*'''Greenes''', found along the Cloisters of the Grass Quad.  The School's association with the Greene family is recognised in its name. Current Head of House is Max Stallard.\n*'''Loxwood''', also found along the Cloisters. This house was named after a former girls' school house. Current Head of House is  Martin Middleton.\n*'''Swifts''', established at the same time as Bees. Current Head of House is Douglas Foster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/staff-list|title=Staff List - Berkhamsted School|work=berkhamstedschool.org|access-date=14 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121115416/http://www.berkhamstedschool.org/staff-list|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n*'''Tilman (formerly Incents)''', until September 2010, was both a boarding and day boy house.  The boarding accommodation is situated along Chesham Road, and is the birthplace of [[Graham Greene]].  The House was named after John Incent, the School's founder and had its main entrance in the cloisters between Loxwood and Greenes. In September 2010, Incents day house closed and was renamed 'Tilman' and moved to a new location on the site of the old swimming pool, sharing the site with Cox's. The former Incents House was renovated into a study for the Headmaster and Deputy Head of Berkhamsted Boys. The boarding house remained unchanged. Current Head of House is Richard Mackay.\nThat at least three of the eight Senior Boys' Houses appear to be named after various fauna was not always intentional.  When Swifts and Bees were formed in 1897, they were to be called 'A' and 'B' respectively, but the former's first House Master considered this dull, naming his House 'Swifts'.  'Bees' is thus [[Phonetics|phonetic]].  'Adders' may be wholly fortuitous; 'Reeves' and 'Hawks', now 6th Form Houses, add to the confusion.  [[Richard Ryve|Richard Reeve]] was the School's first Headmaster; Hawks was named by the apparent \"fauna tradition\" in 1933.\n\n===Senior girls' houses===\n*'''Holme'''\n*'''New Stede''' \n*'''Old Stede''' \n*'''Russell''' \n*'''St David's''' \n*'''Stephenson''', founded in 2017, Stephenson is named in honour of microbiologist and biochemist [[Marjory Stephenson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berkhamsted.com/new-berkhamsted-girls-house-named-after-marjory-stephenson-mbe/|title=New Berkhamsted Girls House named after Marjory Stephenson MBE|date=2017-09-04|website=Berkhamsted|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n*'''Wolstenholme''', founded in 2011, Wolstenholme is named after Sue Wolstenholme who was a school governor for 35 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.donorstrategy.com/berkhamsted/page/suewolstenholme|title=Sue Wolstenholme Retirement Dinner - The Old Berkhamstedians|website=web.donorstrategy.com|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth form houses===\n*'''Ashby''', named after the mother of John Incent's second wife, Katherine. \n*'''Burgh''',  pronounced 'Berg'. \n*'''Churchill''', after [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill]] and formerly girls' boarding accommodation.\n*'''Hawks''', a former junior boys' house, established in 1934. \n*'''Nash''', named after Henry Nash, a founder of Berkhamsted School for Girls.\n*'''Reeves''', named after Richard Reeve and founded as a junior boys' house, along with Hawks.\n*'''St George's''', originally a junior house for the \"train boys\", rather like Adders.\n*'''School''', variously the Headmaster's quarters and a boarding house.\n*'''Spencer''', a new sixth form house introduced in 2009.\n*'''Tudor''', a new sixth form house introduced in 2019.\n\n==History of Berkhamsted School, 1541\u20131996==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Dean Incent House Berkhamsted.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Dean Incent's House as it stands today on the Berkhamsted High Street]]High Clergy of the 16th century frequently distinguished themselves by their furthering of the educational establishment and, in this respect, Berkhamsted owes much to [[John Incent]].  In 1523, he called upon the Brethren of the local Brotherhood of [[St John the Baptist]] to divert the funds they had hitherto donated to the monastic hospital (which had closed) to the Brotherhood House, about which  little is known.  In 1541, however, Incent applied to the King, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], in pursuit of a licence \"to purchase \u00a340 in land by the year,\" and was successful.  Although Incent was [[Berkhamsted]]'s most famous descendant, it is considered an act of great piety that he chose to found a School outside what had become his [[Sphere of Influence]].\n\nBy 1544, Berkhamsted School's first building, now known as 'Old Hall' was complete, later to be described by [[William Camden]] as \"the only structure in Berkhamsted worth a second glance.\"<ref>as cited in Scott Hastie, ''Berkhamsted: An Illustrated History'' (Alpine Press), 120.</ref>  The formal opening is recorded in the Ancient Documents:\n<blockquote>\n''When the building of the said Schoole was thus finished, the Deane sent for the chiefe men of the Towne into the Schoole, where he kneeling downe, gave thanks to Almighty God, which had given him life to see the perfection of that work, which both he, the towne and the country had beene about for the space of 20 years as is manifest by the pmisses.  First he read his licence.  Then he called for Richd Reeve, and placed him in the seate there made for the Schoolemr.  and so did ordaine, make and pnounce him to be the first Master of the said Schoole and after that tooke him by the hand and did give him and his successors for ever possession of the lodgings appteining to that office.  In like manner he placed John Audley to be Usher , and John East to be Chaplen.  This done he did give possession by his deed bearing date the 23 of <!-- immutable date format -->March in the 36 yeare of Henry the 8 to the said [[Richard Ryve|Richd Reeve]] John Audley and John East and their successours for ever, of all the land to the sd Schoole then appointed, which are expressed pticularly in an act of pliamt.  made 2 & 3 Ed 6.  Finally the Deane began TE DEUM LAUDAMUS which being finished with certaine other praiers and ceremonies, the whole Companie did there drink together and so depted.<ref>as cited in B.H. Garnons Williams, ''A History of Berkhamsted School, 1541\u20131972'' (Watson and Viney), 20\u201321.</ref>''\n</blockquote>\n\nYet the legal foundation was not nearly so sound. When Incent died some 18 months later, his entire wealth (over \u00a3330) became the King's, his documents stating that Berkhamsted's founder, a highly educated lawyer, had died [[Intestacy|intestate]].  The authenticity of this claim is rightly questioned: shortly after Incent's death, a complaint was made to the King \"by some evill persons that the Deane had laid to the Schoole more revenues than his licence [\u00a340 annually] did permitt him.\"  Furthermore, Henry VIII stood to gain \u00a3196 and \"a front of pearls\" from the Dean's estate.  However, there had been no formal incorporation of the School, and records suggest that Incent had spent much time since the opening preparing, but not realising, legal protection.  An investigation into the claims that his annual endowment had been exceeded was commissioned and undertaken by John Waterhouse, a favourite not only of the King, but also a confidant of Incent, who had been present at the Opening.  His choice of Commissioner suggests the Foundation still had Royal approval, something that had allowed the School to survive the first attack against it.  The most enduring legacy of the Foundation nonetheless remains the building itself, \"strong and fair\".\n[[File:Berkhamsted School Old Hall.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Old Hall]]\n\n===A Delicate establishment===\nIncent's death, which itself had created a threat to the School, was followed by that of Henry VIII in January 1547.  The [[Chantries Acts|Chantries Act 1546]], which could have jeopardised the post of Chaplain at Berkhamsted, was replaced by new legislation, and the Foundation was declared \"unperfect\".  A Foundation Act was introduced in parliament to settle the various claims to the Incent estate, but only those concerning the most immediate relatives of John.  Thus claims to land of the School's endowment in [[Sparkford]] near [[Winchester]] were made and tried, resulting in significant loss to the School.\n\nAn additional threat came when [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], acting on advice, re-established the School under his own name.  In reality, there was both initial benefit and ultimate disadvantage in this.  Richard Reeve, the first Headmaster, held strict Protestant views, and was dismissed by the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], acting upon [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]'s instructions, in 1555.  He was replaced by William Barker, who no doubt offered an alternative religious policy, for he himself was removed when [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] gained the throne.\n\n===Fulfillment under Saltmarsh and Hunt===\nWilliam Saltmarsh enjoyed a longer Headmastership than either Reeve or Barker.  The latter had appointed Leonard Stepney as Usher, but he lost his post in 1571 on charges of harbouring a Catholic priest.  His successor, John Bristowe, had a still more colourful end, murdered gruesomely in 1597 by a local [[yeoman]].  Although this would no doubt have caused Saltmarsh concern, this was otherwise a most successful period in the history of Berkhamsted School.  Pupil numbers continued to increase, and a handful of Berkhamstedians, as they would become known, achieved notoriety.\n\nBy 1616, some years after Saltmarsh's death, it was written\n<blockquote>\n''Scholae Ludimagister cum 33 annos eidem praefuisset amplam pecuniam testamento suo moriens legavit reficiendis his aedibus<ref>which Williams translates: \"William Saltmarsh, third Headmaster of this School, after presiding over it for 33 years, on his deathbed bequeathed a sum of money sufficient for the repair of this building.\"</ref>''\n</blockquote>\nQuite why the building (by which it is meant Old Hall) had fallen into disrepair under an otherwise successful Headmaster is uncertain, but through his donation Saltmarsh had decisively added himself to Berkhamsted's list of benefactors.\n\nAll available evidence, of which there is admittedly little, suggests that the Hunt years were also successful ones for the School.  His period in the office probably witnessed greater stability in the School than in his personal life \u2013 he was married as many as four times \u2013 and there was praise for his leadership, a former pupil recording \"much reverence and affect\" for Hunt. It also appears that he took as active a part in the life of Berkhamsted as had become and remains a tradition, serving as overseer for the poor and [[Bailiff]] as well as contributing to church funds.  He died in office, aged 70, in 1636.\n\n===Shorter tenures===\nThere were two hereditary Headmasterships in the history of Berkhamsted School, neither of which was successful.  The first was that of Henry Hunt, a graduate of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], who died within six months of succeeding his father; the second was to come in the 19th century.  Hunt's successor, William Pitkin, was not quite the academic of former Berkhamsted days.  Yet he was clearly a prominent member of local society, having served as Member of Parliament for Berkhamsted, and whose descendants included a member of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and [[Oliver Wolcott]], a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  In England, however, the political environment began to take its toll on Berkhamsted.\n\nBerkhamsted, situated along a route between London and the battlefields of the [[English Civil War]], became the subject of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] action to preserve the town.  Pitkin's death is recorded in the parish register of [[Fleet Street]], London in September 1643; in his history, Williams suggests Pitkin may have visited London in an attempt to obtain protection for the School, instead dying of the [[Black Death|Plague]].  He was succeeded by Timothy Taylor, until then Usher, but the conditions of the period deny history any formal details, except that his death in 1648 was probably also a result of Plague.  Ogle (1648\u20131651/2) witnessed local controversy resulting from the Civil War and it was likely that the School's seemingly relentless decline had begun in earnest by the time of his tenure, with student numbers falling from 80 to under 10 over three decades.\n\nSuch was the confusion of the period that it is uncertain whether Peter Berkenhead ever even served as Headmaster, although the weight of evidence suggests that he did (however insignificantly).  This series of less distinguished office-holders is no doubt attributable in part to the Civil War; further, since the value of money had for so long been falling, the annual pay, having been set at the Foundation, was insufficient for such a post by the end of the 17th century.\n\n===The Fossan saga===\nThomas Fossan, a friend of [[Samuel Pepys]], petitioned the [[Charles II of England|King]] for the Berkhamsted job in December 1662.  His motive in doing so is unclear, himself recognising that \"by reason of its small salary\" it was not highly sought, but mostly since, having realised his ambition, Fossan so neglected his duties.  Indeed, such was the strength of feeling judges against Fossan that the very same people who had recommended him in 1662 wrote to the authorities six years later in the name of \"the trust imposed in [them] by the founders of the schoole\" that the Headmaster be removed.  When the charges were put to him (that both he and his Usher had spent much time away from the School, that the boys' knowledge of grammar was minimal and that the townspeople had taken to lodging the scholars in light of the School's failure so to do), Fossan replied that \"he cared not whether he had any scholars or not, for the fewer he had the less trouble he should have.\"  His forced resignation followed shortly after.<ref>Fossan's resignation was written in the most eloquent Latin and read during a ceremony in Old Hall.</ref>\n\n==='So Mean a School'===\nIt is some indication of the extent of Berkhamsted's degeneration under Fossan that his successor, Edmund Newboult, was recommended by the [[Bishop of Hereford]] as \"of parts sufficient for so mean a school,\" an endorsement described as \"comically unenthusiastic\".<ref>Garnons Williams, p. 67</ref>  The most prominent historical source on Newboult remains a reply he made to an educational researcher some years into his tenure, noting that \"Ye Statues of ye Schoole were made in ye time of [[popery]], therefore not observed.\"  During his 17 years of office, Newboult does appear to have provided a solid educational environment at Berkhamsted, at least relatively speaking, something continued under his successor, Thomas Wren.  In his wake came John Theed, member of a prosperous [[Buckinghamshire]] family, and Berkhamsted's longest serving Headmaster.  Indeed, throughout the 18th century, there were to be only four occupants of the post, an age not only of stability but stagnation.  Nonetheless, the three inspections<ref>Incent had invested this responsibility in the warden of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], which he had attended.</ref> carried out during the three years found no cause for concern, and in their record is revealed the first reference to curriculum content, the boys having been examined on [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]].\n\nTheed was the School's second pluralist<ref>A holder of more than one office simultaneously</ref> (it is no inspiration that the first was Fossan): his obituary in [[The Gentleman's Magazine]] recorded him as Vicar of [[Marsworth]] and made no mention of his Berkhamsted role \u2013 some suggest this is characteristic of an insouciant, unambitious approach to the School.  A similar charge could not be made against Evan Price.  Having served as Usher for 16 of Theed's less proactive years, Price had become accustomed to the day-to-day running of the School.  On Theed's death in 1734, his succession, still the jurisdiction of the [[George II of Great Britain|Sovereign]], brought Price to the Headmastership, despite his not having attended university and his flamboyant record \u2013 as [[curate]] of [[Bovingdon]], he had been involved in an \"unseemly brawl\" during a burial he was officiating.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{main|Category:People educated at Berkhamsted School}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Henry Atkins (physician)|Henry Atkins]] (1554/5\u20131635), President of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], 1606\u20131635\n*[[Richard Field (theologian)|Richard Field]] (1561\u20131616), clergyman and [[theologian]]\n*[[Algernon Methuen|Sir Algernon Methuen]] (1856\u20131924), founder and owner, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] & Co, publishers,  1889\u20131924\n*[[Clementine Churchill|Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill]] (1885\u20131977), wife of [[Winston Churchill]]\n*[[Charles Seltman]] (1886-1957), author and archeologist\n*[[Lumley Lyster|Sir Lumley Lyster]] (1888-1957), admiral, Royal Navy \n*[[Clifford Allen, 1st Baron Allen of Hurtwood]] (1889\u20131939), politician and peace campaigner\n*[[Donald Fergusson|Sir Donald Fergusson]] (1891\u20131963), [[Permanent Secretary]], [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries]], 1936\u20131945, and [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]], 1945\u20131952\n*[[Clement Glenister]] (1897\u20131968), cricketer and Royal Navy officer\n*[[H.

He is best known as a founding member and the lead vocalist of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and has appeared on every album released by the band. Kiedis and his fellow band members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012.\n\nKiedis spent his youth in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] with his mother, then moved shortly before his twelfth birthday to live with his father in Hollywood. While attending [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]], Kiedis developed close friendships with fellow students [[Flea (musician)|Michael Balzary]] (later known as Flea) and [[Hillel Slovak]], who at the time were members of a band called [[Anthym]]. After high school, Kiedis began taking classes at [[UCLA]], but dropped out early in his sophomore year.\n\nHe later received an offer to be the opening act for a local band, and enlisted [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Hillel Slovak|Slovak]], and drummer [[Jack Irons]] to assist. After a show under the name ''\"Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem\"'', the band progressed and the line-up eventually became the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nHe has recorded eleven studio albums with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Kiedis' lyrical style has evolved throughout his career; early recordings discussed topics such as sex and life in Los Angeles, while more recent songs focus on more reflective themes including love, addiction, and loss. Additionally, his vocal style has shifted from [[rapping]] to more conventional singing. He struggled with addiction for the majority of his life up until the year 2000 and has since remained drug free.\n\n==Early life==\nKiedis was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Margaret \"Peggy\" (Noble) and actor John Michael Kiedis, known professionally as Blackie Dammett.<ref name=\"Kiedis, Anthony 2004 39\">Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 39</ref> His paternal grandfather's family emigrated from [[Lithuania]] in the early 1900s; the remainder of his ancestry includes Irish, English, French and Dutch.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, p. 9</ref> In 1966, when he was three years old, his parents divorced and he was then raised by his mother in Grand Rapids. His mother later remarried and had two more children, Anthony's half sisters.<ref name=\"Kiedis14\">Kiedis, Sloman, p. 14</ref> Each summer, he would visit his father in Hollywood for two weeks, a time during which the two would bond.

However, he soon met [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], and after a brief confrontation, the two became best friends and bonded while sitting next to each other in [[driver's ed]] class.<ref name=VH1behindthemusic/><ref name=apterpg34>Apter, 2004. p. 34</ref> Kiedis recalled, \"We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief, love, and The Grateful Dead.

At age 15, Kiedis broke his back attempting to jump into a swimming pool from a five-story building, missing the pool by a few inches.<ref name=\"Kiedis, Anthony 2004 p. 96\">Kiedis, Sloman. (2004).

Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography ''[[Scar Tissue (book)|Scar Tissue]]'': \"Within a few minutes of hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people I'd spent time with...He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting.\"<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, p. 64.</ref> Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea became best friends and often used [[LSD]], heroin, [[cocaine]], and [[Amphetamine|speed]] recreationally.<ref name=apterpgs40>Apter, 2004. p. 40</ref> Despite his frequent drug use, he excelled in school, often receiving straight A grades.<ref name=\"Kiedis, Anthony 2004 39\"/> In June 1980, Kiedis graduated with honors from high school.

Irons and [[Hillel Slovak]] had begun playing together in high school while performing in a band called Chain Reaction. The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chilean-born vocalist and guitarist [[Alain Johannes]]. With Strasman set on becoming a lawyer, he quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college. At this point, Flea was brought into the mix. Shortly after hanging out with the band, and attending a few shows, Kiedis was offered a position in the band by Flea. He began as a \"hype man\", going out in front of the band blurting out jokes to the audience and getting them pumped up. \"<ref>Thompson, Dave. \"Footnote Archives: What Is This Pre-Chili Peppers Anthym?\" Proquest.

Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]''. Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal \"literally asleep\".<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 191</ref> He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo [[drug rehabilitation]]. During that time, the band won the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey. He visited his mother in [[Michigan]] for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 193</ref> Kiedis checked into a [[Salvation Army]] rehabilitation clinic in [[Grand Rapids]], an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him.

The band hired guitarist [[Arik Marshall]] to complete the remaining tour dates.

The tour to support the album was also met with mixed results. Chad Smith broke his arm prior to the launch of the U.S. tour in 1995 so it was delayed until early 1996. Near the tour's end, Kiedis was involved in a motorcycle accident which left him with a broken arm. The tour ended with the band's final set being cut short due to a massive typhoon. 1997 was dubbed by the band the year of nothing.\n\n===1998\u20132010: ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' and ''Stadium Arcadium''===\nThe band regrouped in 1998 to begin writing for their seventh studio album; however, Navarro was now battling his own drug problems.

Kiedis had a brief relationship in 1990 with singer [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] who inspired him to write \"I Could Have Lied\" on 1991's ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' while a brief fling with [[Spice Girls]] singer [[Melanie Chisholm|Melanie \"Sporty Spice\" Chisholm]] inspired \"Emit Remmus\" from 1999's ''Californication''. [[Yohanna Logan]], with whom Kiedis dated on and off from 1998\u20132003, served as a positive inspiration on songs from the ''Californication'' era such as the outtake \"Fat Dance\" while their breakup inspired 2002's ''By the Way'' album and many of its song lyrics.\n\nA failed two-year relationship with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, who was 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as a major influence on his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, ''The Getaway'' which often had Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. \"Lyrically, I'm embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship was a bit of a disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,\" Kiedis said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/melbourne-model-helena-vestergaard-declares-love-for-red-hot-chili-peppers-frontman-anthony-kiedis/story-e6frfmq9-1226733464104|title=Melbourne model Helena Vestergaard declares love for Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis|date=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/red-hot-chili-peppers-anthony-kiedis-relationship-disaster-inspired-new-album/|title=Anthony Kiedis: Relationship 'Disaster' Inspired New Album}}</ref>\n\nIn a June 2016 interview, Kiedis opened up about his past relationships saying that there were years when he had over 100 sexual partners and stated \"If I saw a pretty girl, I wanted to have her.\" When asked about marriage and growing old and alone Kiedis responded by saying \"Maybe it is because I never learned to live in a relationship and as silly as it sounds, I do not understand women yet.

A few years into the band's career, he was briefly fired due to his heavy drug use, and at times it got so bad that he failed to show up to some of the band's performances. One night, Kiedis decided to go out and score drugs, which made him miss a performance so the band replaced him with singer [[Keith Morris]].\n\nHe tried to get clean after Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] died of a heroin overdose while [[speedball (drug)|speedballing]] on June 25, 1988, saying he would never shoot up again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stadium-arcadium.com/main/biography-anthony-kiedis.php |title=Anthony Kiedis Biography |publisher=Stadium-Arcadium.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930025706/http://www.stadium-arcadium.com/main/biography-anthony-kiedis.php |archivedate=September 30, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He entered [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] and ended up staying clean for five years, but he relapsed in 1994, causing a major delay in the release of the band's 1995 album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', and he kept using on and off over the next six years.\n\nThe last major relapse was instigated by a doctor prescribing him [[Ultram]] despite Kiedis specifically asking for drugs that are not in the opiate family. To a recovering heroin addict, the synthetic opiate gives rise to strong cravings. He has reportedly avoided another relapse since December 24, 2000. \"It's easy to be a junkie, but it's not easy to be one of the best guitarists or songwriters of all time\", Kiedis said, referring to [[John Frusciante]], in the March 2007 issue of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first= Chris | last= Norris | title= ''Anthony Kiedis: The Pursuit of Happiness'' | date= March 2007 | work= Blender Magazine | url= http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2486&src=GM7070:MD | accessdate= February 13, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210204108/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2486&src=GM7070:MD | archive-date= December 10, 2007 | url-status= dead | df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Bandhistory\">{{cite book |url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=10318139705&searchurl=bsi%3D0%26ds%3D30%26isbn%3D0316726729 |last1=Kiedis |first1=Anthony |authorlink1=Anthony Kiedis |last2=Sloman |first2=Larry |title=Scar Tissue |publisher=[[Time Warner]] Books |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-316-72672-9 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref> In May 2012 after over twenty years of speculation ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'' stated that the location where Kiedis would purchase and use drugs which inspired \"[[Under the Bridge]]\" is located in [[MacArthur Park]] in Los Angeles, California, based on clues taken from Kiedis' memoir.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/report-bridge-from-chili-peppers-under-the-bridge-identified-in-l-a-20120525 |title=Report: Bridge from Chili Peppers' 'Under the Bridge' Identified in L.A. &#124; Music News |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> In 2014, LA Weekly strongly asserted that the conclusion of the Vulture Magazine piece is not correct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-red-hot-chili-peppers-bridge-is-not-where-you-think-it-is-an-investigation-5279185 |title=Report: The Red Hot Chili Peppers' Bridge Is Not Where You Think It Is: An Investigation |publisher=LA Weekly |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Feud with Mike Patton==\n{{fanpov|date=November 2019}}\nFor over 30 years, Kiedis and [[Faith No More]]/[[Mr. Bungle]] singer [[Mike Patton]] have been involved in an ongoing feud.

However, things turned ugly between the two in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement Patton of imitating his style on stage and in their music video for their biggest hit \"[[Epic (Faith No More song)|Epic]]\" (from 1989's follow up to ''Introduce Yourself'', ''[[The Real Thing (Faith No More album)|The Real Thing]])''. Kiedis stated \"I watched [their] \"Epic\" video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it looked like I was looking in a mirror. I love ''The Real Thing'', and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?'\".<ref name=\"MrBungleFAQ\"/> The feud between the two was reignited in 1999 when Mr. Bungle was scheduled to release their album ''[[California (Mr. Bungle album)|California]]'' on June 8, 1999 but [[Warner Bros.

We found out it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so our manager called their manager to find out what the hell was going on, and their manager was very apologetic, and said, 'We're really sorry, we want you to know this doesn't reflect the management's position, or the band's for that matter.

Mr. Bungle also satirized many of the mannerisms of the band, mocking heroin injections, deceased guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], and on-stage antics. Kiedis responded by having them removed from the 2000 [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Kiedis said of the festival shows, \"I would not have given two fucks if they played there with us.

Patton said, \"It's not worth talking about. I've no idea what it was about then and I don't know now. But I bet we'd have a warm embrace if we saw each other now.\" In 2016, Trey Spruance reflected on the Mr. Bungle feud, stating that it was a \"weird and unprofessional jealous vendetta from a huge successful band towards an industry pip-squeak.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2016/11/trey-spruance-halloween-interview.html|title=TREY SPRUANCE HALLOWEEN INTERVIEW|website=faithnomorefollowers.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[Fox News]] host [[Greg Gutfeld]] injected himself into the Chili Peppers/Patton feud, taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and [[Koko the gorilla]]. Gutfeld said, \"As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More. Don't ever forget it.\" After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying, \"Two days ago, I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I received a lot of flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [are] the worst band in the universe. I'd like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain that we live in a binary universe,\" he continued. \"You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/08/fox-news-continues-its-vicious-assault-against-red-hot-chili-peppers/|title=Fox News continues its vicious assault against Red Hot Chili Peppers|date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying, \"I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us.

His first musical memory was hearing [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" at age eleven: \"It moved me so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45.\"<ref name=\"Mullen116\">Mullen, 2010. p. 116</ref> In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]'s \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" and the \"in-your-face sexual lyrics\" of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s \"[[Dirty Mind (Prince song)|Dirty Mind]]\".<ref name=\"Mullen78\">Mullen, 2010. p. 78</ref> Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' album, [[John Frusciante]] and Flea have written nearly all of the music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, \"Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they're doing.\" His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of [[Charles Bukowski]], Kiedis' main literary influence.<ref name=\"Bandhistory\"/>\n\nHis early vocal style with the band primarily consisted of [[rapping]]. On ''Mother's Milk'' (1989), Kiedis wrote more melody-driven songs, rather than the basic rhythm and beat style of [[funk]]. The first song where Kiedis employed his new melodic style was \"[[Knock Me Down]]\". The melody was actually shaped and performed by guitarist John Frusciante. Upon joining the band, Frusciante sang lead vocals on the song along with Kiedis. ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' in 1991 still saw Kiedis rapping, but he also started singing in songs such as \"[[Under the Bridge]]\", \"[[Breaking the Girl]]\", and \"I Could Have Lied\". Over the years, Kiedis grew to favor singing over rapping. Kiedis has had many [[vocal coaches]], but none of them had helped him sing \"well.\" In fact, it was not until 1999's ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' that he felt he could take full control of his voice while singing.<ref name=\"Bandhistory\"/>\n\n===''Scar Tissue''===\nOn October 6, 2004, Kiedis published a memoir titled ''[[Scar Tissue (book)|Scar Tissue]]'', which he co-wrote with author [[Larry Sloman]]. The book was originally intended to be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography.<ref name=\"Memoir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1492057/anthony-kiedis-scary-past-revealed-book.jhtml|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=For Anthony Kiedis, What Doesn't Kill You Only Makes Your Book Longer|date=October 7, 2004|accessdate=December 7, 2011|publisher=MTV News}}</ref> He further explained: \"One would just kind of assume that with all the [drug] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy. But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents', or any of my friends'. My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, 'Wow, I don't ... were we there?'\"<ref name=\"Memoir\"/> The book was an international bestseller.<ref>Front cover of Scar Tissue</ref>\n\nIn a June 2016 interview, Kiedis stated that he at first regretted writing ''Scar Tissue'' saying \"I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused\u2014then, I started seeing the long term positive reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools, and it was having a positive effect. I realised that the whole point of writing that book wasn't for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.\" Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. \"I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.\" Kiedis said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/red-hot-chili-peppers/news/anthony-kiedis-i-regretted-memoir-but-it-had-a-positive-effect_5297245|title=Anthony Kiedis: &#039;I Regretted Memoir But It Had A Positive Effect&#039;|date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Potential television series===\nKiedis was developing a series for [[HBO]] based on his unconventional upbringing in Los Angeles. The show was expected to be loosely based on much of Kiedis' autobiography. He had partnered with Catapult 360 partners Marc Abrams and [[Mike Benson (screenwriter)|Michael Benson]] to create the series, titled ''Spider and Son''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laudadio |first=Marisa |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20274341,00.html |title=Anthony Kiedis's Red-Hot Roommate?

John Sayles, who wrote a script for the HBO pilot is no longer involved in the project. ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' producers, Esther Dawson and Mike Chester will still produce the series and Kiedis will also co-produce the series along with Bram Sheldon.

He is best known as a founding member and the lead vocalist of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and has appeared on every album released by the band. Kiedis and his fellow band members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012.\n\nKiedis spent his youth in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] with his mother, then moved shortly before his twelfth birthday to live with his father in Hollywood. While attending [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]], Kiedis developed close friendships with fellow students [[Flea (musician)|Michael Balzary]] (later known as Flea) and [[Hillel Slovak]], who at the time were members of a band called [[Anthym]]. After high school, Kiedis began taking classes at [[UCLA]], but dropped out early in his sophomore year.\n\nHe later received an offer to be the opening act for a local band, and enlisted [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Hillel Slovak|Slovak]], and drummer [[Jack Irons]] to assist. After a show under the name ''\"Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem\"'', the band progressed and the line-up eventually became the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nHe has recorded eleven studio albums with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Kiedis' lyrical style has evolved throughout his career; early recordings discussed topics such as sex and life in Los Angeles, while more recent songs focus on more reflective themes including love, addiction, and loss. Additionally, his vocal style has shifted from [[rapping]] to more conventional singing. He struggled with addiction for the majority of his life up until the year 2000 and has since remained drug free.\n\n==Early life==\nKiedis was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Margaret \"Peggy\" (Noble) and actor John Michael Kiedis, known professionally as Blackie Dammett.<ref name=\"Kiedis, Anthony 2004 39\">Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 39</ref> His paternal grandfather's family emigrated from [[Lithuania]] in the early 1900s; the remainder of his ancestry includes Irish, English, French and Dutch.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, p. 9</ref> In 1966, when he was three years old, his parents divorced and he was then raised by his mother in Grand Rapids. His mother later remarried and had two more children, Anthony's half sisters.<ref name=\"Kiedis14\">Kiedis, Sloman, p. 14</ref> Each summer, he would visit his father in Hollywood for two weeks, a time during which the two would bond.

Irons and [[Hillel Slovak]] had begun playing together in high school while performing in a band called Chain Reaction. The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chilean-born vocalist and guitarist [[Alain Johannes]]. With Strasman set on becoming a lawyer, he quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college. At this point, Flea was brought into the mix. Shortly after hanging out with the band, and attending a few shows, Kiedis was offered a position in the band by Flea. He began as a \"hype man\", going out in front of the band blurting out jokes to the audience and getting them pumped up. \"<ref>Thompson, Dave. \"Footnote Archives: What Is This Pre-Chili Peppers Anthym?\" Proquest.

Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal \"literally asleep\".<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 191</ref> He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo [[drug rehabilitation]]. During that time, the band won the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey. He visited his mother in [[Michigan]] for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 193</ref> Kiedis checked into a [[Salvation Army]] rehabilitation clinic in [[Grand Rapids]], an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him.

The band hired guitarist [[Arik Marshall]] to complete the remaining tour dates. The band appeared live on the Grammy's ceremony with George Clinton's [[Parliament-Funkadelic|P-Funk]] collective and many others, performing a medley that included \"[[Give It Away (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Give It Away]]\".\n\n===1994\u20131997: ''One Hot Minute''===\nMonths went by, and only small amounts of material were written leading Chad Smith to publicly announce that Kiedis was suffering from writer's block (something Kiedis denied).

The tour to support the album was also met with mixed results. Chad Smith broke his arm prior to the launch of the U.S. tour in 1995 so it was delayed until early 1996. Near the tour's end, Kiedis was involved in a motorcycle accident which left him with a broken arm. The tour ended with the band's final set being cut short due to a massive typhoon. 1997 was dubbed by the band the year of nothing.\n\n===1998\u20132010: ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' and ''Stadium Arcadium''===\nThe band regrouped in 1998 to begin writing for their seventh studio album; however, Navarro was now battling his own drug problems.

Kiedis had a brief relationship in 1990 with singer [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] who inspired him to write \"I Could Have Lied\" on 1991's ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' while a brief fling with [[Spice Girls]] singer [[Melanie Chisholm|Melanie \"Sporty Spice\" Chisholm]] inspired \"Emit Remmus\" from 1999's ''Californication''. [[Yohanna Logan]], with whom Kiedis dated on and off from 1998\u20132003, served as a positive inspiration on songs from the ''Californication'' era such as the outtake \"Fat Dance\" while their breakup inspired 2002's ''By the Way'' album and many of its song lyrics.\n\nA failed two-year relationship with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, who was 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as a major influence on his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, ''The Getaway'' which often had Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. \"Lyrically, I'm embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship was a bit of a disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,\" Kiedis said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/melbourne-model-helena-vestergaard-declares-love-for-red-hot-chili-peppers-frontman-anthony-kiedis/story-e6frfmq9-1226733464104|title=Melbourne model Helena Vestergaard declares love for Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis|date=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/red-hot-chili-peppers-anthony-kiedis-relationship-disaster-inspired-new-album/|title=Anthony Kiedis: Relationship 'Disaster' Inspired New Album}}</ref>\n\nIn a June 2016 interview, Kiedis opened up about his past relationships saying that there were years when he had over 100 sexual partners and stated \"If I saw a pretty girl, I wanted to have her.\" When asked about marriage and growing old and alone Kiedis responded by saying \"Maybe it is because I never learned to live in a relationship and as silly as it sounds, I do not understand women yet.

A few years into the band's career, he was briefly fired due to his heavy drug use, and at times it got so bad that he failed to show up to some of the band's performances. One night, Kiedis decided to go out and score drugs, which made him miss a performance so the band replaced him with singer [[Keith Morris]].\n\nHe tried to get clean after Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] died of a heroin overdose while [[speedball (drug)|speedballing]] on June 25, 1988, saying he would never shoot up again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stadium-arcadium.com/main/biography-anthony-kiedis.php |title=Anthony Kiedis Biography |publisher=Stadium-Arcadium.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930025706/http://www.stadium-arcadium.com/main/biography-anthony-kiedis.php |archivedate=September 30, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He entered [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] and ended up staying clean for five years, but he relapsed in 1994, causing a major delay in the release of the band's 1995 album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', and he kept using on and off over the next six years.\n\nThe last major relapse was instigated by a doctor prescribing him [[Ultram]] despite Kiedis specifically asking for drugs that are not in the opiate family. To a recovering heroin addict, the synthetic opiate gives rise to strong cravings. He has reportedly avoided another relapse since December 24, 2000. \"It's easy to be a junkie, but it's not easy to be one of the best guitarists or songwriters of all time\", Kiedis said, referring to [[John Frusciante]], in the March 2007 issue of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first= Chris | last= Norris | title= ''Anthony Kiedis: The Pursuit of Happiness'' | date= March 2007 | work= Blender Magazine | url= http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2486&src=GM7070:MD | accessdate= February 13, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210204108/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2486&src=GM7070:MD | archive-date= December 10, 2007 | url-status= dead | df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Bandhistory\">{{cite book |url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=10318139705&searchurl=bsi%3D0%26ds%3D30%26isbn%3D0316726729 |last1=Kiedis |first1=Anthony |authorlink1=Anthony Kiedis |last2=Sloman |first2=Larry |title=Scar Tissue |publisher=[[Time Warner]] Books |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-316-72672-9 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref> In May 2012 after over twenty years of speculation ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'' stated that the location where Kiedis would purchase and use drugs which inspired \"[[Under the Bridge]]\" is located in [[MacArthur Park]] in Los Angeles, California, based on clues taken from Kiedis' memoir.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/report-bridge-from-chili-peppers-under-the-bridge-identified-in-l-a-20120525 |title=Report: Bridge from Chili Peppers' 'Under the Bridge' Identified in L.A. &#124; Music News |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> In 2014, LA Weekly strongly asserted that the conclusion of the Vulture Magazine piece is not correct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-red-hot-chili-peppers-bridge-is-not-where-you-think-it-is-an-investigation-5279185 |title=Report: The Red Hot Chili Peppers' Bridge Is Not Where You Think It Is: An Investigation |publisher=LA Weekly |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Feud with Mike Patton==\n{{fanpov|date=November 2019}}\nFor over 30 years, Kiedis and [[Faith No More]]/[[Mr. Bungle]] singer [[Mike Patton]] have been involved in an ongoing feud.

However, things turned ugly between the two in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement Patton of imitating his style on stage and in their music video for their biggest hit \"[[Epic (Faith No More song)|Epic]]\" (from 1989's follow up to ''Introduce Yourself'', ''[[The Real Thing (Faith No More album)|The Real Thing]])''. Kiedis stated \"I watched [their] \"Epic\" video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it looked like I was looking in a mirror. I love ''The Real Thing'', and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?'\".<ref name=\"MrBungleFAQ\"/> The feud between the two was reignited in 1999 when Mr. Bungle was scheduled to release their album ''[[California (Mr. Bungle album)|California]]'' on June 8, 1999 but [[Warner Bros.

Come summer, we get a call from the three biggest of those festivals, all of them the same day, saying that we can't play because the headlining band retains the right to hire and fire whomever they wish. We found out it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so our manager called their manager to find out what the hell was going on, and their manager was very apologetic, and said, 'We're really sorry, we want you to know this doesn't reflect the management's position, or the band's for that matter.

Patton introduced each Mr. Bungle band member with the name of one of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, before covering the songs \"[[Give It Away (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Give It Away]]\", \"[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]\", \"[[Under the Bridge]]\" and \"[[Scar Tissue]]\", with Patton deliberately using incorrect lyrics. Mr. Bungle also satirized many of the mannerisms of the band, mocking heroin injections, deceased guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], and on-stage antics. Kiedis responded by having them removed from the 2000 [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Kiedis said of the festival shows, \"I would not have given two fucks if they played there with us. But after I heard about [the] Halloween show where they mocked us, fuck him and fuck the whole band.\" Patton went on to claim that Kiedis' actions had \"ruined\" Mr. Bungle's career,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3FHXXP5T3U|title=Mike Patton (Fant\u00f4mas) on Anthony Kiedis|date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> while bassist [[Trevor Dunn]] remarked, \"It really screwed us up.

Patton said, \"It's not worth talking about. I've no idea what it was about then and I don't know now. But I bet we'd have a warm embrace if we saw each other now.\" In 2016, Trey Spruance reflected on the Mr. Bungle feud, stating that it was a \"weird and unprofessional jealous vendetta from a huge successful band towards an industry pip-squeak.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2016/11/trey-spruance-halloween-interview.html|title=TREY SPRUANCE HALLOWEEN INTERVIEW|website=faithnomorefollowers.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[Fox News]] host [[Greg Gutfeld]] injected himself into the Chili Peppers/Patton feud, taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and [[Koko the gorilla]]. Gutfeld said, \"As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More. Don't ever forget it.\" After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying, \"Two days ago, I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I received a lot of flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [are] the worst band in the universe. I'd like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain that we live in a binary universe,\" he continued. \"You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/08/fox-news-continues-its-vicious-assault-against-red-hot-chili-peppers/|title=Fox News continues its vicious assault against Red Hot Chili Peppers|date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying, \"I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us.

His first musical memory was hearing [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" at age eleven: \"It moved me so much that I insisted my mother buy me the 45.\"<ref name=\"Mullen116\">Mullen, 2010. p. 116</ref> In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]'s \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" and the \"in-your-face sexual lyrics\" of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s \"[[Dirty Mind (Prince song)|Dirty Mind]]\".<ref name=\"Mullen78\">Mullen, 2010. p. 78</ref> Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' album, [[John Frusciante]] and Flea have written nearly all of the music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, \"Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they're doing.\" His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of [[Charles Bukowski]], Kiedis' main literary influence.<ref name=\"Bandhistory\"/>\n\nHis early vocal style with the band primarily consisted of [[rapping]]. On ''Mother's Milk'' (1989), Kiedis wrote more melody-driven songs, rather than the basic rhythm and beat style of [[funk]]. The first song where Kiedis employed his new melodic style was \"[[Knock Me Down]]\". The melody was actually shaped and performed by guitarist John Frusciante. Upon joining the band, Frusciante sang lead vocals on the song along with Kiedis. ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' in 1991 still saw Kiedis rapping, but he also started singing in songs such as \"[[Under the Bridge]]\", \"[[Breaking the Girl]]\", and \"I Could Have Lied\". Over the years, Kiedis grew to favor singing over rapping. Kiedis has had many [[vocal coaches]], but none of them had helped him sing \"well.\" In fact, it was not until 1999's ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' that he felt he could take full control of his voice while singing.<ref name=\"Bandhistory\"/>\n\n===''Scar Tissue''===\nOn October 6, 2004, Kiedis published a memoir titled ''[[Scar Tissue (book)|Scar Tissue]]'', which he co-wrote with author [[Larry Sloman]]. The book was originally intended to be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography.<ref name=\"Memoir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1492057/anthony-kiedis-scary-past-revealed-book.jhtml|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=For Anthony Kiedis, What Doesn't Kill You Only Makes Your Book Longer|date=October 7, 2004|accessdate=December 7, 2011|publisher=MTV News}}</ref> He further explained: \"One would just kind of assume that with all the [drug] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy. But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents', or any of my friends'. My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, 'Wow, I don't ... were we there?'\"<ref name=\"Memoir\"/> The book was an international bestseller.<ref>Front cover of Scar Tissue</ref>\n\nIn a June 2016 interview, Kiedis stated that he at first regretted writing ''Scar Tissue'' saying \"I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused\u2014then, I started seeing the long term positive reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools, and it was having a positive effect. I realised that the whole point of writing that book wasn't for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.\" Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. \"I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.\" Kiedis said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/red-hot-chili-peppers/news/anthony-kiedis-i-regretted-memoir-but-it-had-a-positive-effect_5297245|title=Anthony Kiedis: &#039;I Regretted Memoir But It Had A Positive Effect&#039;|date=June 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Potential television series===\nKiedis was developing a series for [[HBO]] based on his unconventional upbringing in Los Angeles. The show was expected to be loosely based on much of Kiedis' autobiography. He had partnered with Catapult 360 partners Marc Abrams and [[Mike Benson (screenwriter)|Michael Benson]] to create the series, titled ''Spider and Son''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laudadio |first=Marisa |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20274341,00.html |title=Anthony Kiedis's Red-Hot Roommate?

On October 14, 2011 it was announced that HBO was no longer interested in the series and that [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] has picked up the rights to air the series. John Sayles, who wrote a script for the HBO pilot is no longer involved in the project. ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' producers, Esther Dawson and Mike Chester will still produce the series and Kiedis will also co-produce the series along with Bram Sheldon. It is unknown if the series will still follow the relationship between Kiedis and his father Blackie or if the entire autobiography will be the focus of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Anthony-Kiedis-Scar-Tissue-Moves-From-HBO-FX-36054.html|title = Anthony Kiedis' Scar Tissue Moves From HBO To FX|publisher = Cinemablend.com|date = October 14, 2011|accessdate = May 1, 2012}}</ref> In 2013, Dammett briefly mentioned the status of the series, which will be based on both Kiedis and Dammett's biographies, but stated that it was \"mothballed\" with hopes of resuming it once the Chili Peppers concluded their tour that year.<ref>{{cite web|author = Courtesy|url = http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/04/blackie_dammett_father_of_red.html|title = Blackie Dammett, father of Red Hot Chili Peppers' Anthony Kiedis, publishes autobiography|publisher = MLive.com|date = April 17, 2013|accessdate = June 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Red Hot Chili Peppers discography}}\n;Red Hot Chili Peppers\n*''[[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|The Red Hot Chili Peppers]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Freaky Styley]]'' (1985)\n*''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991)\n*''[[One Hot Minute]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999)\n*''[[By the Way]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006)\n*''[[I'm with You (album)|I'm with You]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Getaway (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|The Getaway]] ''(2016)\n\n==Filmography==\n*''[[F.I.S.T.]]'' (1978) as Kevin Kovak (billed as Cole Dammett)\n*''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' (1978, Episode: \"It's a Mile from Here to Glory\") as Jimmy Plummer (billed as Cole Dammett)\n*''Jokes My Folks Never Told Me'' (1978) as Student (billed as Cole Dammett)\n*''[[Thrashin' (film)|Thrashin']]'' (1986) as Himself (uncredited)\n*''[[Tough Guys]]'' (1986) as Red Hot Chili Peppers Member\n*''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987) as Musician #3\n*''[[Point Break]]'' (1991) as Tone\n*''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' (1994) as Will\n*''[[Song to Song]]'' (2017) as Himself\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n | last = Apter\n | first = Jeff\n | title = Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story\n | year = 2004\n | publisher = [[Omnibus Press]]\n | isbn = 1-84449-381-4\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Kiedis\n | first1 = Anthony\n | authorlink1 = Anthony Kiedis\n | last2 = Sloman\n | first2 = Larry\n | title = Scar Tissue\n | publisher = [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]]\n | date= October 6, 2004\n | isbn = 1-4013-0101-0 | title-link = Scar Tissue (book)\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Mullen\n | first = Brendan\n | title = An Oral/Visual History by the Red Hot Chili Peppers\n | publisher = It Books\n | date= October 19, 2010\n | location = Los Angeles\n | page = 256\n | isbn = 978-0-06-135191-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q204751|c=Category:Anthony Kiedis|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|wikt=no|s=no|species=no}}\n* {{IMDb name|0452347}}\n\n{{Red Hot Chili Peppers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kiedis, Anthony}}\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n[[Category:American alternative rock musicians]]\n[[Category:American autobiographers]]\n[[Category:American baritones]]\n[[Category:American expatriates in Germany]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male rappers]]\n[[Category:American people of Dutch descent]]\n[[Category:American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:American people of French descent]]\n[[Category:American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:American people of Lithuanian descent]]\n[[Category:American punk rock singers]]\n[[Category:American rock songwriters]]\n[[Category:Fairfax High School (Los Angeles) alumni]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Grand Rapids, Michigan]]\n[[Category:People from Hollywood, Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers members]]\n[[Category:Singers from Michigan]]\n[[Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni]]\n[[Category:American male non-fiction writers]]\n", "name_user": "83.254.199.160", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I\u2019m sorry but there is no proof that Anthony has actually played guitar)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis"}
