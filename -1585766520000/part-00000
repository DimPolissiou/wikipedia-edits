A [[North American University]] survey shows that the evolution of the disease in the country is slower than that observed elsewhere. Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59 thousand cases and 5.4 thousand deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths. Both, who had their health systems collapsed because of the disease, started the fight by restricting the tests to only the most serious cases \u2013 the same Brazilian strategy.

A [[North American University]] survey shows that the evolution of the disease in the country is slower than that observed elsewhere. Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59 thousand cases and 5.4 thousand deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths. Both, who had their health systems collapsed because of the disease, started the fight by restricting the tests to only the most serious cases \u2013 the same Brazilian strategy.

They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n1979 <ref>CGL1590XXXXXX</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n1979 <ref>CGL1590107240</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

While his armor may protect him against the surrounding demons, the skull on a stump is held in front of the horse and the fall of the sand held by death in the face of the knight. According to writer Dorothy Getlein, \"there is a sense of obsolescence about the knight accompanied by Death and the Devil.\"<ref>Getlein & Getlein, 72</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Holland Cotter]] noted that the composition followed soon after D\u00fcrer's beloved mother died a painful death.<ref>Holland Cotter, \"The Renaissance Followed Him North\", ''The New York Times'', March 22, 2013, [https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9C06E5DE163AF931A15750C0A9659D8B63.html]</ref>\n\nAustrian 19th-century art historian [[Moritz Thausing]] suggested that D\u00fcrer had created ''Knight, Death and the Devil'' as part of a four-work cycle, each designed to illustrate one of the [[four temperaments]]. According to Thausing, the work was intended to represent [[Four Temperaments#Sanguine|sanguinity]], hence the \"S\" engraved in the work.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo4sAAAAMAAJ Masters in art: a series of illustrated monographs, Volume 5]. Bates and Guild Co., 1904. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nIt is generally believed that the portrayal is a literal, though pointed, celebration of the knight's Christian faith, and also of the ideals of [[humanism]]. An alternative interpretation was presented in 1970 by writer Sten Karling, and later by [[Ursula Meyer]], who suggested that the work did not seek to glorify the knight, but instead depicts a \"robber knight\" (''raubritter'').  They point to the lack of Christian or religious symbolism in the work and to the fox's tail wrapped on top the knight's lance \u2013 in Greek legend<ref>According to [[Physiologus]] text; see N\u00fcrnberg, 74</ref> the fox's tail was a symbol of greed, cunning and treachery, as well as [[lust]] and [[whoring]].<ref name=\"Dublin\">N\u00fcrnberg, 74</ref> However, knights were commonly depicted in contemporary art with a fox tail tied to the tip of their lance. Moreover, the fox tail was a common form of protective [[amulet]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lLBlor8nIu0C&pg=PA10 The Landsknechts], Douglas Miller, 10\u201311</ref>  in this interpretation Death and the Devil are merely the knight's companions on his journey, not omens.<ref>Meyer, 27\u201341</ref>\n\nThe work is considered one among three of D\u00fcrer's \"Meisterstiche\" (''master prints''); along with [[Saint Jerome in His Study (D\u00fcrer)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514).<ref name=\"BM\" /> In particular, the horse is skillfully rendered in geometric shapes that call to mind [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and reflect the [[Renaissance]] interest in natural sciences and anatomy.<ref name=\"Dublin\" />\n\nMost [[print room]]s with a significant collection will have a copy, and there are many, often late and worn, impressions in private collections.\n\n==Influence==\n=\n===Other writers===\nIn 1968 the Argentinian publisher Galerna published a volume in their book series \"''Variations on a Theme''\", the theme of this volume being D\u00fcrer's engraving.<ref name=\"BW\">Manguel, Alberto.

In it, Denevi does not try to tell who the knight is or which specific war the knight is returning from, because \"all wars are fragments of a single war, all wars make up the nameless war, simply the war, the War, so that although the knight returns from traveling through a fragment of the war, it is as if he had journeyed through all wars and all the war\".<ref name=\"BW\" /> Denevi notes the presence of the dog, the Devil and death, writing that \"the dog has smelt on the knight\u2019s armor the stench of Death and Hell, because the dog already knows what the knight does not know, it knows that in the knight\u2019s groin a pustule has begun to distill the juices of the Plague, and that Death and the Devil are waiting for the knight at the foot of the hill to take him with them\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Bailey, Martin.

While his armor may protect him against the surrounding demons, the skull on a stump is held in front of the horse and the fall of the sand held by death in the face of the knight. According to writer Dorothy Getlein, \"there is a sense of obsolescence about the knight accompanied by Death and the Devil.\"<ref>Getlein & Getlein, 72</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Holland Cotter]] noted that the composition followed soon after D\u00fcrer's beloved mother died a painful death.<ref>Holland Cotter, \"The Renaissance Followed Him North\", ''The New York Times'', March 22, 2013, [https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9C06E5DE163AF931A15750C0A9659D8B63.html]</ref>\n\nAustrian 19th-century art historian [[Moritz Thausing]] suggested that D\u00fcrer had created ''Knight, Death and the Devil'' as part of a four-work cycle, each designed to illustrate one of the [[four temperaments]]. According to Thausing, the work was intended to represent [[Four Temperaments#Sanguine|sanguinity]], hence the \"S\" engraved in the work.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo4sAAAAMAAJ Masters in art: a series of illustrated monographs, Volume 5]. Bates and Guild Co., 1904. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nIt is generally believed that the portrayal is a literal, though pointed, celebration of the knight's Christian faith, and also of the ideals of [[humanism]]. An alternative interpretation was presented in 1970 by writer Sten Karling, and later by [[Ursula Meyer]], who suggested that the work did not seek to glorify the knight, but instead depicts a \"robber knight\" (''raubritter'').  They point to the lack of Christian or religious symbolism in the work and to the fox's tail wrapped on top the knight's lance \u2013 in Greek legend<ref>According to [[Physiologus]] text; see N\u00fcrnberg, 74</ref> the fox's tail was a symbol of greed, cunning and treachery, as well as [[lust]] and [[whoring]].<ref name=\"Dublin\">N\u00fcrnberg, 74</ref> However, knights were commonly depicted in contemporary art with a fox tail tied to the tip of their lance. Moreover, the fox tail was a common form of protective [[amulet]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lLBlor8nIu0C&pg=PA10 The Landsknechts], Douglas Miller, 10\u201311</ref>  in this interpretation Death and the Devil are merely the knight's companions on his journey, not omens.<ref>Meyer, 27\u201341</ref>\n\nThe work is considered one among three of D\u00fcrer's \"Meisterstiche\" (''master prints''); along with [[Saint Jerome in His Study (D\u00fcrer)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514).<ref name=\"BM\" /> In particular, the horse is skillfully rendered in geometric shapes that call to mind [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and reflect the [[Renaissance]] interest in natural sciences and anatomy.<ref name=\"Dublin\" />\n\nMost [[print room]]s with a significant collection will have a copy, and there are many, often late and worn, impressions in private collections.\n\n==Influence==\n===German struggle===\n[[File:Portrait of Martin Luther as an Augustinian Monk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Posthumous portrait of [[Martin Luther]] as an [[Order of St. Augustine|Augustinian]] friar]]\nIn 1870 [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] gave a print of the engraving to [[Richard Wagner]].

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n|first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n|last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n|num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

In 1993, the UWF released six volumes of [[PAL]] videos in Germany through Summit International Pictures under the \"Wrestling Super Champs\" banner. They were all compilations of Fury Hour matches.

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

[[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n|first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n|last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n|num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

In 1993, the UWF released six volumes of [[PAL]] videos in Germany through Summit International Pictures under the \"Wrestling Super Champs\" banner. They were all compilations of Fury Hour matches.

These studies showed that 4-methylamphetamine is much more potent at elevating serotonin (~18 x baseline) relative to dopamine (~5 x baseline). The authors speculated that this is because 5-HT release dampens DA release through some mechanism.

These studies showed that 4-methylamphetamine is much more potent at elevating serotonin (~18 x baseline) relative to dopamine (~5 x baseline). The authors speculated that this is because 5-HT release dampens DA release through some mechanism.
