To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953.

After returning to [[California Institute of Technology]] for a short while, Shockley moved to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]], in 1956, and founded [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]]. Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.  Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire.\"\n\nAccording to Arbuckle (p.&nbsp;380\u2013381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E. Allen and C. Burnham led the way to \"build a line from San Francisco to Marysville via San Jose, Stockton, and Sacramento\".  Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, \"\u2026San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.  The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24.\"\n\nThe Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology.

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs.

Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of [[venture capital]] on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3&nbsp;billion [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.<ref name=\"WRichardScott\" />\n\nIn 1971 [[Don Hoefler]] traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]]'s eight co-founders.<ref name=DH-71 /><ref name=\"NetValley\">[http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the \"Golden\" Startups of Silicon Valley] by Gregory Gromov</ref> The key investors in [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] were from the same group, directly leading to ''[[Tech Crunch]]'' 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 Trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.<ref name=Morris-2014>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/ |title=The First Trillion-Dollar Startup | work=[[Tech Crunch]] |first=Rhett |last=Morris |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref>\n{{Wide image|Silicon Vally Venture Capital investment.png|800px|align-cap=center|Silicon Valley [[venture capital]] investment, 2002-2017.|100%|center}}\n\n===Law firms===\nPrior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced [[patent attorney]]s whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property.  During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley.

Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.\n\nUsing money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].\n\nWhile Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.<ref>[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com</ref> Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over [[Stanford University]]'s [[Ethernet]] [[campus network]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John K. |last = Waters |date= 2002 |title= John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility  |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=  9780471273554| page = 28}}</ref>\n\n===Internet age===\n{{main|Internet}}\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.<ref name=N1995>{{cite book|author1=W.

The series, based on the characters of [[DC Comics]], airs on [[The CW]] and is a spin-off featuring characters introduced in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' along with new characters, set in the [[Arrowverse]], the same fictional universe. It is the fourth series in the Arrowverse, after ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', and [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'']]. The series premiered in January 2016. ''Legends of Tomorrow'' has been renewed for a [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|fifth season]], which premiered in January 2020. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n{{further|List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\nThe first main character introduced in the series is [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]], a member of the Time Masters, an organization tasked with protecting the timeline. Hunter goes rogue after [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]] murders his family early in the series. Intending to stop Savage, Hunter recruits a team consisting of characters previously introduced in other CW programs including [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer / Atom]], [[Sara Lance|Sara Lance / White Canary]], [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]] and [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson]] / Firestorm, [[Kendra Saunders (Arrowverse)|Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl]], [[Carter Hall (Arrowverse)|Carter Hall / Hawkman]], [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart / Captain Cold]], and [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory / Heat Wave]]. Season one's primary storyline involves the team discovering that the Time Masters were backing Savage. The team destroys that organization, though they lose Snart and Rip in the process.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]], with the Time Masters defeated, the team guard the timeline themselves, all while coping with Rip's disappearance. However, this season introduces the [[Legion of Doom]], a time-travelling team led by [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne)]]. He's shown to have recruited versions of [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]], [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], and Leonard Snart to find the Biblical [[Spear of Destiny]], with which they can alter their fates. Season two also shows the team joined by [[Justice Society of America]] member\n[[Amaya Jiwe|Amaya Jiwe / Vixen]] and modern-day historian [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood / Steel]], who later acquires the power to become solid metal.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|season three]], the team discovers that they created [[anachronism]]s throughout time after beating the Legion, though Rip has formed the Time Bureau to help fix them. He also tells them that [[Nora Darhk]] has resurrected her father, Damien, as well as recruited Amaya's villainous granddaughter, [[Kuasa]], and enemy of the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]] [[Gorilla Grodd]] so that they can release the demon Mallus. Though the team loses Firestorm, they're joined by [[Zari Tomaz]], a hacktivist from 2042 who wields an air-controlling amulet, and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West / Kid Flash]], a speedster who trained under the Flash. Time Bureau agent and later director [[Ava Sharpe]] also starts working closely with the team in this season, entering a relationship with Sara Lance. Upon defeating Mallus, Amaya returns home to Zambesi and Wally departs to find his own way.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|season four]], [[occult detective fiction|occult detective]] [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] joins the team to help them hunt down magical fugitives that have been scattered throughout the timeline following the team's battle with Mallus. Along the way, they eventually discover that events surrounding the creatures have been orchestrated by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], who Constantine has faced before. The Legends are joined further by the shapeshifter [[Charlie (Arrowverse)|Charlie]], who becomes stuck in Amaya's physical form after losing her powers, and [[Mona Wu]], who has the ability to turn into a [[Kaupe]].\n{{:List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|List of Arrowverse cast members}}\n\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein / Firestorm]] (seasons 1\u20133): <br />A nuclear physicist focused on transmutation and also half of the superhero Firestorm with Jefferson Jackson.

The only set that was built was the Waverider. That being said, because we knew there was a pickup for the show, it wasn't a conventional pilot. All the resources of construction went into the Waverider. That's continuing into the series. I don't think they tend to build much. I think they tend to adapt locations because there's so much time travel and so many eras to create.<ref name=\"Winter\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Broadcast==\n''Legends of Tomorrow'' premiered in the United States on January 21, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cw-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-premiere-date-1201647117/ |title=CW Slots 'DC's Legends of Tomorrow' for Thursdays; 'Vampire Diaries' to Friday |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=Kissel |first=Rick |date=November 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124135435/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cw-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-premiere-date-1201647117/ |archivedate=November 24, 2015 }}</ref> and the first season consisted of sixteen episodes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow/listings/|title=Shows A-Z \u2013 dc's legends of tomorrow on the cw|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref> The series premiere in Australia was originally announced as January 20, 2016,<ref name=FoxtelUpfronts>{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |first=David |last=Knox |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/foxtel-upfronts-2016-local-thrillers-lifestyle-us-drama.html |title=Foxtel Upfronts 2016: Local thrillers, Lifestyle & US Drama. |date=November 5, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107212555/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/foxtel-upfronts-2016-local-thrillers-lifestyle-us-drama.html |archivedate=November 7, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |first=David |last=Knox |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/airdate-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow.html |title=Airdate: DC's Legends of Tomorrow |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116141125/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/airdate-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow.html |archivedate=November 16, 2015 }}</ref> however it was pushed back until January 22.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-In-January-200-shows-including-DC-s-Legends-Of-Tomorrow/ba-p/106619 |title=New In January: 200+ shows including DC's Legends Of Tomorrow, Andrew Winter's Tiny House & more |publisher=The Green Room |first=Chuck |last=Purcell |date=December 24, 2015 |accessdate=January 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103045859/http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-In-January-200-shows-including-DC-s-Legends-Of-Tomorrow/ba-p/106619 |archivedate=January 3, 2016 }}</ref> It started airing in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sky-takes-legends-tomorrow-uk-843856 |title=DC's 'Legends of Tomorrow' Docks With Sky in U.K. |last=Ritman |first=Alex |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 25, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126134506/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sky-takes-legends-tomorrow-uk-843856 |archivedate=November 26, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n!

The series, based on the characters of [[DC Comics]], airs on [[The CW]] and is a spin-off featuring characters introduced in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' along with new characters, set in the [[Arrowverse]], the same fictional universe. It is the fourth series in the Arrowverse, after ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', and [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'']]. The series premiered in January 2016. ''Legends of Tomorrow'' has been renewed for a [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|fifth season]], which premiered in January 2020. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n{{further|List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\nThe first main character introduced in the series is [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]], a member of the Time Masters, an organization tasked with protecting the timeline. Hunter goes rogue after [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]] murders his family early in the series. Intending to stop Savage, Hunter recruits a team consisting of characters previously introduced in other CW programs including [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer / Atom]], [[Sara Lance|Sara Lance / White Canary]], [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]] and [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson]] / Firestorm, [[Kendra Saunders (Arrowverse)|Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl]], [[Carter Hall (Arrowverse)|Carter Hall / Hawkman]], [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart / Captain Cold]], and [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory / Heat Wave]]. Season one's primary storyline involves the team discovering that the Time Masters were backing Savage. The team destroys that organization, though they lose Snart and Rip in the process.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]], with the Time Masters defeated, the team guard the timeline themselves, all while coping with Rip's disappearance. However, this season introduces the [[Legion of Doom]], a time-travelling team led by [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne)]]. He's shown to have recruited versions of [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]], [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], and Leonard Snart to find the Biblical [[Spear of Destiny]], with which they can alter their fates. Season two also shows the team joined by [[Justice Society of America]] member\n[[Amaya Jiwe|Amaya Jiwe / Vixen]] and modern-day historian [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood / Steel]], who later acquires the power to become solid metal.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|season three]], the team discovers that they created [[anachronism]]s throughout time after beating the Legion, though Rip has formed the Time Bureau to help fix them. He also tells them that [[Nora Darhk]] has resurrected her father, Damien, as well as recruited Amaya's villainous granddaughter, [[Kuasa]], and enemy of the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]] [[Gorilla Grodd]] so that they can release the demon Mallus. Though the team loses Firestorm, they're joined by [[Zari Tomaz]], a hacktivist from 2042 who wields an air-controlling amulet, and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West / Kid Flash]], a speedster who trained under the Flash. Time Bureau agent and later director [[Ava Sharpe]] also starts working closely with the team in this season, entering a relationship with Sara Lance. Upon defeating Mallus, Amaya returns home to Zambesi and Wally departs to find his own way.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|season four]], [[occult detective fiction|occult detective]] [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] joins the team to help them hunt down magical fugitives that have been scattered throughout the timeline following the team's battle with Mallus. Along the way, they eventually discover that events surrounding the creatures have been orchestrated by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], who Constantine has faced before. The Legends are joined further by the shapeshifter [[Charlie (Arrowverse)|Charlie]], who becomes stuck in Amaya's physical form after losing her powers, and [[Mona Wu]], who has the ability to turn into a [[Kaupe]].\n{{:List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|List of Arrowverse cast members}}\n\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein / Firestorm]] (seasons 1\u20133): <br />A nuclear physicist focused on transmutation and also half of the superhero Firestorm with Jefferson Jackson.

Once you save the world, what do you do then?... The fact that the world was in peril sort of forced our team to fall into its own dysfunctional version of lockstep. Season two, they're no longer going to be hunted by Time Masters. They're no longer going to be burdened with having to save the world. It's no longer going to be about saving Miranda and Jonas.

Because you don't necessarily know if you are going to have a show that's been picked up, they don't want to invest a lot of money in the infrastructure, so you end up shooting more on location. The only set that was built was the Waverider. That being said, because we knew there was a pickup for the show, it wasn't a conventional pilot. All the resources of construction went into the Waverider. That's continuing into the series. I don't think they tend to build much.

It is possible for kernel code to indicate such a condition by calling the <code>panic</code> function located in the header file {{samp|sys/system.h}}. However, most panics are the result of unhandled processor [[Exception handling|exceptions]] in kernel code, such as references to invalid memory addresses. These are typically indicative of a [[Computer bug|bug]] somewhere in the call chain leading to the panic. They can also indicate a failure of hardware, such as a failed RAM cell or errors in arithmetic functions in the processor caused by a [[Pentium FDIV bug|processor bug]], overheating/damaged processor, or a [[soft error]].\n\nA report of a non-fatal bug in the kernel is called an \"[[Linux kernel oops|oops]]\"; such deviations from correct behavior of the Linux kernel may allow continued operation with compromised reliability.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0303.1/0009.html |title=Re: what's an OOPS |last=Bradford |first=John |date=8 March 2003 |mailinglist=[[LKML]] |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> These crash reports are automatically collected and can be sent upstream by various software, such as kerneloops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://linux.die.net/man/8/kerneloops |title=kerneloops(8) - Linux man page |publisher=Linux.die.net |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> ABRT ([[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/ABRTF12 |title=Features/ABRTF12 |date=3 August 2009 |publisher=FedoraProject |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> and apport ([[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]).

To debug such conditions, other methods such as attaching a serial port console can be used.\n\n==== Live patching ====\nRebootless updates can even be applied to the kernel by using [[live patching]] technologies such as [[Ksplice]], [[kpatch]] and [[kGraft]]. Minimalistic foundations for live kernel patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on 12 April 2015. Those foundations, known as ''livepatch'' and based primarily on the kernel's [[ftrace]] functionality, form a common core capable of supporting hot patching by both kGraft and kpatch, by providing an [[application programming interface]] (API) for kernel modules that contain hot patches and an [[application binary interface]] (ABI) for the userspace management utilities. However, the common core included into Linux kernel&nbsp;4.0 supports only the [[x86]] architecture and does not provide any mechanisms for ensuring [[Function (programming)|function]]-level consistency while the hot patches are applied. {{As of|2015|04}}, there is ongoing work on porting kpatch and kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.0#head-9aa7c8499b42911a48c02b24f367bf2bc6db8606\n| title = Linux kernel 4.0, Section 1.2.

Depending on how significant the change is and how many subsystems it modifies, the change will either be submitted as a single patch or in multiple patches of [[source code]]. In case of a single subsystem that is maintained by a single maintainer, these patches are sent as e-mails to the maintainer of the subsystem with the appropriate mailing list in Cc. The maintainer and the readers of the mailing list will review the patches and provide feedback. Once the review process has finished the subsystem maintainer accepts the patches in the relevant [[Git]] kernel tree. If the changes to the Linux kernel are bug fixes that are considered important enough, a pull request for the patches will be sent to Torvalds within a few days. Otherwise, a pull request will be sent to Torvalds during the next merge window. The merge window usually lasts two weeks and starts immediately after the release of the previous kernel version.<ref>{{cite web |title=How the development process works |url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/2.Process.html |accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> The Git kernel source tree names all developers who have contributed to the Linux kernel in the ''Credits'' directory and all subsystem maintainers are listed in ''Maintainers''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Linux Kernel Development: Linux Kernel Development |author= Robert Love|year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=9780768696790 |page=13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Development model ===\nThe Linux kernel project integrates new code on a rolling basis. Software checked into the project must work and [[compiling|compile]] without error. For each kernel subsystem there is a maintainer who is responsible for reviewing patches against the kernel code standards and keeps a queue of patches that can be submitted to Linus Torvalds within a merge window of several weeks. Patches are merged by Torvalds into the source code of the prior stable Linux kernel release, creating the ''-rc'' release candidate for the next stable kernel. Once the merge window is closed only fixes to the new code in the development release are accepted. The ''-rc'' development release of the kernel goes through [[regression tests]] and once it is judged to be stable by Torvalds and the kernel subsystem maintainers a new Linux kernel is released and the development process starts all over again.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pro Linux Embedded Systems |author= Gene Sally|year=2010 |publisher=Apress |isbn=9781430272267 |page=252 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopers who feel treated unfairly can report this to the [[Linux Foundation]]'s Technical Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web |title=Code of Conflict |url=https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/code-of-conflict.rst |accessdate=4 February 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In July 2013 the maintainer of the USB 3.0 driver [[Sarah Sharp]] asked Torvalds to address the abusive commentary in the kernel development community.

Therefore, the Linux kernel maintainers have designated some stable kernel releases as ''longterm'', these [[long-term support]] Linux kernels are updated with bug fixes for two or more years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Linux: Embedded Development |author= Alexandru Vaduva, Alex Gonzalez & Chris Simmonds|year=2016 |publisher=Packt Publishing|isbn=9781787124455 |page=663 }}</ref> In November 2019 there were five longterm Linux kernels:  4.19.84, 4.14.154, 4.9.201, 4.4.201 and 3.16.76.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/ |title=The Linux Kernel Archives |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref>  The full list of releases is at [[Linux kernel version history]].\n\n=== Relation with Linux distributions ===\nMost Linux users run a kernel supplied by their [[Linux distribution]]. Some distributions ship the \"vanilla\" or \"stable\" kernels. However, several Linux distribution vendors (such as [[Red Hat]] and [[Debian]]) maintain another set of Linux kernel branches which are integrated into their products. These are usually updated at a slower pace compared to the \"vanilla\" branch, and they usually include all fixes from the relevant \"stable\" branch, but at the same time they can also add support for drivers or features which had not been released in the \"vanilla\" version the distribution vendor started basing their branch from.\n\n=== Source code management ===\nThe Linux kernel development community uses [[Git]] to manage the kernel [[source code]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] initially developed this [[version control system]] with speed in mind and as a distributed system. Git users can obtain the latest pushed version of Torvalds' tree and keep up to date with the official kernel tree using the git pull.<ref>{{cite book |title=Linux Kernel Development: Linux Kernel Development |author= Robert Love|year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=9780768696790 |page=11 }}</ref> The kernel source code is distributed in [[GNU zip]] (gzip) and [[bzip2]] format.

In April 2005, efforts to [[reverse-engineer]] the BitKeeper system by [[Andrew Tridgell]] led BitMover, the company which maintained BitKeeper, to stop supporting the Linux development community. In response, Torvalds and others wrote a new source code control system for the purpose, called [[Git (software)|Git]].

It is possible for kernel code to indicate such a condition by calling the <code>panic</code> function located in the header file {{samp|sys/system.h}}. However, most panics are the result of unhandled processor [[Exception handling|exceptions]] in kernel code, such as references to invalid memory addresses. These are typically indicative of a [[Computer bug|bug]] somewhere in the call chain leading to the panic. They can also indicate a failure of hardware, such as a failed RAM cell or errors in arithmetic functions in the processor caused by a [[Pentium FDIV bug|processor bug]], overheating/damaged processor, or a [[soft error]].\n\nA report of a non-fatal bug in the kernel is called an \"[[Linux kernel oops|oops]]\"; such deviations from correct behavior of the Linux kernel may allow continued operation with compromised reliability.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0303.1/0009.html |title=Re: what's an OOPS |last=Bradford |first=John |date=8 March 2003 |mailinglist=[[LKML]] |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> These crash reports are automatically collected and can be sent upstream by various software, such as kerneloops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://linux.die.net/man/8/kerneloops |title=kerneloops(8) - Linux man page |publisher=Linux.die.net |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> ABRT ([[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/ABRTF12 |title=Features/ABRTF12 |date=3 August 2009 |publisher=FedoraProject |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> and apport ([[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]).

To debug such conditions, other methods such as attaching a serial port console can be used.\n\n==== Live patching ====\nRebootless updates can even be applied to the kernel by using [[live patching]] technologies such as [[Ksplice]], [[kpatch]] and [[kGraft]]. Minimalistic foundations for live kernel patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on 12 April 2015. Those foundations, known as ''livepatch'' and based primarily on the kernel's [[ftrace]] functionality, form a common core capable of supporting hot patching by both kGraft and kpatch, by providing an [[application programming interface]] (API) for kernel modules that contain hot patches and an [[application binary interface]] (ABI) for the userspace management utilities. However, the common core included into Linux kernel&nbsp;4.0 supports only the [[x86]] architecture and does not provide any mechanisms for ensuring [[Function (programming)|function]]-level consistency while the hot patches are applied. {{As of|2015|04}}, there is ongoing work on porting kpatch and kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.0#head-9aa7c8499b42911a48c02b24f367bf2bc6db8606\n| title = Linux kernel 4.0, Section 1.2.

Depending on how significant the change is and how many subsystems it modifies, the change will either be submitted as a single patch or in multiple patches of [[source code]]. In case of a single subsystem that is maintained by a single maintainer, these patches are sent as e-mails to the maintainer of the subsystem with the appropriate mailing list in Cc. The maintainer and the readers of the mailing list will review the patches and provide feedback. Once the review process has finished the subsystem maintainer accepts the patches in the relevant [[Git]] kernel tree. If the changes to the Linux kernel are bug fixes that are considered important enough, a pull request for the patches will be sent to Torvalds within a few days. Otherwise, a pull request will be sent to Torvalds during the next merge window. The merge window usually lasts two weeks and starts immediately after the release of the previous kernel version.<ref>{{cite web |title=How the development process works |url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/2.Process.html |accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> The Git kernel source tree names all developers who have contributed to the Linux kernel in the ''Credits'' directory and all subsystem maintainers are listed in ''Maintainers''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Linux Kernel Development: Linux Kernel Development |author= Robert Love|year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=9780768696790 |page=13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Development model ===\nThe Linux kernel project integrates new code on a rolling basis. Software checked into the project must work and [[compiling|compile]] without error. For each kernel subsystem there is a maintainer who is responsible for reviewing patches against the kernel code standards and keeps a queue of patches that can be submitted to Linus Torvalds within a merge window of several weeks. Patches are merged by Torvalds into the source code of the prior stable Linux kernel release, creating the ''-rc'' release candidate for the next stable kernel. Once the merge window is closed only fixes to the new code in the development release are accepted. The ''-rc'' development release of the kernel goes through [[regression tests]] and once it is judged to be stable by Torvalds and the kernel subsystem maintainers a new Linux kernel is released and the development process starts all over again.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pro Linux Embedded Systems |author= Gene Sally|year=2010 |publisher=Apress |isbn=9781430272267 |page=252 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopers who feel treated unfairly can report this to the [[Linux Foundation]]'s Technical Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web |title=Code of Conflict |url=https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/code-of-conflict.rst |accessdate=4 February 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In July 2013 the maintainer of the USB 3.0 driver [[Sarah Sharp]] asked Torvalds to address the abusive commentary in the kernel development community.

The issues brought up were a few days later discussed at the Maintainers Summit. Concerns over the lack of consistency in how maintainers responded to patches submitted by developers were echoed by [[Shuah Khan]], the maintainer of the kernel self-test framework. Torvalds contended that there would never be consistency in the handling of patches because different kernel subsystems have over time adopted different development processes.

Some distributions ship the \"vanilla\" or \"stable\" kernels. However, several Linux distribution vendors (such as [[Red Hat]] and [[Debian]]) maintain another set of Linux kernel branches which are integrated into their products. These are usually updated at a slower pace compared to the \"vanilla\" branch, and they usually include all fixes from the relevant \"stable\" branch, but at the same time they can also add support for drivers or features which had not been released in the \"vanilla\" version the distribution vendor started basing their branch from.\n\n=== Source code management ===\nThe Linux kernel development community uses [[Git]] to manage the kernel [[source code]].
