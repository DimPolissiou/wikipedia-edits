The episode was written by [[Andrew Kreisberg]] and [[Geoff Johns]] from a story by [[Greg Berlanti]] and Kreisberg and directed by [[David Nutter]]. It was first broadcast on October 14, 2014 in The CW. The show is itself an spin-off of the show ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', where many characters in the series were introduced during the second season. The episode revolves about Barry Allen ([[Grant Gustin]]), a CSI forensic scientist working for the Central City Police Department. During a visit to an event, the event is robbed by masked men. This is later revealed as the result of an accident during the accelerator explosion and the men are in fact a man who can duplicate himself. The episode also shows flashbacks when Barry tries to see his dad in jail, to Joe's disapproval.\n\nThe episode received positive reviews, with critics stating that the series' mysteries and intrigue are helping it for the future.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=May 2019}}\nWith Cisco's help, Barry saves people from a burning building before the firefighters arrive. Caitlin chastises them for doing other people's job and reminds them that they need to focus on catching the humans affected by the accelerator explosion while Wells and Cisco note that his rate has increased.\n\nBarry is called by Joe to investigate a crime scene of a murder in a shop. While surveillance shows a man shooting the person, Barry notes that six people with somehow the same shoe size were responsible for the marks in the floor. Iris then reminds him of an event they were going to attend by [[Simon Stagg]] for a school assignment. The event is then assaulted by robbers, who steal jewelry. Barry tries to stop them but he faints before he can catch them.\n\nIn S.T.A.R. Labs, the team deduce that Barry is getting [[Hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] from the use of his abilities due to a sped-up metabolism and needs to ingest more calories to maintain his energy level. Joe has found that Barry is investigating Henry's arrest and Nora's murder and chastises him. This causes to remember when a young Barry ran away from their home to meet with his dad in jail, who is later shown to have asked Joe to keep his son from visiting him in prison. Barry in response admits that he grew up without his father although he knew he was innocent all the time and states that Joe is not his dad, hurting him.\n\nStagg is attacked in his headquarters by the same robbers and Barry tries to defeat them but sees that they are duplicates of the man and escapes. The team deduce that the man is [[Multiplex (comics)|Danton Black]], an ex-employer for Stagg who was fired after Stagg took credit for his work and may have been testing the duplicate test during the accelerator explosion. During a talk with Iris, Barry sees that she seems to know there is someone dubbed the \"red streak\" who is saving people at a high speed.\n\nUsing an in vitro process from a cell, Caitlin manages to make a clone of Black. As the clone cannot move, the team deduce that Black is the original and the clones will stop when he is defeated. The clone begins to move and Joe shoots him, and they realize that the original Black is duplicating and heading to kill Stagg. Stagg's guards are killed by the clones. Barry tries to find Black but he makes hundreds of clones to disguise himself. Barry finds the original but when Black tries to kill him, he falls out a window. Barry holds him but Black refuses to be saved and falls to his death.\n\nBarry and Joe fix their problems, with Joe promising they will find out who killed his mother and free his father. Wells later visits Stagg and discuss Black, but Stagg states that his focus now is the Flash and plans to exploit his powers. Wells stands up and stabs Stagg to death, stating he needs to keep \"the fastest man alive\" safe.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Viewers===\nThe episode was watched by 4.27 million viewers with a 1.7 rating in the 18-49 demographics.<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/15/tuesday-final-ratings-the-flash-marvels-agents-of-s-h-i-e-ld-the-voice-about-a-boy-chicago-fire-adjusted-down/315328/ |title=Tuesday Final Ratings: 'The Flash', 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.LD.', 'The Voice' & 'The Mindy Project' Adjusted Up; 'About A Boy' & 'Chicago Fire' Adjusted Down |last=Bibel |first=Sara |work=TV by the Numbers |date=October 15, 2014 |access-date=August 11, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6TMI1HFqN?url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/15/tuesday-final-ratings-the-flash-marvels-agents-of-s-h-i-e-ld-the-voice-about-a-boy-chicago-fire-adjusted-down/315328/ |archive-date=October 16, 2014 |df= }}</ref> This was a 12% decrease in viewership from the pilot, which was watched by 4.83 million viewers with a 1.9 rating in the 18-49 demographics.<ref name=\"S1PremiereRatings\">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/10/08/the-flash-premiere-ratings/|title=Ratings: The Flash Hits the Ground Running, CW's Best Debut in 5 Years; ABC Sitcoms Tumble, POI Slips|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|publisher=[[TVLine]]|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref> ''The Flash'' ranked as the most watched program on The CW in the day, beating ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and also the most watched in the week, beating ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.

It is formed from professional military servicemen and non-military personnel. Units are located at [[\u0160iauliai military airfield]] near the city [[\u0160iauliai]], at [[Radvili\u0161kis]] and [[Kaunas]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1919\u20131940 ===\nAfter the declaration of [[Lithuania]] to be an independent state on February 16, 1918, the most urgent task of the new government was to organize a military force that could repel enemy armies that were coming from all sides. The first order for the creation of a Lithuanian army came on November 23, 1918.\n\nIn January 1919, an Engineering Company was formed within the military, which contained an Aviation Squad.<ref>A.Gamziukas, G.Ramo\u0161ka, Lithuanian Air Force 1919-1940, pg.&nbsp;262  [Lietuvos Karin\u0117 Aviacija 1919-1940, Lietuvos aviacijos muziejus, Kaunas, 1999, {{ISBN|9986-557-12-7}}]</ref> On March 12, 1919, the group was reorganized into an Aviation Company and became an independent military unit. Its leader was appointed to be marine engineer officer Petras Petronis. This date is considered to be the birthday of the Lithuanian Air Force.\n\nBetween March and December 1919 and between 1932 and 1940, the Kaunas Military Aviation School operated in that city. The school trained officers in many aviation disciplines: pilots, observers, gunners and mechanics.\n\nThe first aircraft ([[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter]]) was taken by the Lithuanian military from the Red Army, on February 5, 1919, at the city of [[Jieznas]].  On February 27, 1919, eight new reconnaissance aircraft, [[LVG C.VI]], were received. They had been purchased in Germany. In June, five more aircraft were purchased. In the following years some aircraft were taken as war booty and repaired in Lithuanian Aviation  workshops, many were purchased from various countries and a number were built by native designers [[Jurgis Dobkevi\u010dius]] and [[Antanas Gustaitis]].\n\nThe Lithuanian Military Aviation was active in battles with the Red Army and Polish military units. The pilot performing the most military sorties was Jurgis Dobkevi\u010dius, who later became the first Lithuanian aircraft designer and builder. On May 12, 1920, Vytautas Rauba was the first Lithuanian aviator to lose his life in an aircraft crash. On October 4 of the same year, in a fight with the Polish military, the first aircraft with a Lithuanian crew was shot down. The pilot of the aircraft, Juozas Kumpis, leader of Lithuania's First Air Squadron, was severely injured and died as prisoner of the Polish military.\n\nStarting in 1920 the military aviation branch was renamed a number of times and some time after 1928 it was named to the equivalent of the Lithuanian Air Force.\n\nThe Lithuanian Air Force supported and encouraged various aeronautics related activities, such as the sport of [[gliding]]. In 1933, in cooperation with [[Aero Club of Lithuania]], they helped establish a Lithuanian [[Gliding School in Nida]] and send their only experienced glider pilot, [[Gregorius Radvenis]], to be the school's instructor and supervisor.\n\nIn 1940, the Lithuanian Air Force consisted of eight Air Squadrons, including reconnaissance, fighter, bomber and training units. Air Force bases had been established in the cities and towns of [[Kaunas]] /\u017dagari\u0161k\u0117s, [[\u0160iauliai]] /Zokniai ([[Zokniai airfield]]), [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]] /[[Pajuostis]]. In the summer time, airports in the cities of [[Palanga]] and [[Rukla]] were also used. A total of 117 aircraft and 230 pilots and observers were listed in the books at that time.\n\n=== After 1992 ===\n[[File:Kauno tvirtove 2007-08-10.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of Lithuanian Air Force, Kaunas]]\nOn 23 January 1992, the [[Minister of Defense]] signed an order establishing the staff for the Aviation Base of the Aviation Service. But an actual base in the [[\u0160iauliai airport]] territory ([[Barysiai airfield]]) was not established until March, when according to the ordinance of the Government of Lithuanian Republic, all the infrastructure, buildings, territory and 24 [[An-2]] aircraft were passed from \u201d[[Lithuanian Airlines]]\" to the Aviation Service of the Ministry of Defense in January 1992.<br />On 12 June 1992, the first time after regaining the independence of Lithuania, An-2 aircraft, marked with the double cross of [[Vytis]] on its wings \u2013 the distinguishing sign of Lithuanian Air Force \u2013 took off from Barysiai airfield. This date is considered to be the Aviation Base foundation date. In February 1993 four L-39C Albatros aircraft were brought from Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAfter 1 March 1993 Aviation Service was reformed to the Lithuanian Air Force and Aviation Base was renamed the First Aviation Base of the Lithuanian Air Force. In January 1994 Lithuania officially applied for NATO membership. From 1995 to 1999, according to a decree of Lithuanian Government the First Aviation Base was relocated to [[Zokniai airfield]] nearby [[\u0160iauliai]], which was used for fighter wing, radio-electronic fight and reconnaissance squadrons dislocation during the [[Soviet occupation]].\n\nAccording to the decree of the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Lithuania [[Linas Linkevi\u010dius]], the First Aviation Base and the Second Aviation Base were reorganized into the Lithuanian Air Force Aviation Base as of 1 October 2004. Up to 2004, there were only light attack jet aircraft and transport aircraft located at the Air Base, after the reconstruction of First and Second Air Bases, helicopters are located at the Air Base too.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{Location map+ | Lithuania | relief = 1 | float=right | width=360| places=\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[\u0160iauliai International Airport|\u0160iauliai]]</small>|lat= 55.893889 |long= 23.394722 |position=left|mark=Green pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Karm\u0117lava]]</small>|lat= 54.972222 |long= 24.066667 |position=right|mark=Lightgreen pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Prienai|Antaver\u0161is]]</small>|lat= 54.633333 |long= 23.941667 |position=right|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[\u0160ilut\u0117|Degu\u010diai]]</small>|lat= 55.35 |long= 21.483333 |position=right|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Ignalina|Ceiki\u0161k\u0117s]]</small>|lat= 55.35 |long= 26.166667 |position=right|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Radvili\u0161kis]]</small>|lat= 55.8 |long= 23.55 |position=right|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n|caption=Lithuanian Air Force locations 2018: <br/> [[File:Green pog.svg|10px]] Air Base [[File:Blue pog.svg|10px]] Air Defence Battalion <br/> [[File:Lightgreen pog.svg|10px]] Air Space Control Centre [[File:Orange pog.svg|10px]] [[AN/TPS-77|AN/TPS-77(V)]] Radar Station}}\n\nThe Lithuanian Air Force Headquarters and the [[Airspace Surveillance and Control Command (Lithuania)|Airspace Surveillance and Control Command]] are located in [[Kaunas]], while the Air Space Control Centre and the [[Baltic Air Surveillance Network]]'s Regional Airspace Surveillance Coordination Centre (RASCC) are located nearby in [[Karm\u0117lava]].

NATO members provide usually 4 [[fighter aircraft]], based in Lithuania, to police the [[Baltic States]]\u2019 airspace. The deployments rotate between NATO members (that started in March 2004 with [[Belgium Air Force]] [[F-16]]s) and most NATO members that operate fighters have made a deployment to Lithuania. The Baltic States are considering in the near future to protect their airspace on their own.\n\n== Modernisation ==\nIn line with the set priorities, the Lithuanian Air Force are implementing modernisation plans.\nSince Independence in 1991, the Lithuanian Air force has bought 3 new [[C-27J Spartan]] [[military transport aircraft]]. They have replaced the older [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era [[An-26]].<br />\nIn 2007, two [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39ZA]] aircraft underwent extension of technical resources in [[Romania]]. Maintenance works included exhaustive check-up of the aircraft units and major engine repairs. New navigation equipment GNS 530 was installed and radio communication sets changed in pilot cabins.

It is formed from professional military servicemen and non-military personnel. Units are located at [[\u0160iauliai military airfield]] near the city [[\u0160iauliai]], at [[Radvili\u0161kis]] and [[Kaunas]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1919\u20131940 ===\nAfter the declaration of [[Lithuania]] to be an independent state on February 16, 1918, the most urgent task of the new government was to organize a military force that could repel enemy armies that were coming from all sides. The first order for the creation of a Lithuanian army came on November 23, 1918.\n\nIn January 1919, an Engineering Company was formed within the military, which contained an Aviation Squad.<ref>A.Gamziukas, G.Ramo\u0161ka, Lithuanian Air Force 1919-1940, pg.&nbsp;262  [Lietuvos Karin\u0117 Aviacija 1919-1940, Lietuvos aviacijos muziejus, Kaunas, 1999, {{ISBN|9986-557-12-7}}]</ref> On March 12, 1919, the group was reorganized into an Aviation Company and became an independent military unit. Its leader was appointed to be marine engineer officer Petras Petronis. This date is considered to be the birthday of the Lithuanian Air Force.\n\nBetween March and December 1919 and between 1932 and 1940, the Kaunas Military Aviation School operated in that city. The school trained officers in many aviation disciplines: pilots, observers, gunners and mechanics.\n\nThe first aircraft ([[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter]]) was taken by the Lithuanian military from the Red Army, on February 5, 1919, at the city of [[Jieznas]].  On February 27, 1919, eight new reconnaissance aircraft, [[LVG C.VI]], were received. They had been purchased in Germany. In June, five more aircraft were purchased. In the following years some aircraft were taken as war booty and repaired in Lithuanian Aviation  workshops, many were purchased from various countries and a number were built by native designers [[Jurgis Dobkevi\u010dius]] and [[Antanas Gustaitis]].\n\nThe Lithuanian Military Aviation was active in battles with the Red Army and Polish military units. The pilot performing the most military sorties was Jurgis Dobkevi\u010dius, who later became the first Lithuanian aircraft designer and builder. On May 12, 1920, Vytautas Rauba was the first Lithuanian aviator to lose his life in an aircraft crash. On October 4 of the same year, in a fight with the Polish military, the first aircraft with a Lithuanian crew was shot down. The pilot of the aircraft, Juozas Kumpis, leader of Lithuania's First Air Squadron, was severely injured and died as prisoner of the Polish military.\n\nStarting in 1920 the military aviation branch was renamed a number of times and some time after 1928 it was named to the equivalent of the Lithuanian Air Force.\n\nThe Lithuanian Air Force supported and encouraged various aeronautics related activities, such as the sport of [[gliding]]. In 1933, in cooperation with [[Aero Club of Lithuania]], they helped establish a Lithuanian [[Gliding School in Nida]] and send their only experienced glider pilot, [[Gregorius Radvenis]], to be the school's instructor and supervisor.\n\nIn 1940, the Lithuanian Air Force consisted of eight Air Squadrons, including reconnaissance, fighter, bomber and training units. Air Force bases had been established in the cities and towns of [[Kaunas]] /\u017dagari\u0161k\u0117s, [[\u0160iauliai]] /Zokniai ([[Zokniai airfield]]), [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]] /[[Pajuostis]]. In the summer time, airports in the cities of [[Palanga]] and [[Rukla]] were also used. A total of 117 aircraft and 230 pilots and observers were listed in the books at that time.\n\n=== After 1992 ===\n[[File:Kauno tvirtove 2007-08-10.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of Lithuanian Air Force, Kaunas]]\nOn 23 January 1992, the [[Minister of Defense]] signed an order establishing the staff for the Aviation Base of the Aviation Service. But an actual base in the [[\u0160iauliai airport]] territory ([[Barysiai airfield]]) was not established until March, when according to the ordinance of the Government of Lithuanian Republic, all the infrastructure, buildings, territory and 24 [[An-2]] aircraft were passed from \u201d[[Lithuanian Airlines]]\" to the Aviation Service of the Ministry of Defense in January 1992.<br />On 12 June 1992, the first time after regaining the independence of Lithuania, An-2 aircraft, marked with the double cross of [[Vytis]] on its wings \u2013 the distinguishing sign of Lithuanian Air Force \u2013 took off from Barysiai airfield. This date is considered to be the Aviation Base foundation date. In February 1993 four L-39C Albatros aircraft were brought from Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAfter 1 March 1993 Aviation Service was reformed to the Lithuanian Air Force and Aviation Base was renamed the First Aviation Base of the Lithuanian Air Force. In January 1994 Lithuania officially applied for NATO membership. From 1995 to 1999, according to a decree of Lithuanian Government the First Aviation Base was relocated to [[Zokniai airfield]] nearby [[\u0160iauliai]], which was used for fighter wing, radio-electronic fight and reconnaissance squadrons dislocation during the [[Soviet occupation]].\n\nAccording to the decree of the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Lithuania [[Linas Linkevi\u010dius]], the First Aviation Base and the Second Aviation Base were reorganized into the Lithuanian Air Force Aviation Base as of 1 October 2004. Up to 2004, there were only light attack jet aircraft and transport aircraft located at the Air Base, after the reconstruction of First and Second Air Bases, helicopters are located at the Air Base too.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{Location map+ | Lithuania | relief = 1 | float=right | width=360| places=\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[\u0160iauliai International Airport|\u0160iauliai]]</small>|lat= 55.893889 |long= 23.394722 |position=left|mark=Green pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Karm\u0117lava]]</small>|lat= 54.972222 |long= 24.066667 |position=right|mark=Lightgreen pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Prienai|Antaver\u0161is]]</small>|lat= 54.633333 |long= 23.941667 |position=right|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[\u0160ilut\u0117|Degu\u010diai]]</small>|lat= 55.35 |long= 21.483333 |position=right|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Ignalina|Ceiki\u0161k\u0117s]]</small>|lat= 55.35 |long= 26.166667 |position=right|mark=Orange pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Lithuania | background = white |label=<small>[[Radvili\u0161kis]]</small>|lat= 55.8 |long= 23.55 |position=right|mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n|caption=Lithuanian Air Force locations 2018: <br/> [[File:Green pog.svg|10px]] Air Base [[File:Blue pog.svg|10px]] Air Defence Battalion <br/> [[File:Lightgreen pog.svg|10px]] Air Space Control Centre [[File:Orange pog.svg|10px]] [[AN/TPS-77|AN/TPS-77(V)]] Radar Station}}\n\nThe Lithuanian Air Force Headquarters and the [[Airspace Surveillance and Control Command (Lithuania)|Airspace Surveillance and Control Command]] are located in [[Kaunas]], while the Air Space Control Centre and the [[Baltic Air Surveillance Network]]'s Regional Airspace Surveillance Coordination Centre (RASCC) are located nearby in [[Karm\u0117lava]].

The [[Air defence battalion (Lithuania)|Air Defence Battalion]], formed in 2000, is located in [[Radvili\u0161kis]].\n\n=== Air Base ===\n{{main|\u0160iauliai International Airport}}\nThe main air base is located in [[\u0160iauliai]] city. It is manned with professional military and also non-military personnel. It consists of a headquarters, air operation group and operational support group. The base operates various fixed wing and rotary blade aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air Base of the Lithuanian Air Force |url=http://kariuomene.kam.lt/en/structure_1469/air_force/structure_1330/air_base.html |website=kariuomene.kam.lt |accessdate=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621115844/http://kariuomene.kam.lt/en/structure_1469/air_force/structure_1330/air_base.html |archive-date=21 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The staff, aircraft and equipment of the Air Base has participated in many international training missions abroad and at home.\nMain tasks of the Air Base are:\n* Host nation Support for [[NATO]] [[Baltic Air Policing]] forces;\n* [[Search and Rescue]];\n* Passenger, cargo and VIP transport;\n* Air medical evacuation;\n* Personnel deployment;\n* Army and Navy air support;\n* Air base personnel combat readiness training.\n\n=== Air Defence Battalion ===\n[[File:Eurocopter AS365+( kf 8984).jpg|thumb|Lithuanian Air Force [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin|AS365 Dauphin]]]]\n{{main|Air defence battalion (Lithuania)}}\nThe Air Defence Battalion\u2019s primary missions include:\n* Defend state facilities of vital importance against military aviation attacks from the air in low and medium altitude;\n* Support land forces in fighting against ground armoured technical equipment and in other events;\n* Train military personnel in carrying out combat tasks.\nDevelopment of infrastructure is one key missions of the Air Defence Battalion currently in the stage of development.\n\n=== Airspace Surveillance and Control Command ===\n{{main|Airspace Surveillance and Control Command (Lithuania)}}\nThe Airspace Surveillance and Control Command works closely with the Baltic States Air Surveillance System, [[BALTNET]]. The appropriate legal documentation of the BALTNET project was developed, the Reciprocal Memorandum of Understanding concerning military personnel training was signed among Lithuanian, Estonian, Latvian, and Danish Ministries of Defence.\nThe Regional Air Spaces Surveillance Co-ordination Centre (RASSCC), headquarters of the BALTNET project, was established in the LTAF Airspace Control Centre and has been fully functioning since early 2000. Military personnel from all the three [[Baltic States]] serve as air surveillance operators at the centre and rotate according to national timetables. The Commander of the centre is appointed for two years and represents one of the Baltic States.\n\n=== Armament and Equipment Repair Depot ===\n[[File:LAF Spartan 07.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian Air Force C-27J with an aerial refueling probe]]\nThe main tasks of Armament and Equipment Repair Depot:\n* To perform periodical works of maintenance as well as minor and medium repair of LAF armament and equipment outdoors;\n* To modernize LAF equipment according to contemporary aviation needs and NATO standards;\n* To prepare technical requirements for organizing competitions of centralized repair, modernization and purchasing of equipment;\n* To perform periodical works of maintenance, supervision and repair of life-saving equipment used in search and rescue works;\n* Under necessity, to perform works of maintenance and minor repair of special equipment of NATO partners, performing the function of air police in Lithuania. ;\n* Under necessity to provide proper room for ensuring minor repair operations of airplanes (QRA) of NATO partners;\n* Raise the level of military and professional staff preparation in order to be able in future perform periodic maintenance and repair of western type aircraft.\n\n== Baltic Air Policing ==\n{{main|Baltic Air Policing}}\nAfter Lithuania joined [[NATO]] organization back in 2004, its (alongside [[Latvia]]'s and [[Estonia]]'s) [[air space]] [[Baltic Air Policing|is protected by NATO]]. NATO members provide usually 4 [[fighter aircraft]], based in Lithuania, to police the [[Baltic States]]\u2019 airspace. The deployments rotate between NATO members (that started in March 2004 with [[Belgium Air Force]] [[F-16]]s) and most NATO members that operate fighters have made a deployment to Lithuania. The Baltic States are considering in the near future to protect their airspace on their own.\n\n== Modernisation ==\nIn line with the set priorities, the Lithuanian Air Force are implementing modernisation plans.\nSince Independence in 1991, the Lithuanian Air force has bought 3 new [[C-27J Spartan]] [[military transport aircraft]]. They have replaced the older [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era [[An-26]].<br />\nIn 2007, two [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39ZA]] aircraft underwent extension of technical resources in [[Romania]]. Maintenance works included exhaustive check-up of the aircraft units and major engine repairs. New navigation equipment GNS 530 was installed and radio communication sets changed in pilot cabins. These planes are used to train fighter control officers in air policing mission and fighter command officers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kam.lt/index.php/en/141712 |title=Air Force pilots fly L-39 ZA aircraft again (sic) |access-date=2009-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154658/http://www.kam.lt/index.php/en/141712 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nFurthermore, a complex program of capital overhaul, upgrade and modernisation of the Air Force's helicopters [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] and twin engine short-range transport aircraft [[L-410]] was conducted.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= National Defence Ministry Republic of Lithuania |title= Paie\u0161kos ir gelb\u0117jimo darbus vykdys kapitaliai suremontuotas sraigtasparnis |url= http://www.kam.lt/accessibility/index.php/lt/103737/ |language= lt }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher= National Defence Ministry Republic of Lithuania |title= Lithuanian manufacturers for the military |url= http://www.kam.lt/EasyAdmin/sys/files/Manufacturers.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2013, three [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin]] search and rescue helicopters were ordered from France for roughly 52 million euros.
