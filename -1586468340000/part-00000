Batting and throwing right-handed, he was a superb defensive infielder, as well as something of a clutch hitter, who played a large role in the Yankee baseball dynasty of his day. He is the only [[World Series MVP Award|World Series MVP]] ever to be selected from the losing team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_mvpw.shtml|title=World Series Most Valuable Player Award|work=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> He wore the uniform number 1 for the majority of his career (1958\u20131966).\n\n==Early life==\nRichardson was the middle child of Robert Sr. and Debbie Richardson of [[Sumter, South Carolina]]. He had two sisters, Inez (older) and Willie Ann (younger). Richardson Marble and Granite Works in Sumter was managed by Robert Sr., who also owned some of the interest in the company.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\nGrowing up, Richardson practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nRichardson started his [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] career with the [[Norfolk Tars]] of the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]], travelling by bus to Norfolk from Sumter with $85 in coins friends and family had given him.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Pasculli|first=Len|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/47363efd|title=Bobby Richardson|work=SABR|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRichardson debuted on August 5, 1955. He racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s. Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 73 [[stolen base]]s. He also had 196 [[double (baseball)|double]]s and 37 [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s.\n\n===Baseball highlights===\nHis best year was probably {{Baseball year|1962}}, when he batted .302 with 8 home runs and 59 runs batted in. His 209 hits led the [[American League]], and he stole 11 bases in 161 games. He made the AL [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team, won his second Gold Glove, and came in second in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|AL MVP]] voting, just behind teammate [[Mickey Mantle]]. \n\nHe also led the league in at bats three times, partly because he batted early in the order and partly because he rarely missed a game, coming to be known as a workhorse. His career high was 692 at bats in 161 games in 1962.\n\nHe had an all-time [[fielding percentage]] of .979 at second base, and six seasons with 100 or more double plays turned.\n\n===Postseason===\nRichardson won three [[World Series]] ([[1958 World Series|1958]], [[1961 World Series|1961]], [[1962 World Series|1962]]) of the seven he played with the Yankees ([[1957 World Series|1957]], 1958, [[1960 World Series|1960]], 1961, 1962, [[1963 World Series|1963]], [[1964 World Series|1964]]). In the 1960 Series, Richardson was named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] after hitting .367 with 12 RBIs, becoming the first non-pitcher to earn the relatively new award, and is to this day the only MVP to play for the losing team. The Yankees gave him a new Corvette for his efforts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Emery|url=https://thetandd.com/sports/t-d-sunday-conversation-with-bobby-richardson/article_378fc5f2-52ab-11e0-815b-001cc4c03286.html|title=T&D Sunday Conversation with...Bobby Richardson|work=The Times & Democrat|date=March 20, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Two years later, he caught the final out of the 1962 Series; hardly moving from his position, he snared a screaming line drive off the bat of [[Willie McCovey]], which, if it had been two or three feet higher would have won the Series for the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\n[[File:Bobby Richardson 1963.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Richardson in 1963.]]\nIn Game One of the [[1963 World Series]], which the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] swept in four games over the Yankees, Richardson struck out three times against [[Sandy Koufax]]\u2014his only three-strikeout game in 1,448 regular-season/World Series games. (Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out twice in one game.\n\nIn the [[1964 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by [[Lou Brock]] and [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the [[1968 World Series|1968]] and [[1986 World Series]], respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the 7th and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133.

He had two sisters, Inez (older) and Willie Ann (younger). Richardson Marble and Granite Works in Sumter was managed by Robert Sr., who also owned some of the interest in the company.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\nGrowing up, Richardson practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cininnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nRichardson started his [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] career with the [[Norfolk Tars]] of the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]], travelling by bus to Norfolk from Sumter with $85 in coins friends and family had given him.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Pasculli|first=Len|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/47363efd|title=Bobby Richardson|work=SABR|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRichardson debuted on August 5, 1955. He racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s. Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 73 [[stolen base]]s. He also had 196 [[double (baseball)|double]]s and 37 [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s.\n\n===Baseball highlights===\nHis best year was probably {{Baseball year|1962}}, when he batted .302 with 8 home runs and 59 runs batted in. His 209 hits led the [[American League]], and he stole 11 bases in 161 games. He made the AL [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team, won his second Gold Glove, and came in second in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|AL MVP]] voting, just behind teammate [[Mickey Mantle]]. \n\nHe also led the league in at bats three times, partly because he batted early in the order and partly because he rarely missed a game, coming to be known as a workhorse. His career high was 692 at bats in 161 games in 1962.\n\nHe had an all-time [[fielding percentage]] of .979 at second base, and six seasons with 100 or more double plays turned.\n\n===Postseason===\nRichardson won three [[World Series]] ([[1958 World Series|1958]], [[1961 World Series|1961]], [[1962 World Series|1962]]) of the seven he played with the Yankees ([[1957 World Series|1957]], 1958, [[1960 World Series|1960]], 1961, 1962, [[1963 World Series|1963]], [[1964 World Series|1964]]). In the 1960 Series, Richardson was named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] after hitting .367 with 12 RBIs, becoming the first non-pitcher to earn the relatively new award, and is to this day the only MVP to play for the losing team.

(Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out twice in one game.\n\nIn the [[1964 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by [[Lou Brock]] and [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the [[1968 World Series|1968]] and [[1986 World Series]], respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the 7th and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage.

General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William \"Bill\" Slim]]'s plan through the monsoon months had been pursuit of the defeated Japanese in [[Kohima]] and plains of [[Imphal]] with [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] down the Tiddim Road and [[11th East African Division]] down the [[Kabaw Valley]], until the two joined at Kalemyo. The next offensive plan centred on the occupation of Central Burma, as far south as [[Mandalay]] to exploit further south and destroy the Japanese forces in the Shewbo Plains, north of [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]], where armour could be used. Allied forces crossed River Chindwin and the spearheads of both corps of the Fourteenth Army (IV and XXXIII Corps) were moving into selected battle areas, which surprised the Japanese as they had not anticipated any major operations during the monsoon period. The British Fourteenth Army was now faced with a major obstacle (the Irrawaddy) covered by determined Japanese. The Irrawaddy River in its middle is about {{convert|2000|yd|m}} broad and dotted with treacherous and shifting sand bars. An opposed direct crossing would have been very expensive with low percentage of success.\n\n== Offensive Plan ==\nThe new situation required a different plan, revolving under surprise and crossing of the [[Irrawaddy River]] for fighting major battles in the plains around [[Mandalay]] and in the low hills of Meiktila. Since there was not enough equipment to make an opposed river crossing, Slim planned more than one crossing with adequate deception plans as to where the real assault in strength was to take place. It was decided to make sufficiently strong crossing north of Mandalay to draw main enemy forces, while making the main crossing in the south of Japanese concentrations below Mandalay. The revised plan pertaining to [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] was IV Corps less 19th Division (7th Indian Division, [[17th Indian Infantry Division]], 28th East African Brigade, Lushai Brigade, and [[255th Indian Tank Brigade]]) to move due south, down the Gangaw valley for nearly 300 miles, seize a bridgehead on Irrawaddy at Pakokku and then strike southeast with mechanised forces at Meiktila and Thazi, with air maintenance.\n\n=== 7th Division Plan ===\nThe next operation across the Irrawaddy River was to be a magnificent stroke of bravery and deception, that was to make possible the destruction of the Japanese army in Burma. This involved advance through Gangaw Valley and crossing of Irrawaddy River at [[Nyaung U]]. Thereafter a quick thrust would be made towards [[Meiktila]], the capture of which was to cut off the Japanese that were fighting in the northern and central Burma. The operation of the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] was initiated by [[114th Indian Infantry Brigade]] which moved to [[Tamu, Burma|Tamu]], constructing a stretch of 180 miles (over 280 Kilometres) of motorable road from Tamu to [[Gangaw]] in 15 days. 114th Brigade and Divisional Headquarters moved along the main axis [[Kalaymyo|Kaley Valley]] road. The advance was to begin on 19 January 1945 and the 7 Indian Infantry Divisional tasks were:\n* Advance and seize the Pauk area up to and including crossing of Yaw Chaung by not later than 1 February 1945.\n* To seize a bridgehead over the Irrawaddy between Chauk and Pakokku suitable for advance to [[Meiktila]] by not later than 15 February 1945.\n\n== Battle of Pakokku ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}\nThe Japanese had been defeated in the Battles of [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] and [[Imphal]] and the offensive to destroy Japanese forces north of the Irrawaddy River was planned with a surprise crossing of the river. The 7th Indian Infantry Division and other formations were to seize a bridgehead on Irrawaddy at Pakokku by 15 February 1945 and move southeast with mechanised forces. The operations of the 7th Division were initiated by 114 Indian Infantry Brigade, which was led by the [[5GR|4th Battalion, 5 Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] (4/5 GR). The battalion left Merema on 4 December 1944, and reached the area on 3 February 1945; it closed on the given objective at Pakokku on 5 February 1945, after C Company, under Major Beytagh, cleared the road. The Japanese shelled the troops from their positions in Kahnla, a village on the southern bank of the Irrawaddy.\n\nOn 5 February, three companies of 4/5 GR, led by Captain Fisher, Major I.M Brown [[Military Cross|MC]]* and the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel J H Turner, made an encircling move on the village of Kahnla. One company moved further left and attacked from northeast, after coming under intense Japanese attack, while a second company formed up in Kahnla village for the attack from west; with H-hour at 5:30&nbsp;pm, it fought its way through and overran half of the Japanese position, including a strong [[Medium Machine Gun]] (MMG) bunker. Not less than 30 Japanese were killed and many more wounded, while two MMGs, three [[Light Machine Gun]]s (LMGs) and twenty rifles were recovered. One of the battalion\u2019s wounded was CHM Bhagta Bahadur Gurung, whose outstanding courage and leadership in the attack later saw him awarded the [[Indian Order of Merit]] (IOM). Brown was awarded another Bar to his MC. These were two of the 41 major awards won by 4/5 GR during operations in [[China Burma India Theater|Burma Theatre]] during World War II.\n\nFurther reconnaissance on 6 February indicated that the remainder of the objective was strongly held by the Japanese and on 7 February the [[1GR|4th Battalion/1 Gurkha Rifles]] (4/1 GR) established a firm base for 4/5 GR. On 8 February, the Brown's company cleared another Japanese position, killing twelve and wounding three Japanese. The main attack planned for early morning hours of 10 February, was pressed without any aerial support due to bad weather. The attack began with one company moving forward with support from tanks from the [[255th Indian Tank Brigade]] ([[Gordon Highlanders]]). By the afternoon, they had captured their objective. 4/5 GR suffered a significant loss during the battle when its commanding officer of the battalion was killed. Resistance by the Japanese position was fanatical; only one prisoner was taken and 51 bodies counted. During night 10 February 1945, the Japanese launched six unsuccessful counterattacks and on the night of 11/12 February 1945, they tried to infiltrate into 4/5 GR's position without success. On the night of 13 February, troops from 4/5 GR occupied positions closer to Pakokku Village, called Sinlan, then proceeded to search and occupy Pakokku itself. With this operation decimating nearly battalion strength of Japanese, the first stage of 7 Indian Infantry Division task was completed and foothold gained on the western bank of the Irrawaddy, for further operations. The operation was magnificent stroke of bravery and deception, making possible the next phase of offensive for the destruction of Japanese in Burma.\n\n== Irrawaddy River operations ==\n[[File:Men of the Dorset Regiment, 2nd Division, crossing the Irrawaddy river at Ngazun, Burma, 28 February 1945. SE3153.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Men of the Dorset Regiment crossing the Irrawaddy River]]\nAfter the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] had captured Pakokku, on 14 February, the Allied forces crossed the Irrawaddy River at Nyaung U, north of ancient Burmese capital of Pagan. The 7th Division's crossing was made on a wide front. Both the main attack at [[Nyaung U]] and a secondary crossing at [[Bagan|Pagan]] (the former capital, and the site of many [[Buddhist]] temples) were initially disastrous. Pagan and Nyaungu were defended by two battalions of the [[Indian National Army]]'s 4th Guerrilla Regiment, with one held in reserve.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=330}}</ref> The 7th Indian Division suffered heavy losses as their assault boats broke down under machine-gun fire which swept the river.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=332}}</ref> Eventually, support from tanks of the [[Gordon Highlanders]] firing across the river and massed artillery forced the defenders at Nyaungu to surrender. At Pagan, the defending troops, the INA's 9th Battalion took a heavy toll offering resistance to the (1/[[11th Sikh Regiment]]) before they withdrew to [[Mount Popa]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=333}}</ref>\n\nBy 20 February, most of the forces crossed the river and captured [[Battle of Meiktila|Meiktila]], as planned. The capture of Pakokku by 4/5 GR opened the way for further operations by the [[17th Indian Infantry Division]]. On 19 February, 4/5 GR cleared an island, {{convert|5|mi|km}} long and {{convert|3|mi|km}} broad, in the Irrawaddy River, off Pakokku, which was interfering with forward movement.\n\nOn 24 February, the Gurkhas moved south of Pakokku, crossed Irrawaddy River and took over part of Nyaung U bridgehead. On 25 February, a squadron of the 116th Regiment RAC (Gordon Highlanders), part of the 255th Indian Tank Brigade, supported the assault of the battalion and the village was soon secured; seven Japanese, including one officer, were killed. Throughout the month of April, the Allies continued to engage the Japanese in the area and this led to the capture of Letse and Seikpyu. On the morning of 24 April, leading troops were pinned down with heavy fire from a ridge with a prominent Golden Pagoda and a monastery. The objective was captured by a company from 4/5 GR, under Captain G W Maycock, supported by a heavy artillery concentration. Thirty-nine Japanese bodies were recovered. By 30 April, 4/5 GR secured Pwinbu and then moved to clear the Japanese position at Pagan village. Between 5 and 8 May concerted assaults were launched on Japanese positions which formed a ring around the position from the south: on 6th, roadblock in the rear of the Japanese on 7th and assault launched on Pagan Village on 8th.\n\n== Victory ==\nWhile these subsidiary operations, minor in comparison, had been taking place west of the Irrawaddy River, the [[Battle of Meiktila / Mandalay|Battle of Mandalay]] had been fought out. The Japanese had been decisively and finally beaten. The [[Burma Area Army|Japanese Army in Burma]] except for those troops still east of Sittang River had ceased to exist as an organised and integrated force. On 2 May 1945 Rangoon had been reoccupied and General Slim's plans had been brought to a triumphant conclusion. The monsoon was about to break and the next phase was to be a large scale mopping up operation. On 14 May, 4/5 GR left Pagan for what it hoped would be a fairly permanent monsoon location. After several changes of location, it arrived at Allanmyo, {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of Prome. Orders were soon received on 27 May to move to Prome for further operational tasks.\n\nAs a result of its involvement in this battle, the [[Battle Honour]] \"Irrawaddy\" was awarded to 4/5 GR.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.defenceindia.com/defenceind/battle_Pakokku.html Brigadier Ratan Kaul's description of the Battle of Pakokku and the Irrawaddy River operations]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [[Jon Latimer]], ''Burma: The Forgotten War'', London: John Murray, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7195-6576-6}}\n\n{{Indian National Army}}\n{{coord missing|Myanmar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle of Pokoku And Irrawaddy River Operations}}\n[[Category:South-East Asian theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving India]]\n[[Category:Military history of Burma during World War II]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 in Burma]]\n[[Category:Land battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Battle of Pakokku and Irrawaddy River\n|image=A Lee tank being loaded onto a pontoon ferry by men of the 2nd Division before crossing the Irrawaddy river at Ngazun, Burma, 28 February 1945.

The battles and operations were instrumental in facilitating the eventual capture of [[Rangoon]] in summer 1945.\n\n== Preparation ==\nThe [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 31st Division]]'s thrust [[Battle of Kohima|at Kohima]] had been a costly failure, eventually forcing it to a disastrous retreat. The [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 33rd Division]], [[15th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 15th Division]] and the [[Indian National Army|INA 1st Division]] had suffered a similar fate [[Battle of Imphal|at Imphal]]. The Japanese and their allied forces lost at least fifty thousand dead.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In previous years there used to be lull during the monsoon period but not this year (1944\u201345).
