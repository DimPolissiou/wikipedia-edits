{"title_page": "Music of Nigeria", "text_new": "{{Music of Nigeria}}\n{{Culture of Nigeria}}\n\nThe '''music of Nigeria''' includes many kinds of [[Traditional music|folk]] and [[popular music]], some of which are known worldwide. Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of [[Demographics of Nigeria#Ethnic groups|ethnic groups]] in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. Little is known about the country's music history prior to European contact, although [[bronze]] carvings dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries have been found depicting musicians and their instruments.<ref>Karolyi, pg. 4</ref> The largest ethnic groups are the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. Traditional music from Nigeria and throughout Africa is almost always functional; in other words, it is performed to mark a ritual such as a [[wedding]] or [[funeral]] and not to achieve artistic goals.<ref>Titon. P. 70</ref> Although some Nigerians, especially children and the elderly, play instruments for their own amusement, solo performance is otherwise rare. Music is closely linked to [[agriculture]], and there are restrictions on, for example, which instruments can be played during different parts of the growing season.\n\n[[Work song]]s are a common type of traditional Nigerian music. They help to keep the rhythm of workers in fields, river canoes and other fields. Women use complex rhythms in housekeeping tasks, such as pounding [[yam (vegetable)|yams]] to highly ornamented music. In the northern regions, farmers work together on each other's farms and the host is expected to supply musicians for his neighbours.\n\nThe issue of musical composition is also highly variable. The [[Hwana]], for example, believe that all songs are taught by the peoples' ancestors, while the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] give credit to named composers for almost all songs, and the [[Efik people|Efik]] name individual composers only for secular songs. In many parts of Nigeria, musicians are allowed to say things in their lyrics that would otherwise be perceived as offensive. <!-- examples? -->\n\nThe most common format for music in Nigeria is the [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] choir, in which a lead singer and a chorus interchange verses, sometimes accompanied by instruments that either shadow the lead text or repeat and [[ostinato]] vocal phrase. The southern area features complex rhythms and solo players using melody instruments, while the north more typically features polyphonic wind ensembles. The extreme north region is associated with [[monody|monodic]] (i.e., single-line) music with an emphasis on drums, and tends to be more influenced by [[Islamic music]].\n\n==Traditional music==\n=== Hausa ===\n\n{{Main|Hausa music}}\n\nThe people of the North are known for complex percussion instrument music, the one-stringed [[goje]], and a strong praise song vocal tradition. Under Muslim influence since the 14th century, Hausa music uses free-rhythmic improvisation and the [[Pentatonic scale]], similar to other Muslim [[Sahelian]] tribes throughout West Africa, such as the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Fulani]] and [[Songhai people|Songhai]]. Traditional Hausa music is used to celebrate births, marriages, circumcisions, and other important life events. Hausa ceremonial music is well known in the area and is dominated by families of praise singers. The Hausa play percussion instruments such as the [[tambura drum]] and the [[talking drum]]. The most impressive of the Hausa state instruments, however, is the elongated state trumpet called [[Kakaki]], which was originally used by the [[Songhai people|Songhai]] cavalry and was taken by the rising Hausa states as a symbol of military power. Kakaki trumpets can be more than two metres long, and can be easily broken down into three portable parts for easy transportation.\n\n=== Igbo ===\n\n{{Main|Igbo music}}\n\nThe [[Igbo people]] live in the south-east of Nigeria, and play a wide variety of folk instruments. They are known for their ready adoption of foreign styles, and were an important part of Nigerian highlife.<ref>Graham, pg. 589 Graham describes both the receptivity of the Igbo to foreign influences, as well as the use of the ''obo''</ref> The most widespread instrument is the 13-stringed [[zither]], called an ''[[obo]]''. The Igbo also play [[slit drum]]s, [[xylophone]]s, [[flute]]s, [[lyre]]s, [[udu]]s and lutes, and more recently, imported European [[brass instrument]]s.\n\nCourtly music is played among the more traditional Igbo, maintaining their royal traditions. The ''ufie'' ([[slit drum]]) is used to wake the chief and communicate meal times and other important information to him. Bell and drum ensembles are used to announce when the chief departs and returns to his village. Meal times may include pie, and other dessert foods for the holidays.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham</ref>\n\n=== Yoruba ===\n\n{{Main|Yoruba music}} \n\nThe [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] have a [[drum]]ming tradition, with a characteristic use of the [[Talking drum|dundun]] hourglass [[tension drums]]. Ensembles using the dundun play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.<ref name=\"africanchorus.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.africanchorus.org/Voam/Voam624.htm |title=The Orchestra in the African Context |publisher=Africanchorus.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> These ensembles consist of various sizes of tension drums, along with kettledrums (''gudugudu''). The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''iyalu'', who uses the drum to \"talk\" by imitating the tonality of [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Much of Yoruba music is spiritual in nature, and is devoted to their God.\n\nYoruba music has become the most important component of modern Nigerian popular music, as a result of its early influence from European, Islamic and Brazilian forms. These influences stemmed from the importation of [[brass instrument]]s, [[sheet music]], Islamic percussion and styles brought by Brazilian merchants.<ref>Graham, pg. 589 Graham claims the source of the Brazilian influence was the ''influential Brazilian merchant community of the early 19th century.''</ref> In both the Nigeria's most populous city, [[Lagos]], and the largest city of [[Ibadan]], these multicultural traditions were brought together and became the root of Nigerian popular music. Modern styles such as [[Ayinde Barrister]]'s [[fuji music|fuji]], [[Salawa Abeni]]'s [[waka music|waka]] and [[Yusuf Olatunji]]'s [[sakara music|sakara]] are derived primarily from Yoruba traditional music.Yoruba music have now come of age and the new generation of Nigerian music now sing in their native language. 9ice is one of many that broke into the industry with Gongo Aso and many more artist followed. Listening to [[Timi Korus]] Babe mi Jowo and Flosha denotes artist home and abroad now rap and sing in yoruba and not forgetting their heritage.\n\n== Theatrical music ==\n\nNigerian theatre makes extensive use of music. Often, this is simply traditional music used in a theatrical production without adaptation. However, there are also distinct styles of music used in Nigerian [[opera]]. Here, music is used to convey an impression of the dramatic action to the audience. Music is also used in literary drama, although its musical accompaniment is more sparingly used than in opera; again, music communicates the mood or tone of events to the audience. An example is [[John Pepper Clark]]'s ''[[The Ozidi Saga]]'', a play about murder and revenge, featuring both human and non-human actors. Each character in the play is associated with a personal theme song, which accompanies battles in which the character is involved.\n\nTraditional Nigerian theatre includes [[puppetry|puppet]] shows in [[Borno State]] and among the Ogoni and Tiv, and the ancient Yoruba [[Al\u00e1\u00e0r\u00ecnj\u00f3]] tradition, which may be descended from the [[Eg\u00fang\u00fan]] masquerade. With the influx of road-building colonial powers, these theatre groups spread across the country and their productions grew ever more elaborate. They now typically use European instruments, film extracts and recorded music.\n\nIn the past, both [[Hubert Ogunde]] and [[Ade Love]], of blessed memories, produced soundtracks of their movies using very rich [[Yoruba language]]. Modern day Yoruba film and theater music composers among whom [[Tope Alabi]] is the flagbearer have variously accompanied dramatic actions with original music.\n\n== Children's music ==\n\nChildren in Nigeria have many of their own traditions, usually singing [[game]]s. These are most often call-and-response type songs, using archaic language. There are other songs, such as among the [[Tarok]] people that are sexually explicit and obscene, and are only performed far away from the home. Children also use instruments like [[untuned percussion|un-pitched]] [[raft zither]]s (made from cornstalks) and [[drum kit|drums]] made from tin cans, a pipe made from a [[papaya|pawpaw]] stem and a [[jaw harp]] made from a [[sorghum]] stalk. Among the Hausa, children play a unique instrument in which they beat rhythms on the inflated stomach of a live, irritated [[pufferfish]].\n\n== Traditional instruments ==\n\nAlthough percussion instruments are omnipresent, Nigeria's traditional music uses a number of diverse instruments. Many, such as the [[xylophone]], are an integral part of music across West Africa, while others are imports from the Muslims of the [[Maghreb]], or from Southern or East Africa; other instruments have arrived from Europe or the Americas. Brass instruments and woodwinds were early imports that played a vital role in the development of Nigerian music, while the later importation of electric guitars spurred the popularisation of j\u00f9j\u00fa music.\n\n=== Percussion ===\n\n[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|left|Drummers in [[Ojumo Oro]], [[Kwara State]]]]\nThe xylophone is a tuned [[idiophone]], common throughout west and central Africa. In Nigeria, they are most common in the southern part of the country, and are of the central African model. Several people sometimes simultaneously play a single xylophone. The instruments are usually made of loose wood placed across banana logs. Pit- and box-resonated xylophones are also found. Ensembles of clay pots beaten with a soft pad are common; they are sometimes filled with water. Although normally tuned, untuned examples are sometimes used to produce a bass rhythm. Hollow logs are also used, split lengthways, with resonator holes at the end of the slit. They were traditionally used to communicate over great distances.\n\nVarious bells are a common part of royal regalia, and were used in [[secret society|secret societies]]. They are usually made of iron, or in Islamic orchestras of the north, of bronze. Struck gourds, placed on a cloth and struck with sticks, are a part of women's music, as well as the [[b\u00f2\u00f2r\u00ed\u00ed]] cult dances. Sometimes, especially in the north, gourds are placed upside-down in water, with the pitch adjusted by the amount of air underneath it. In the south-west, a number of tuned gourds are played while floating in a trough.\n\nScrapers are common throughout the south. One of the most common types is a notched stick, played by dragging a shell across the stick at various speeds. It is used both as a women's court instrument and by children in teasing games. Among the Yoruba, an iron rod may be used as a replacement for a stick. Rattles are common, made of gourds containing seeds or stones are common, as are net-rattles, in which a string network of beads or shells encloses a gourd. Rattles are typically played in ritual or religious context, predominantly by women.\n\nDrums of many kinds are the most common type of percussion instrument in Nigeria. They are traditionally made from a single piece of wood or spherical calabashes, but have more recently been made from oil drums. The hourglass drum is the most common shape, although there are also double-headed barrel drums, single-headed drums and conical drums. [[Frame drum]]s are also found in Nigeria, but may be an importation from Brazil. An unusual percussion instrument is the [[udu]], a kind of vessel drum.\nThis instrument is very essential in most African countries.\n\n=== String instruments ===\n\nThe [[musical bow]] is found in Nigeria as a mouth-resonated cord, either plucked or struck. It is most common in the central part of the country, and is associated with agricultural songs and those expressing social concerns. Cereal stalks bound together and strings supported by two bridges are used to make a kind of raft-zither, played with the thumbs, typically for solo entertainment. The arched harp is found in the eastern part of the country, especially among the Tarok. It usually has five or six strings and pentatonic tuning. A bowl-resonated spike-fiddle with a lizard skin table is used in the northern region, and is similar to central Asian and Ethiopian forms. The Hausa and Kanuri peoples play a variety of spike-lutes.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\n\nA variety of [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[woodwind instrument]]s are also found in Nigeria. These include long [[trumpet]]s, frequently made of [[aluminium]] and played in pairs or ensembles of up to six, often accompanied by a [[shawm]]. Wooden trumpets, gourd trumpets, end-blown flutes, cruciform whistles, transverse clarinets and various kinds of horns are also found.\n\n== Popular music ==\nMany African countries have seen turbulence and violence during their forced transition from a diverse region of folk cultures to a group of modern nation states. Nigeria has experienced more difficulty than most African countries in forging a popular cultural identity from the diverse peoples of the countryside.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/5/Nigeria/ |title=Afropop Nigeria |publisher=Afropop.org |accessdate=2010-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616034252/http://afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/5/Nigeria/ |archivedate=2010-06-16 }}</ref> <!-- brief explanation? --> From its beginnings in the streets of Lagos, popular music in Nigeria has long been an integral part of the field of African pop, bringing in influences and instruments from many ethnic groups, most prominently including the Yoruba.\n\nThe earliest styles of Nigerian popular music were [[palm-wine music]] and [[highlife]], which spread in the 1920s among Nigeria and nearby countries of [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Ghana]]. In Nigeria, palm-wine became the primary basis for [[j\u00f9j\u00fa music|j\u00f9j\u00fa]], a genre that dominated popular music for many years. During this time, a few other styles such as [[apala]], derived from traditional Yoruba music, also found a more limited audience. By the 1960s, Cuban, American and other styles of imported music were enjoying a large following, and musicians started to incorporate these influences into j\u00f9j\u00fa. The result was a profusion of new styles in the last few decades of the 20th century, including [[waka music]], [[Yo-pop]] and [[Afrobeat]].\n\n=== Palm-wine and the invention of j\u00f9j\u00fa ===\n{{Main|Palm-wine music}}\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, Yoruba music had incorporated brass instruments, written notation, Islamic percussion and new Brazilian techniques, resulting in the [[Lagos]]-born [[palm-wine music|palm-wine]] style. The term ''palm-wine'' is also used to describe related genres in [[Sierra Leone]], Liberia and [[Ghana]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/> these varieties are better-known than Nigerian palm-wine. However, ''palm-wine'' originally referred to a diverse set of styles played with [[string instrument]]s, characteristically, [[guitar]]s or [[banjo]]s) with [[shaker (percussion)|shakers]] and hand [[drum]]s accompanying<ref name=\"afropop.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/18/Juju/ |title=Afropop Juju |publisher=Afropop.org |accessdate=2010-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073525/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/18/Juju/ |archivedate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> This urban style was frequently played in bars to accompany drinking (hence the name, which is derived from the alcoholic [[palm wine]] beverage).\n\nThe first stars of palm-wine had emerged by the 1920s, the most famous of whom was [[Tunde King|Baba Tunde King]]. King probably coined the word ''j\u00f9j\u00fa'' \u2014 a style of music he helped to create \u2014 in reference to the sound of a Brazilian [[tambourine]]; alternatively, the term may have developed as an expression of disdain by the colonial leaders (any native tradition was apt to be dismissed as 'mere ''joujou'', French for \"nonsense\").<ref>Graham, pg. 590 Graham claims that the word ''juju'' was a ''mild expression of colonial disparagement &mdash; musical mumbo jumbo &mdash; taken up by j\u00f9j\u00fa musicians themselves to subvert it. And ''jojo'' also happens to be Yoruba for ''dance''.''</ref> By the early 1930s, British [[record label]]s such as [[HMV|His Master's Voice]] had started to record palm-wine, and more celebrities emerged, including [[Ojoge Daniel]], [[Tunde Nightingale]] and [[Speedy Araba]]. These artists, along with Tunde King, established the core of the style<ref name=\"afropop.org\"/> which was called [[j\u00f9j\u00fa music|j\u00f9j\u00fa]], and remained one of the most popular genres in Nigeria throughout the 20th century. Some J\u00f9j\u00fa musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the \"blind minstrel\" [[Kokoro (musician)|Kokoro]].<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Culture and customs of Nigeria\n |author=Toyin Falola\n |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group\n |year=2001\n |ISBN=0-313-31338-5\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00falo/page/173 173]\n |url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00falo/page/173\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Apala ===\n{{Main|Apala}}\n\nApala is a style of vocal and percussive Muslim Yoruba music. It emerged in the late 1930s as a means of rousing worshippers after the fasting of [[Ramadan]]. Under the influence of popular [[music of Cuba|Afro-Cuban percussion]], apala developed into a more polished style and attracted a large audience. The music required two or three talking drums (''omele''), a rattle (''sekere''), thumb piano (''agidigbo'') and a bell (''agogo''). [[Haruna Ishola]] was the most famous apala performer, and he later played an integral role in bringing apala to larger audiences as a part of [[fuji music]].<ref>Afropop: Apala Afropop cites this claim as ''(m)usicologist Chris Waterman suggests that the influence of Afro-Cuban percussion recordings was also formative in refining the music's presentation, although not its rhythms and forms''. Afropop further specifies that, though the other instruments mentioned are common throughout Nigerian popular music, the use of the ''agidigbo'' is unusual and peculiar to apala</ref>\n\n=== The 1950s, '60s and '70s ===\nFollowing World War II, Nigerian music started to take on new instruments and techniques, including electric instruments imported from the United States and Europe. [[Rock N' roll]], [[soul music|soul]], and later [[funk]], became very popular in Nigeria, and elements of these genres were added to j\u00f9j\u00fa by artists such as [[I. K. Dairo|IK Dairo]]. Meanwhile, highlife had been slowly gaining in popularity among the Igbo people, and their unique style soon found a national audience. At the same time, [[apala]]'s [[Haruna Ishola]] was becoming one of the country's biggest stars. In the early to mid-1970s, three of the biggest names in Nigerian music history were at their peak: [[Fela Kuti]], [[Ebenezer Obey]] and [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], while the end of that decade saw the start of [[Yo-pop]] and [[Nigerian reggae]].\n\nAlthough popular styles such as highlife and j\u00f9j\u00fa were at the top of the Nigerian charts in the '60s, traditional music remained widespread. Traditional stars included the Hausa [[Dan Maraya]], who was so well known that he was brought to the battlefield during the 1967 [[Nigerian Civil War]] to lift the morale of the federal troops.\n\n==== Modernisation of J\u00f9j\u00fa ====\n{{Main|J\u00f9j\u00fa music}}\n[[File:IKDairo.png|thumb|I.K. Dairo]]\n\nFollowing World War II, [[Tunde Nightingale]]'s [[s'o wa mbe]] style made him one of the first j\u00f9j\u00fa stars, and he introduced more Westernised pop influences to the genre. During the 1950s, recording technology grew more advanced, and the gangan [[talking drum]], [[electric guitar]] and [[accordion]] were incorporated into j\u00f9j\u00fa. Much of this innovation was the work of [[IK Dairo & the Morning Star Orchestra]] (later ''IK Dairo & the Blue Spots''), which formed in 1957.<ref name=\"afropop.org\"/> these performers brought j\u00f9j\u00fa from the rural poor to the urban cities of Nigeria and beyond. Dairo became perhaps the biggest star of African music by the '60s, recording numerous hit songs that spread his fame to as far away as Japan. In 1963, he became the only African musician ever honoured by receiving membership of the [[Order of the British Empire]], an [[order of chivalry]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n==== Dispersion of highlife ====\n{{Main|Highlife}}\n\nAmong the Igbo people, Ghanaian [[highlife]] became popular in the early 1950s, and other guitar-band styles from [[Cameroon]] and [[Zaire]] soon followed. The Ghanaian [[E. T. Mensah]], easily the most popular highlife performer of the 1950s, toured Igbo-land frequently, drawing huge crowds of devoted fans. [[Bobby Benson]] & His Combo was the first Nigerian highlife band to find audiences across the country. Benson was followed by [[Jim Lawson & the Mayor's Dance Band]], who achieved national fame in the mid-'70s, ending with Lawson's death in 1971. During the same period, other highlife performers were reaching their peak. These included [[Prince Nico Mbarga]] and his band Rocafil Jazz, whose \"[[Sweet Mother]]\" was a pan-African hit that sold more than 13 million copies, more than any other African single of any kind. Mbarga used English lyrics in a style that he dubbed [[panko]], which incorporated \"sophisticated [[African Rumba|rumba]] guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom\".<ref>Graham, pgs. 596\u2013597 Graham explains the importance of both Benson and Lawson. Referring to \"Sweet Mother, Graham explains: ''(b)ut it is an infectious song and its potent appeal was concocted from Mbarga's use of pidgin English (broadening his audience enormously) and a style he called ''panko'' &mdash; for the first time incorporating sophisticated rumba guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom.''</ref>\n\nAfter the civil war in the 1960s, Igbo musicians were forced out of Lagos and returned to their homeland. The result was that highlife ceased to be a major part of mainstream Nigerian music, and was thought of as being something purely associated with the Igbos of the east. Highlife's popularity slowly dwindled among the Igbos, supplanted by j\u00f9j\u00fa and fuji. However, a few performers kept the style alive, such as Yoruba singer and trumpeter [[Victor Olaiya]] (the only Nigerian to ever earn a platinum record), [[Stephen Osita Osadebe]], [[Oliver De Coque]], [[Celestine Ukwu]], [[Oriental Brothers]], [[Sonny Okosun]], [[Victor Uwaifo]], and [[Orlando Owoh|Orlando \"Dr. Ganja\" Owoh]], whose distinctive toye style fused j\u00f9j\u00fa and highlife.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n{{listen|filename=PrinceNicoMbargaSweetMother.ogg|title=Prince Nico Mbarga's \"Sweet Mother\"|description=\"Sweet Mother\" was a best-selling single across Africa}}\n\n==== Birth of fuji ====\n{{Main|Fuji music}}\n\n[[Apala]], a traditional style from Ogun state, one of yoruba state in Nigeria, became very popular in the 1960s, led by performers like [[Haruna Ishola]], Sefiu Ayan, Kasumu Adio, and Ayinla Omowura. Ishola, who was one of Nigeria's most consistent hit makers between 1955 and his death in 1983, recorded apala songs, which alternated between slow and emotional, and swift and energetic. His lyrics were a mixture of improvised praise and passages from the [[Quran]], as well as traditional [[proverb]]s. His work became a formative influence on the developing fuji style.\n\nThe late 1960s saw the appearance of the first fuji bands. Fuji was named after [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan, purely for the sound of the word, according to [[Ayinde Barrister]].<ref>Graham, pg. 593 Graham does not cite a specific source for the claim by Sikiru Barrister</ref> Fuji was a synthesis of apala with the \"ornamented, free-rhythmic\" vocals of ''[[ajisari]]'' devotional musicians<ref>Arab World Information, \"Popular Fuji Music of Nigeria\"</ref> and was accompanied by the [[sakara drum|sakara]], a tambourine-drum, and Hawaiian guitar. Among the genre's earliest stars were [[Haruna Ishola]] and Ayinla Omowura; Ishola released numerous hits from the late '50s to the early '80s, becoming one of the country's most famous performers. Fuji grew steadily more popular between the 1960s and '70s, becoming closely associated with [[Islam]] in the process.\n\nFuji has been described as j\u00f9j\u00fa without guitars; ironically, Ebenezer Obey once described j\u00f9j\u00fa as [[mambo (music)|mambo]] with guitars.<ref>Graham, pg. 593 Graham does not cite a specific source beyond Ebenezer Obey, and explains that fuji is only ''sometimes glibly described as j\u00f9j\u00fa music without guitars''</ref> However, at its roots, fuji is a mixture of [[Muslim]] traditional [[were music]]'[[ajisari]] songs with \"aspects of [[apala]] percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical sakara music\";<ref>Afropop: Fuji '' [[Ayinde Barrister]], who remains on the leading edge, started out in 1965 singing [[were music]] used to rouse [[Muslims]] early in the morning during the holy season of [[Ramadan]]. He went on to mix in aspects of apala percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical [[sakara music]] and emerged with a new style of music he dubbed [[fuji music|fuji]].''</ref> of these elements, ''apala'' is the fundamental basis of fuji<ref>Afropop: Apala Afropop cites this claim as ''typically considered the most important precursor'' of fuji</ref> The first stars of fuji were the rival bandleaders Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and [[Ayinla Kollington]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/8/Fuji/ |title=Afropop Fuji |publisher=Afropop.org |accessdate=2010-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073531/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/8/Fuji/ |archivedate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> Alhaji Sikiru [[Ayinde Barrister]] started his fuji career in the early 1970s with the ''Golden Fuji Group\", although he had sung Muslim songs since he was 10 years old. He first changed his group's name to \"Fuji Londoners\" when he came back from a trip to London, England. After a very long time &mdash; with hits such as \"Orilonise\", Fuji Disco/Iku Baba Obey\", \"Oke Agba\", \"Aye\", and \"Suuru\" &mdash; he later changed the group's name to \"Supreme Fuji Commanders\" with a bang!, \"Orelope\" that went platinum instantly. Ayinde's rival was [[Ayinla Kollington]], \"Baba Alatika\", known for fast tempo and dance-able brand of fuji, who also recorded hit albums like \"ko bo simi lo'run mo e, in the 80s he released \"ijo yoyo, Lakukulala and American megastar\" to mention few of his successful albums. With all due respect Ayinla Kollington is a coherent social commentator. He was followed in the 1980s by burgeoning stars such as'' [[Wasiu Ayinde Marshall]]''.''\n\n==== Sunny Ade and Obey ====\n[[Ebenezer Obey]] formed the ''International Brothers'' in 1964, and his band soon rivalled that of IK Dairo as the biggest Nigerian group. They played a form of [[blues]]y, guitar-based and highlife-influenced j\u00f9j\u00fa that included complex [[talking drum]]-dominated percussion elements. Obey's lyrics addressed issues that appealed to urban listeners, and incorporated Yoruba traditions and his conservative Christian faith. His rival was [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], who emerged in the same period, forming the ''Green Spots'' in 1966 and then achieving some major hits with the ''African Beats'' after 1974's ''[[Esu Biri Ebo Mi]]''. Ade and Obey raced to incorporate new influences into j\u00f9j\u00fa music and to gather new fans; [[Hawaiian slack-key]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and background vocals were among the innovations added during this rapidly changing period.<ref>Graham, pgs. 591\u2013592 Graham discusses at length the rivalry between Ade and Obey that spurred so much innovation</ref> Ade added strong elements of Jamaican [[dub music]], and introduced the practice of having the guitar play the rhythm and the drums play the melody. During this period, j\u00f9j\u00fa songs changed from short pop songs to long tracks, often over 20 minutes in length. Bands increased from four performers in the original ensembles, to 10 with IK Dairo and more than 30 with Obey and Ade.\n\n=== 1980s and '90s ===\nIn the early 1980s, both Obey and Ade found larger audiences outside of Nigeria. In 1982, Ade was signed to [[Island Records]], who hoped to replicate [[Bob Marley]]'s success, and released ''[[Juju Music (album)|Juju Music]]'', which sold far beyond expectations in Europe and the United States.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Obey released ''Current Affairs'' in 1980 on [[Virgin Records]] and became a brief star in the UK, but was not able to sustain his international career as long as Ade. Ade led a brief period of international fame for j\u00f9j\u00fa, which ended in 1985 when he lost his record contract after the commercial failure of ''[[Aura (King Sunny Ad\u00e9 album)|Aura]]'' (recorded with [[Stevie Wonder]]) and his band walked out in the middle of a huge Japanese tour. Ade's brush with international renown brought a lot of attention from mainstream record companies, and helped to inspire the burgeoning [[world music]] industry. By the end of the 1980s, j\u00f9j\u00fa had lost out to other styles, like [[Yo-pop]], [[Nigerian gospel|gospel]] and [[reggae]]. In the 1990s, however, fuji and j\u00f9j\u00fa remained popular, as did [[waka music]] and Nigerian reggae. At the very end of the decade, [[hip hop music]] spread to the country after being a major part of music in neighboring regions like Senegal.\n\n==== Yo-pop and Afro-j\u00f9j\u00fa (1980s) ====\n{{Main|Yo-pop|Afro-juju}}\n\nTwo of the biggest stars of the '80s were [[Segun Adewale]] and [[Shina Peters]], who started their careers performing in the mid-'70s with [[Prince Adekunle]]. They eventually left Adekunle and formed a brief partnership as ''Shina Adewale & the International Superstars'' before beginning solo careers.<ref name=\"afropop.org\"/> Adewale was the first of the two to gain success, when he became the most famous performer of [[Yo-pop]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\nThe Yo-pop craze did not last for long, replaced by Shina Peters' Afro-juju style, which broke into the mainstream after the release of ''[[Afro-Juju Series 1]]'' (1989). Afro-juju was a combination of Afrobeat and fuji, and it ignited such fervor among Shina's fans that the phenomenon was dubbed \"Shinamania\". Though he was awarded [[Juju Musician of the Year]] in 1990, Shina's follow-up, ''[[Shinamania]]'' sold respectively but was panned by critics.<ref>Graham, pgs. 592\u2013593 Graham describes the origins of Peters' Afro-juju, the importance of ''Afro-Juju Series 1'', the term ''Shinamania'' and the critical and commercial performance of ''Shinamania''</ref> His success opened up the field to newcomers, however, leading to the success of [[Fabulous Olu Fajemirokun]] and [[Adewale Ayuba]]. The same period saw the rise of new styles like the ''[[funky juju]]'' pioneered by [[Dele Taiwo]].<ref>Afropop: Juju Afropop refers to the time period for ''funky juju'' as around the same time as 1989 or 1990</ref>\n\n==== Afrobeat ====\n{{Main|Afrobeat}}\n[[File:FemiKuti.jpg|thumb|left|[[Femi Kuti]]]]\nAfrobeat is a style most closely associated with Nigeria, though practitioners and fans are found throughout West Africa, and Afrobeat recordings are a prominent part of the [[world music]] category found throughout the developed world. It is music with elements of highlife, and other styles of West African music. The most popular and well-known performer, indeed the most famous Nigerian musician in history, is undoubtedly [[Fela Kuti]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\nFela Kuti began performing in 1961, but did not start playing in his distinctive Afrobeat style until his exposure to Sierra Leonean Afro-soul singer [[Geraldo Pino]] in 1963.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Although Kuti is often credited as the only pioneer of Afrobeat, other musicians such as Orlando Julius Ekemode were also prominent in the early Afrobeat scene, where they combined highlife, jazz and funk. A brief period in the United States saw him exposed to the [[Black Power]] movement and the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], an influence that he would come to express in his lyrics. After living in London briefly, he moved back to Lagos and opened a club, The Shrine, which was one of the most popular music spots in the city. He started recording with [[Fela Kuti|Africa '70]], a huge band featuring drummer [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]], who has since gone on to become a well-known musician in his own right. With Africa 70, Kuti recorded a series of hits, earning the ire of the government as he tackled such diverse issues as poverty, traffic and skin-bleaching. In 1985, Kuti was jailed for five years, but was released after only two years after international outcry and massive domestic protests. Upon release, Kuti continued to criticise the government in his songs, and became known for eccentric behaviour, such as suddenly divorcing all twenty-eight wives because \"no man has the right to own a woman's vagina\". His death from [[AIDS]] in 1997 sparked a period of national mourning that was unprecedented in documented Nigerian history.<ref>Graham, pg. 595 Graham is the source for the \"vagina\" quote, as well as the details of Kuti's career and the significance of his death</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Afrobeat became affiliated with the burgeoning genre of [[world music]]. In Europe and North America, so-called \"world music\" acts came from all over the world and played in a multitude of styles. Fela Kuti and his Afrobeat followers were among the most famous of the musicians considered world music.\n\nBy the end of the '80s and early '90s, Afrobeat had diversified by taking in new influences from [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]]. The ever-masked and enigmatic [[Lagbaja|L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1]] became one of the standard-bearers of the new wave of Afrobeat, especially after his 1996 LP ''[[C'est Une African Thing]]''. Following a surprise appearance in place of his father, Fela, [[Femi Kuti]] garnered a large fan base that enabled him to tour across Europe.\n\nSee Also\n*[https://simpletune.org - Download latest Musics & News worldwide]\n\n==== Waka ====\n{{Main|Waka music}}\n\nThe popular songstress [[Salawa Abeni]] had become nationally renowned after the release of ''[[Late General Murtala Ramat Mohammed]]'' in 1976, which was the first Nigerian recording by a woman to sell more than a million copies. In the 1980s, she remained one of the nation's best-selling artists, creating her own unique variety of music called waka; she was so closely associated with the genre that a royal figure, the [[List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo|Alaafin of Oyo]], [[Obalamidi Adeyemi]], crowned her the \"Queen of Waka Music\" in 1992. Waka was a fusion of j\u00f9j\u00fa, fuji and traditional Yoruba music.Waka music is coming back into the new age with fresh artist like Tila man Timi Korus and Dollar billz bringing back the old school into new school.In an interview granted by Timi Korus he acknowledge that Waka Music was made popular to younger generations during the time of salawa abeni but waka music has been in the industry in a long time.\n\n==== Reggae and hip hop ====\n{{Main|Nigerian reggae|Nigerian gospel|Nigerian hip hop}}\n[[File:Duncan Mighty.jpg|right|thumb|Duncan Mighty performing]]\n*[https://simpletune.org - Download latest Musics & News worldwide]\nWhen talking about reggae music in Nigeria, this brand of music was started by a musician simply called \"Terakota\". By the 80s, Nigerian reggae stars included [[The Mandators]], Ras Kimono, [[Majek Fashek]], whose 1988 [[cover version|cover]] of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[Redemption Song]]\", became an unprecedented success for reggae in Nigeria. Like many later Nigerian reggae stars, Fashek was a part of the long-running band The Mandators, who toured and recorded incessantly during the mid to late 1980s and early '90s. Later prominent reggae musicians included [[Jerri Jheto]] and [[Daddy Showkey]].\n\nThe African Caribbean fusion is one that has been popular and growing over the years, especially in the 21st century. In this genre of music African musicians incorporate [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican patois]] into their lyrics and beats. Although, very popular in Jamaica, this genre well blended genre became well known in the African region around the 19th century because of the Nigerian Reggae musician Majek Fashek who attracted international attention to this fusion.<ref>Majek Fashek | Biography | AllMusic. (n.d.). AllMusic. Retrieved October 13, 2014, from http://www.allmusic.com/artist/majek-fashek-mn0000236645/biography</ref> This genre of music is gaining far more presence in Nigeria with recent 21st century artists like [[Duncan Mighty]], [[Timaya]], Slim Burna, [[Orezi]], [[Burna Boy]] and [[Patoranking]] who are attracting a younger audience.\n\n[[Hip hop music]] was brought to Nigeria in the late 1980s, and grew steadily popular throughout the first part of the 1990s. The first acts included [[Sound on Sound]], Emphasis, [[Ruff Rugged & Raw]], [[SWAT ROOT]], [[De Weez]] and [[Black Masquradaz]]. Moreover, mainstream success grew later in the decade, with attention brought by early hits like [[The Trybesmen]]'s \"Trybal Marks\" (1999) and the trio [[The Remedies]]' \"Judile\" and \"Sakoma\". One of The Remedies, [[Tony Tetuila]], went on to work with the [[Plantashun Boiz]] to great commercial acclaim. The 1999 founding of [[Paybacktyme Records]] by [[Solomon Dare]], popularly known as [[Solodee]], [[Kennis Music]] by Kenny Ogungbe, [[Dove Records]] by Nelson Brown, and [[Trybe Records]] by [[eLDee]] helped redefined and establish a Nigerian hip hop scene. Also, the general rapid growth of the entertainment scene with support from the media helped popularise Hiphop music in Nigeria. Television Programmes like Videowheels, [[HipTV]], Music Africa, the MTN Y'ello show, Music Africa, Nigezie, and Soundcity played a major role. Other prominent Nigerian hip-hop musicians include [[Ruggedman]], [[Eedris Abdulkareem]], [[Weird MC]], [[Naeto C]], [[Twin-X]], and [[P-Square]] \n\nAround the close of the decade of the 2000s, more hip-hop acts began to gain popularity. Notable hip hop acts in this era include [[Olamide]], [[Vector (artiste)|Vector]], [[Reminisce (musician)|Reminisce]], [[Ice Prince]] and [[M.I Abaga]]. Some upcoming acts such as [[Kiss Daniel]], [[Tekno (musician)|Tekno]], [[Mc Galaxy]], [[Adekunle Gold]], [[Dammy Krane]], [[Erigga]], and [[Lil Kesh ]] have also started to receive more attention for their songs.\n\n== Women in music ==\n\nIn the Nigerian music industry the female artists stand out and are widely recognized for their talents and achievements. Over the years most Nigerian female artists stuck to the contemporary African music, but in the 21st century several female artists began to diversify into other genres like Rap, Hip-hop and [[Afrobeats]]. Notable female Nigerian rappers include [[Weird MC|Weird Mc]], [[Sasha P|Sasha P]], [[Mo'Cheddah|Mo'Cheddah]] and [[Eva Alordiah]]. While in terms of Afrobeats there are so many female artists but only a few have been constant over the years like [[Omawumi Megbele]], [[Yinka Davies]], [[Goldie]], [[Seyi Shay|Seyi Shay]], [[Niniola]], [[Tiwa Savage]], [[Yemi Alade]] and [[Simi]].<ref>[http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/11/top-7-queens-of-the-nigerian-music-industry/ \"Top 7 queens of the Nigerian music industry\"].

Although the principal attraction of the durbar festivals is displays of traditional [[horsemanship]], performances by drummers, trumpeters and praise-singers are an important part of the celebration&nbsp;Africa Travel. Other holidays in which music plays an important role include [[drums|drumming]] and dances performed at [[Christmas]], [[Easter Sunday]] and [[Easter Monday]]. 9ice is also one of the upcoming artiste (he sings both Yoruba and English pop) gongoaso is one of his top single.\n\n== Classical music ==\nIn the 20th century, Nigeria produced a number of classical composers; these include [[Lazarus Ekwueme]], [[Fela Sowande]], [[Joshua Uzoigwe]], [[Ayo Bankole]], and [[Akin Euba]]. Sowande was one of the first and most famous African composers in the Western classical tradition, and founder of the [[Nigerian art music]] tradition. Sowande was also an [[organ (musical instrument)|organist]] and [[jazz]] musician,  incorporating these and elements of Nigerian folk music into his work. [[Echezonachukwu Nduka]] is poet and pianist, specializing in piano music by African and African-descent composers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Country music in Nigeria]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.africa-ata.org/nigeria_3.htm|title=Nigeria: Festivals and Cultural Tours|work=Africa Travel Magazine|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.africanchorus.org/Voam/Voam624.htm|title=The Orchestra in the African Context|work=African Chorus|accessdate=June 21, 2005}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://chevalierdesaintgeorges.homestead.com/Sowande.html|title=Fela Sowande: Nigerian Composer, Organist & Professor|work=Africlassical.com|accessdate=August 23, 2005}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/5/Nigeria/|title=Afropop Nigeria|work=Afropop|accessdate=June 21, 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616034252/http://afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/5/Nigeria/|archivedate=June 16, 2010}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/18/Juju/|title=Afropop Juju|work=Afropop|accessdate=June 21, 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073525/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/18/Juju/|archivedate=June 25, 2008}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/8/Fuji/|title=Afropop Fuji|work=Afropop|accessdate=June 21, 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073531/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/8/Fuji/|archivedate=June 25, 2008}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/45/Apala/|title=Afropop Apala|work=Afropop|accessdate=June 21, 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229200541/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/45/Apala/|archivedate=February 29, 2012}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.arab-world-information.com/islam.htm|title=Islam|work=Arab World Information|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}, specifically the sections \"Fuji Music of Nigeria\" and \"Traditional Hausa Music of Nigeria\"\n* {{RoughGuide|author=Graham, Ronnie|title=From Hausa Music to Highlife}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/English/ArtCulture/2004/05/article07.shtml|title=A Glimpse at Nigeria|work=IslamOnline|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}\n* {{cite book|author=[[Otto Karolyi|Karolyi, Otto]]|title=Traditional African & Oriental Music|url=https://archive.org/details/traditionalafric0000karo|url-access=registration|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-14-023107-2 }}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.motherlandnigeria.com/holidays.html|title=Holidays|work=Motherland Nigeria|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}\n*{{cite book|author=Omojola, Bode|title=Nigerian Art Music|publisher=University of Ibadan|year=1995|isbn=978-2015-38-5}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/features/celebrityfashion/2005/may/21/celebrityfashion-21-05-2005-001.htm|title=ADDICTED!

Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of [[Demographics of Nigeria#Ethnic groups|ethnic groups]] in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. Little is known about the country's music history prior to European contact, although [[bronze]] carvings dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries have been found depicting musicians and their instruments.<ref>Karolyi, pg. 4</ref> The largest ethnic groups are the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. Traditional music from Nigeria and throughout Africa is almost always functional; in other words, it is performed to mark a ritual such as a [[wedding]] or [[funeral]] and not to achieve artistic goals.<ref>Titon. P. 70</ref> Although some Nigerians, especially children and the elderly, play instruments for their own amusement, solo performance is otherwise rare. Music is closely linked to [[agriculture]], and there are restrictions on, for example, which instruments can be played during different parts of the growing season.\n\n[[Work song]]s are a common type of traditional Nigerian music. They help to keep the rhythm of workers in fields, river canoes and other fields. Women use complex rhythms in housekeeping tasks, such as pounding [[yam (vegetable)|yams]] to highly ornamented music. In the northern regions, farmers work together on each other's farms and the host is expected to supply musicians for his neighbours.\n\nThe issue of musical composition is also highly variable. The [[Hwana]], for example, believe that all songs are taught by the peoples' ancestors, while the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] give credit to named composers for almost all songs, and the [[Efik people|Efik]] name individual composers only for secular songs. In many parts of Nigeria, musicians are allowed to say things in their lyrics that would otherwise be perceived as offensive. <!-- examples? -->\n\nThe most common format for music in Nigeria is the [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] choir, in which a lead singer and a chorus interchange verses, sometimes accompanied by instruments that either shadow the lead text or repeat and [[ostinato]] vocal phrase. The southern area features complex rhythms and solo players using melody instruments, while the north more typically features polyphonic wind ensembles. The extreme north region is associated with [[monody|monodic]] (i.e., single-line) music with an emphasis on drums, and tends to be more influenced by [[Islamic music]].\n\n==Traditional music==\n=== Hausa ===\n\n{{Main|Hausa music}}\n\nThe people of the North are known for complex percussion instrument music, the one-stringed [[goje]], and a strong praise song vocal tradition. Under Muslim influence since the 14th century, Hausa music uses free-rhythmic improvisation and the [[Pentatonic scale]], similar to other Muslim [[Sahelian]] tribes throughout West Africa, such as the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Fulani]] and [[Songhai people|Songhai]]. Traditional Hausa music is used to celebrate births, marriages, circumcisions, and other important life events. Hausa ceremonial music is well known in the area and is dominated by families of praise singers. The Hausa play percussion instruments such as the [[tambura drum]] and the [[talking drum]]. The most impressive of the Hausa state instruments, however, is the elongated state trumpet called [[Kakaki]], which was originally used by the [[Songhai people|Songhai]] cavalry and was taken by the rising Hausa states as a symbol of military power. Kakaki trumpets can be more than two metres long, and can be easily broken down into three portable parts for easy transportation.\n\n=== Igbo ===\n\n{{Main|Igbo music}}\n\nThe [[Igbo people]] live in the south-east of Nigeria, and play a wide variety of folk instruments. They are known for their ready adoption of foreign styles, and were an important part of Nigerian highlife.<ref>Graham, pg. 589 Graham describes both the receptivity of the Igbo to foreign influences, as well as the use of the ''obo''</ref> The most widespread instrument is the 13-stringed [[zither]], called an ''[[obo]]''. The Igbo also play [[slit drum]]s, [[xylophone]]s, [[flute]]s, [[lyre]]s, [[udu]]s and lutes, and more recently, imported European [[brass instrument]]s.\n\nCourtly music is played among the more traditional Igbo, maintaining their royal traditions. The ''ufie'' ([[slit drum]]) is used to wake the chief and communicate meal times and other important information to him. Bell and drum ensembles are used to announce when the chief departs and returns to his village. Meal times may include pie, and other dessert foods for the holidays.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham</ref>\n\n=== Yoruba ===\n\n{{Main|Yoruba music}} \n\nThe [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] have a [[drum]]ming tradition, with a characteristic use of the [[Talking drum|dundun]] hourglass [[tension drums]]. Ensembles using the dundun play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.<ref name=\"africanchorus.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.africanchorus.org/Voam/Voam624.htm |title=The Orchestra in the African Context |publisher=Africanchorus.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> These ensembles consist of various sizes of tension drums, along with kettledrums (''gudugudu''). The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''iyalu'', who uses the drum to \"talk\" by imitating the tonality of [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Much of Yoruba music is spiritual in nature, and is devoted to their God.\n\nYoruba music has become the most important component of modern Nigerian popular music, as a result of its early influence from European, Islamic and Brazilian forms. These influences stemmed from the importation of [[brass instrument]]s, [[sheet music]], Islamic percussion and styles brought by Brazilian merchants.<ref>Graham, pg. 589 Graham claims the source of the Brazilian influence was the ''influential Brazilian merchant community of the early 19th century.''</ref> In both the Nigeria's most populous city, [[Lagos]], and the largest city of [[Ibadan]], these multicultural traditions were brought together and became the root of Nigerian popular music. Modern styles such as [[Ayinde Barrister]]'s [[fuji music|fuji]], [[Salawa Abeni]]'s [[waka music|waka]] and [[Yusuf Olatunji]]'s [[sakara music|sakara]] are derived primarily from Yoruba traditional music.Yoruba music have now come of age and the new generation of Nigerian music now sing in their native language. 9ice is one of many that broke into the industry with Gongo Aso and many more artist followed. Listening to [[Timi Korus]] Babe mi Jowo and Flosha denotes artist home and abroad now rap and sing in yoruba and not forgetting their heritage.\n\n== Theatrical music ==\n\nNigerian theatre makes extensive use of music. Often, this is simply traditional music used in a theatrical production without adaptation. However, there are also distinct styles of music used in Nigerian [[opera]]. Here, music is used to convey an impression of the dramatic action to the audience. Music is also used in literary drama, although its musical accompaniment is more sparingly used than in opera; again, music communicates the mood or tone of events to the audience. An example is [[John Pepper Clark]]'s ''[[The Ozidi Saga]]'', a play about murder and revenge, featuring both human and non-human actors. Each character in the play is associated with a personal theme song, which accompanies battles in which the character is involved.\n\nTraditional Nigerian theatre includes [[puppetry|puppet]] shows in [[Borno State]] and among the Ogoni and Tiv, and the ancient Yoruba [[Al\u00e1\u00e0r\u00ecnj\u00f3]] tradition, which may be descended from the [[Eg\u00fang\u00fan]] masquerade. With the influx of road-building colonial powers, these theatre groups spread across the country and their productions grew ever more elaborate. They now typically use European instruments, film extracts and recorded music.\n\nIn the past, both [[Hubert Ogunde]] and [[Ade Love]], of blessed memories, produced soundtracks of their movies using very rich [[Yoruba language]]. Modern day Yoruba film and theater music composers among whom [[Tope Alabi]] is the flagbearer have variously accompanied dramatic actions with original music.\n\n== Children's music ==\n\nChildren in Nigeria have many of their own traditions, usually singing [[game]]s. These are most often call-and-response type songs, using archaic language. There are other songs, such as among the [[Tarok]] people that are sexually explicit and obscene, and are only performed far away from the home. Children also use instruments like [[untuned percussion|un-pitched]] [[raft zither]]s (made from cornstalks) and [[drum kit|drums]] made from tin cans, a pipe made from a [[papaya|pawpaw]] stem and a [[jaw harp]] made from a [[sorghum]] stalk. Among the Hausa, children play a unique instrument in which they beat rhythms on the inflated stomach of a live, irritated [[pufferfish]].\n\n== Traditional instruments ==\n\nAlthough percussion instruments are omnipresent, Nigeria's traditional music uses a number of diverse instruments. Many, such as the [[xylophone]], are an integral part of music across West Africa, while others are imports from the Muslims of the [[Maghreb]], or from Southern or East Africa; other instruments have arrived from Europe or the Americas. Brass instruments and woodwinds were early imports that played a vital role in the development of Nigerian music, while the later importation of electric guitars spurred the popularisation of j\u00f9j\u00fa music.\n\n=== Percussion ===\n\n[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|left|Drummers in [[Ojumo Oro]], [[Kwara State]]]]\nThe xylophone is a tuned [[idiophone]], common throughout west and central Africa. In Nigeria, they are most common in the southern part of the country, and are of the central African model. Several people sometimes simultaneously play a single xylophone. The instruments are usually made of loose wood placed across banana logs. Pit- and box-resonated xylophones are also found. Ensembles of clay pots beaten with a soft pad are common; they are sometimes filled with water. Although normally tuned, untuned examples are sometimes used to produce a bass rhythm. Hollow logs are also used, split lengthways, with resonator holes at the end of the slit. They were traditionally used to communicate over great distances.\n\nVarious bells are a common part of royal regalia, and were used in [[secret society|secret societies]]. They are usually made of iron, or in Islamic orchestras of the north, of bronze. Struck gourds, placed on a cloth and struck with sticks, are a part of women's music, as well as the [[b\u00f2\u00f2r\u00ed\u00ed]] cult dances. Sometimes, especially in the north, gourds are placed upside-down in water, with the pitch adjusted by the amount of air underneath it. In the south-west, a number of tuned gourds are played while floating in a trough.\n\nScrapers are common throughout the south. One of the most common types is a notched stick, played by dragging a shell across the stick at various speeds. It is used both as a women's court instrument and by children in teasing games. Among the Yoruba, an iron rod may be used as a replacement for a stick. Rattles are common, made of gourds containing seeds or stones are common, as are net-rattles, in which a string network of beads or shells encloses a gourd. Rattles are typically played in ritual or religious context, predominantly by women.\n\nDrums of many kinds are the most common type of percussion instrument in Nigeria. They are traditionally made from a single piece of wood or spherical calabashes, but have more recently been made from oil drums. The hourglass drum is the most common shape, although there are also double-headed barrel drums, single-headed drums and conical drums. [[Frame drum]]s are also found in Nigeria, but may be an importation from Brazil. An unusual percussion instrument is the [[udu]], a kind of vessel drum.\nThis instrument is very essential in most African countries.\n\n=== String instruments ===\n\nThe [[musical bow]] is found in Nigeria as a mouth-resonated cord, either plucked or struck. It is most common in the central part of the country, and is associated with agricultural songs and those expressing social concerns. Cereal stalks bound together and strings supported by two bridges are used to make a kind of raft-zither, played with the thumbs, typically for solo entertainment. The arched harp is found in the eastern part of the country, especially among the Tarok. It usually has five or six strings and pentatonic tuning. A bowl-resonated spike-fiddle with a lizard skin table is used in the northern region, and is similar to central Asian and Ethiopian forms. The Hausa and Kanuri peoples play a variety of spike-lutes.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\n\nA variety of [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[woodwind instrument]]s are also found in Nigeria. These include long [[trumpet]]s, frequently made of [[aluminium]] and played in pairs or ensembles of up to six, often accompanied by a [[shawm]]. Wooden trumpets, gourd trumpets, end-blown flutes, cruciform whistles, transverse clarinets and various kinds of horns are also found.\n\n== Popular music ==\nMany African countries have seen turbulence and violence during their forced transition from a diverse region of folk cultures to a group of modern nation states. Nigeria has experienced more difficulty than most African countries in forging a popular cultural identity from the diverse peoples of the countryside.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/5/Nigeria/ |title=Afropop Nigeria |publisher=Afropop.org |accessdate=2010-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616034252/http://afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/5/Nigeria/ |archivedate=2010-06-16 }}</ref> <!-- brief explanation? --> From its beginnings in the streets of Lagos, popular music in Nigeria has long been an integral part of the field of African pop, bringing in influences and instruments from many ethnic groups, most prominently including the Yoruba.\n\nThe earliest styles of Nigerian popular music were [[palm-wine music]] and [[highlife]], which spread in the 1920s among Nigeria and nearby countries of [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Ghana]]. In Nigeria, palm-wine became the primary basis for [[j\u00f9j\u00fa music|j\u00f9j\u00fa]], a genre that dominated popular music for many years. During this time, a few other styles such as [[apala]], derived from traditional Yoruba music, also found a more limited audience. By the 1960s, Cuban, American and other styles of imported music were enjoying a large following, and musicians started to incorporate these influences into j\u00f9j\u00fa. The result was a profusion of new styles in the last few decades of the 20th century, including [[waka music]], [[Yo-pop]] and [[Afrobeat]].\n\n=== Palm-wine and the invention of j\u00f9j\u00fa ===\n{{Main|Palm-wine music}}\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, Yoruba music had incorporated brass instruments, written notation, Islamic percussion and new Brazilian techniques, resulting in the [[Lagos]]-born [[palm-wine music|palm-wine]] style. The term ''palm-wine'' is also used to describe related genres in [[Sierra Leone]], Liberia and [[Ghana]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/> these varieties are better-known than Nigerian palm-wine. However, ''palm-wine'' originally referred to a diverse set of styles played with [[string instrument]]s, characteristically, [[guitar]]s or [[banjo]]s) with [[shaker (percussion)|shakers]] and hand [[drum]]s accompanying<ref name=\"afropop.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/18/Juju/ |title=Afropop Juju |publisher=Afropop.org |accessdate=2010-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073525/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/18/Juju/ |archivedate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> This urban style was frequently played in bars to accompany drinking (hence the name, which is derived from the alcoholic [[palm wine]] beverage).\n\nThe first stars of palm-wine had emerged by the 1920s, the most famous of whom was [[Tunde King|Baba Tunde King]]. King probably coined the word ''j\u00f9j\u00fa'' \u2014 a style of music he helped to create \u2014 in reference to the sound of a Brazilian [[tambourine]]; alternatively, the term may have developed as an expression of disdain by the colonial leaders (any native tradition was apt to be dismissed as 'mere ''joujou'', French for \"nonsense\").<ref>Graham, pg. 590 Graham claims that the word ''juju'' was a ''mild expression of colonial disparagement &mdash; musical mumbo jumbo &mdash; taken up by j\u00f9j\u00fa musicians themselves to subvert it. And ''jojo'' also happens to be Yoruba for ''dance''.''</ref> By the early 1930s, British [[record label]]s such as [[HMV|His Master's Voice]] had started to record palm-wine, and more celebrities emerged, including [[Ojoge Daniel]], [[Tunde Nightingale]] and [[Speedy Araba]]. These artists, along with Tunde King, established the core of the style<ref name=\"afropop.org\"/> which was called [[j\u00f9j\u00fa music|j\u00f9j\u00fa]], and remained one of the most popular genres in Nigeria throughout the 20th century. Some J\u00f9j\u00fa musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the \"blind minstrel\" [[Kokoro (musician)|Kokoro]].<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Culture and customs of Nigeria\n |author=Toyin Falola\n |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group\n |year=2001\n |ISBN=0-313-31338-5\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00falo/page/173 173]\n |url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00falo/page/173\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Apala ===\n{{Main|Apala}}\n\nApala is a style of vocal and percussive Muslim Yoruba music. It emerged in the late 1930s as a means of rousing worshippers after the fasting of [[Ramadan]]. Under the influence of popular [[music of Cuba|Afro-Cuban percussion]], apala developed into a more polished style and attracted a large audience. The music required two or three talking drums (''omele''), a rattle (''sekere''), thumb piano (''agidigbo'') and a bell (''agogo''). [[Haruna Ishola]] was the most famous apala performer, and he later played an integral role in bringing apala to larger audiences as a part of [[fuji music]].<ref>Afropop: Apala Afropop cites this claim as ''(m)usicologist Chris Waterman suggests that the influence of Afro-Cuban percussion recordings was also formative in refining the music's presentation, although not its rhythms and forms''. Afropop further specifies that, though the other instruments mentioned are common throughout Nigerian popular music, the use of the ''agidigbo'' is unusual and peculiar to apala</ref>\n\n=== The 1950s, '60s and '70s ===\nFollowing World War II, Nigerian music started to take on new instruments and techniques, including electric instruments imported from the United States and Europe. [[Rock N' roll]], [[soul music|soul]], and later [[funk]], became very popular in Nigeria, and elements of these genres were added to j\u00f9j\u00fa by artists such as [[I. K. Dairo|IK Dairo]]. Meanwhile, highlife had been slowly gaining in popularity among the Igbo people, and their unique style soon found a national audience. At the same time, [[apala]]'s [[Haruna Ishola]] was becoming one of the country's biggest stars. In the early to mid-1970s, three of the biggest names in Nigerian music history were at their peak: [[Fela Kuti]], [[Ebenezer Obey]] and [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], while the end of that decade saw the start of [[Yo-pop]] and [[Nigerian reggae]].\n\nAlthough popular styles such as highlife and j\u00f9j\u00fa were at the top of the Nigerian charts in the '60s, traditional music remained widespread. Traditional stars included the Hausa [[Dan Maraya]], who was so well known that he was brought to the battlefield during the 1967 [[Nigerian Civil War]] to lift the morale of the federal troops.\n\n==== Modernisation of J\u00f9j\u00fa ====\n{{Main|J\u00f9j\u00fa music}}\n[[File:IKDairo.png|thumb|I.K. Dairo]]\n\nFollowing World War II, [[Tunde Nightingale]]'s [[s'o wa mbe]] style made him one of the first j\u00f9j\u00fa stars, and he introduced more Westernised pop influences to the genre. During the 1950s, recording technology grew more advanced, and the gangan [[talking drum]], [[electric guitar]] and [[accordion]] were incorporated into j\u00f9j\u00fa. Much of this innovation was the work of [[IK Dairo & the Morning Star Orchestra]] (later ''IK Dairo & the Blue Spots''), which formed in 1957.<ref name=\"afropop.org\"/> these performers brought j\u00f9j\u00fa from the rural poor to the urban cities of Nigeria and beyond. Dairo became perhaps the biggest star of African music by the '60s, recording numerous hit songs that spread his fame to as far away as Japan. In 1963, he became the only African musician ever honoured by receiving membership of the [[Order of the British Empire]], an [[order of chivalry]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n==== Dispersion of highlife ====\n{{Main|Highlife}}\n\nAmong the Igbo people, Ghanaian [[highlife]] became popular in the early 1950s, and other guitar-band styles from [[Cameroon]] and [[Zaire]] soon followed. The Ghanaian [[E. T. Mensah]], easily the most popular highlife performer of the 1950s, toured Igbo-land frequently, drawing huge crowds of devoted fans. [[Bobby Benson]] & His Combo was the first Nigerian highlife band to find audiences across the country. Benson was followed by [[Jim Lawson & the Mayor's Dance Band]], who achieved national fame in the mid-'70s, ending with Lawson's death in 1971. During the same period, other highlife performers were reaching their peak. These included [[Prince Nico Mbarga]] and his band Rocafil Jazz, whose \"[[Sweet Mother]]\" was a pan-African hit that sold more than 13 million copies, more than any other African single of any kind. Mbarga used English lyrics in a style that he dubbed [[panko]], which incorporated \"sophisticated [[African Rumba|rumba]] guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom\".<ref>Graham, pgs. 596\u2013597 Graham explains the importance of both Benson and Lawson. Referring to \"Sweet Mother, Graham explains: ''(b)ut it is an infectious song and its potent appeal was concocted from Mbarga's use of pidgin English (broadening his audience enormously) and a style he called ''panko'' &mdash; for the first time incorporating sophisticated rumba guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom.''</ref>\n\nAfter the civil war in the 1960s, Igbo musicians were forced out of Lagos and returned to their homeland. The result was that highlife ceased to be a major part of mainstream Nigerian music, and was thought of as being something purely associated with the Igbos of the east. Highlife's popularity slowly dwindled among the Igbos, supplanted by j\u00f9j\u00fa and fuji. However, a few performers kept the style alive, such as Yoruba singer and trumpeter [[Victor Olaiya]] (the only Nigerian to ever earn a platinum record), [[Stephen Osita Osadebe]], [[Oliver De Coque]], [[Celestine Ukwu]], [[Oriental Brothers]], [[Sonny Okosun]], [[Victor Uwaifo]], and [[Orlando Owoh|Orlando \"Dr. Ganja\" Owoh]], whose distinctive toye style fused j\u00f9j\u00fa and highlife.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n{{listen|filename=PrinceNicoMbargaSweetMother.ogg|title=Prince Nico Mbarga's \"Sweet Mother\"|description=\"Sweet Mother\" was a best-selling single across Africa}}\n\n==== Birth of fuji ====\n{{Main|Fuji music}}\n\n[[Apala]], a traditional style from Ogun state, one of yoruba state in Nigeria, became very popular in the 1960s, led by performers like [[Haruna Ishola]], Sefiu Ayan, Kasumu Adio, and Ayinla Omowura. Ishola, who was one of Nigeria's most consistent hit makers between 1955 and his death in 1983, recorded apala songs, which alternated between slow and emotional, and swift and energetic. His lyrics were a mixture of improvised praise and passages from the [[Quran]], as well as traditional [[proverb]]s. His work became a formative influence on the developing fuji style.\n\nThe late 1960s saw the appearance of the first fuji bands. Fuji was named after [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan, purely for the sound of the word, according to [[Ayinde Barrister]].<ref>Graham, pg. 593 Graham does not cite a specific source for the claim by Sikiru Barrister</ref> Fuji was a synthesis of apala with the \"ornamented, free-rhythmic\" vocals of ''[[ajisari]]'' devotional musicians<ref>Arab World Information, \"Popular Fuji Music of Nigeria\"</ref> and was accompanied by the [[sakara drum|sakara]], a tambourine-drum, and Hawaiian guitar. Among the genre's earliest stars were [[Haruna Ishola]] and Ayinla Omowura; Ishola released numerous hits from the late '50s to the early '80s, becoming one of the country's most famous performers. Fuji grew steadily more popular between the 1960s and '70s, becoming closely associated with [[Islam]] in the process.\n\nFuji has been described as j\u00f9j\u00fa without guitars; ironically, Ebenezer Obey once described j\u00f9j\u00fa as [[mambo (music)|mambo]] with guitars.<ref>Graham, pg. 593 Graham does not cite a specific source beyond Ebenezer Obey, and explains that fuji is only ''sometimes glibly described as j\u00f9j\u00fa music without guitars''</ref> However, at its roots, fuji is a mixture of [[Muslim]] traditional [[were music]]'[[ajisari]] songs with \"aspects of [[apala]] percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical sakara music\";<ref>Afropop: Fuji '' [[Ayinde Barrister]], who remains on the leading edge, started out in 1965 singing [[were music]] used to rouse [[Muslims]] early in the morning during the holy season of [[Ramadan]]. He went on to mix in aspects of apala percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical [[sakara music]] and emerged with a new style of music he dubbed [[fuji music|fuji]].''</ref> of these elements, ''apala'' is the fundamental basis of fuji<ref>Afropop: Apala Afropop cites this claim as ''typically considered the most important precursor'' of fuji</ref> The first stars of fuji were the rival bandleaders Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and [[Ayinla Kollington]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/8/Fuji/ |title=Afropop Fuji |publisher=Afropop.org |accessdate=2010-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073531/http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/8/Fuji/ |archivedate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> Alhaji Sikiru [[Ayinde Barrister]] started his fuji career in the early 1970s with the ''Golden Fuji Group\", although he had sung Muslim songs since he was 10 years old. He first changed his group's name to \"Fuji Londoners\" when he came back from a trip to London, England. After a very long time &mdash; with hits such as \"Orilonise\", Fuji Disco/Iku Baba Obey\", \"Oke Agba\", \"Aye\", and \"Suuru\" &mdash; he later changed the group's name to \"Supreme Fuji Commanders\" with a bang!, \"Orelope\" that went platinum instantly. Ayinde's rival was [[Ayinla Kollington]], \"Baba Alatika\", known for fast tempo and dance-able brand of fuji, who also recorded hit albums like \"ko bo simi lo'run mo e, in the 80s he released \"ijo yoyo, Lakukulala and American megastar\" to mention few of his successful albums. With all due respect Ayinla Kollington is a coherent social commentator. He was followed in the 1980s by burgeoning stars such as'' [[Wasiu Ayinde Marshall]]''.''\n\n==== Sunny Ade and Obey ====\n[[Ebenezer Obey]] formed the ''International Brothers'' in 1964, and his band soon rivalled that of IK Dairo as the biggest Nigerian group. They played a form of [[blues]]y, guitar-based and highlife-influenced j\u00f9j\u00fa that included complex [[talking drum]]-dominated percussion elements. Obey's lyrics addressed issues that appealed to urban listeners, and incorporated Yoruba traditions and his conservative Christian faith. His rival was [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], who emerged in the same period, forming the ''Green Spots'' in 1966 and then achieving some major hits with the ''African Beats'' after 1974's ''[[Esu Biri Ebo Mi]]''. Ade and Obey raced to incorporate new influences into j\u00f9j\u00fa music and to gather new fans; [[Hawaiian slack-key]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and background vocals were among the innovations added during this rapidly changing period.<ref>Graham, pgs. 591\u2013592 Graham discusses at length the rivalry between Ade and Obey that spurred so much innovation</ref> Ade added strong elements of Jamaican [[dub music]], and introduced the practice of having the guitar play the rhythm and the drums play the melody. During this period, j\u00f9j\u00fa songs changed from short pop songs to long tracks, often over 20 minutes in length. Bands increased from four performers in the original ensembles, to 10 with IK Dairo and more than 30 with Obey and Ade.\n\n=== 1980s and '90s ===\nIn the early 1980s, both Obey and Ade found larger audiences outside of Nigeria. In 1982, Ade was signed to [[Island Records]], who hoped to replicate [[Bob Marley]]'s success, and released ''[[Juju Music (album)|Juju Music]]'', which sold far beyond expectations in Europe and the United States.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Obey released ''Current Affairs'' in 1980 on [[Virgin Records]] and became a brief star in the UK, but was not able to sustain his international career as long as Ade. Ade led a brief period of international fame for j\u00f9j\u00fa, which ended in 1985 when he lost his record contract after the commercial failure of ''[[Aura (King Sunny Ad\u00e9 album)|Aura]]'' (recorded with [[Stevie Wonder]]) and his band walked out in the middle of a huge Japanese tour. Ade's brush with international renown brought a lot of attention from mainstream record companies, and helped to inspire the burgeoning [[world music]] industry. By the end of the 1980s, j\u00f9j\u00fa had lost out to other styles, like [[Yo-pop]], [[Nigerian gospel|gospel]] and [[reggae]]. In the 1990s, however, fuji and j\u00f9j\u00fa remained popular, as did [[waka music]] and Nigerian reggae. At the very end of the decade, [[hip hop music]] spread to the country after being a major part of music in neighboring regions like Senegal.\n\n==== Yo-pop and Afro-j\u00f9j\u00fa (1980s) ====\n{{Main|Yo-pop|Afro-juju}}\n\nTwo of the biggest stars of the '80s were [[Segun Adewale]] and [[Shina Peters]], who started their careers performing in the mid-'70s with [[Prince Adekunle]]. They eventually left Adekunle and formed a brief partnership as ''Shina Adewale & the International Superstars'' before beginning solo careers.<ref name=\"afropop.org\"/> Adewale was the first of the two to gain success, when he became the most famous performer of [[Yo-pop]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\nThe Yo-pop craze did not last for long, replaced by Shina Peters' Afro-juju style, which broke into the mainstream after the release of ''[[Afro-Juju Series 1]]'' (1989). Afro-juju was a combination of Afrobeat and fuji, and it ignited such fervor among Shina's fans that the phenomenon was dubbed \"Shinamania\". Though he was awarded [[Juju Musician of the Year]] in 1990, Shina's follow-up, ''[[Shinamania]]'' sold respectively but was panned by critics.<ref>Graham, pgs. 592\u2013593 Graham describes the origins of Peters' Afro-juju, the importance of ''Afro-Juju Series 1'', the term ''Shinamania'' and the critical and commercial performance of ''Shinamania''</ref> His success opened up the field to newcomers, however, leading to the success of [[Fabulous Olu Fajemirokun]] and [[Adewale Ayuba]]. The same period saw the rise of new styles like the ''[[funky juju]]'' pioneered by [[Dele Taiwo]].<ref>Afropop: Juju Afropop refers to the time period for ''funky juju'' as around the same time as 1989 or 1990</ref>\n\n==== Afrobeat ====\n{{Main|Afrobeat}}\n[[File:FemiKuti.jpg|thumb|left|[[Femi Kuti]]]]\nAfrobeat is a style most closely associated with Nigeria, though practitioners and fans are found throughout West Africa, and Afrobeat recordings are a prominent part of the [[world music]] category found throughout the developed world. It is music with elements of highlife, and other styles of West African music. The most popular and well-known performer, indeed the most famous Nigerian musician in history, is undoubtedly [[Fela Kuti]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\nFela Kuti began performing in 1961, but did not start playing in his distinctive Afrobeat style until his exposure to Sierra Leonean Afro-soul singer [[Geraldo Pino]] in 1963.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Although Kuti is often credited as the only pioneer of Afrobeat, other musicians such as Orlando Julius Ekemode were also prominent in the early Afrobeat scene, where they combined highlife, jazz and funk. A brief period in the United States saw him exposed to the [[Black Power]] movement and the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], an influence that he would come to express in his lyrics. After living in London briefly, he moved back to Lagos and opened a club, The Shrine, which was one of the most popular music spots in the city. He started recording with [[Fela Kuti|Africa '70]], a huge band featuring drummer [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]], who has since gone on to become a well-known musician in his own right. With Africa 70, Kuti recorded a series of hits, earning the ire of the government as he tackled such diverse issues as poverty, traffic and skin-bleaching. In 1985, Kuti was jailed for five years, but was released after only two years after international outcry and massive domestic protests. Upon release, Kuti continued to criticise the government in his songs, and became known for eccentric behaviour, such as suddenly divorcing all twenty-eight wives because \"no man has the right to own a woman's vagina\". His death from [[AIDS]] in 1997 sparked a period of national mourning that was unprecedented in documented Nigerian history.<ref>Graham, pg. 595 Graham is the source for the \"vagina\" quote, as well as the details of Kuti's career and the significance of his death</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Afrobeat became affiliated with the burgeoning genre of [[world music]]. In Europe and North America, so-called \"world music\" acts came from all over the world and played in a multitude of styles. Fela Kuti and his Afrobeat followers were among the most famous of the musicians considered world music.\n\nBy the end of the '80s and early '90s, Afrobeat had diversified by taking in new influences from [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]]. The ever-masked and enigmatic [[Lagbaja|L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1]] became one of the standard-bearers of the new wave of Afrobeat, especially after his 1996 LP ''[[C'est Une African Thing]]''. Following a surprise appearance in place of his father, Fela, [[Femi Kuti]] garnered a large fan base that enabled him to tour across Europe.\n\nSee Also\n*[https://simpletune.org - Download latest Musics & News worldwide]\n\n==== Waka ====\n{{Main|Waka music}}\n\nThe popular songstress [[Salawa Abeni]] had become nationally renowned after the release of ''[[Late General Murtala Ramat Mohammed]]'' in 1976, which was the first Nigerian recording by a woman to sell more than a million copies. In the 1980s, she remained one of the nation's best-selling artists, creating her own unique variety of music called waka; she was so closely associated with the genre that a royal figure, the [[List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo|Alaafin of Oyo]], [[Obalamidi Adeyemi]], crowned her the \"Queen of Waka Music\" in 1992. Waka was a fusion of j\u00f9j\u00fa, fuji and traditional Yoruba music.Waka music is coming back into the new age with fresh artist like Tila man Timi Korus and Dollar billz bringing back the old school into new school.In an interview granted by Timi Korus he acknowledge that Waka Music was made popular to younger generations during the time of salawa abeni but waka music has been in the industry in a long time.\n\n==== Reggae and hip hop ====\n{{Main|Nigerian reggae|Nigerian gospel|Nigerian hip hop}}\n[[File:Duncan Mighty.jpg|right|thumb|Duncan Mighty performing]]\n\nWhen talking about reggae music in Nigeria, this brand of music was started by a musician simply called \"Terakota\". By the 80s, Nigerian reggae stars included [[The Mandators]], Ras Kimono, [[Majek Fashek]], whose 1988 [[cover version|cover]] of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[Redemption Song]]\", became an unprecedented success for reggae in Nigeria. Like many later Nigerian reggae stars, Fashek was a part of the long-running band The Mandators, who toured and recorded incessantly during the mid to late 1980s and early '90s. Later prominent reggae musicians included [[Jerri Jheto]] and [[Daddy Showkey]].\n\nThe African Caribbean fusion is one that has been popular and growing over the years, especially in the 21st century. In this genre of music African musicians incorporate [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican patois]] into their lyrics and beats. Although, very popular in Jamaica, this genre well blended genre became well known in the African region around the 19th century because of the Nigerian Reggae musician Majek Fashek who attracted international attention to this fusion.<ref>Majek Fashek | Biography | AllMusic. (n.d.). AllMusic. Retrieved October 13, 2014, from http://www.allmusic.com/artist/majek-fashek-mn0000236645/biography</ref> This genre of music is gaining far more presence in Nigeria with recent 21st century artists like [[Duncan Mighty]], [[Timaya]], Slim Burna, [[Orezi]], [[Burna Boy]] and [[Patoranking]] who are attracting a younger audience.\n\n[[Hip hop music]] was brought to Nigeria in the late 1980s, and grew steadily popular throughout the first part of the 1990s. The first acts included [[Sound on Sound]], Emphasis, [[Ruff Rugged & Raw]], [[SWAT ROOT]], [[De Weez]] and [[Black Masquradaz]]. Moreover, mainstream success grew later in the decade, with attention brought by early hits like [[The Trybesmen]]'s \"Trybal Marks\" (1999) and the trio [[The Remedies]]' \"Judile\" and \"Sakoma\". One of The Remedies, [[Tony Tetuila]], went on to work with the [[Plantashun Boiz]] to great commercial acclaim. The 1999 founding of [[Paybacktyme Records]] by [[Solomon Dare]], popularly known as [[Solodee]], [[Kennis Music]] by Kenny Ogungbe, [[Dove Records]] by Nelson Brown, and [[Trybe Records]] by [[eLDee]] helped redefined and establish a Nigerian hip hop scene. Also, the general rapid growth of the entertainment scene with support from the media helped popularise Hiphop music in Nigeria. Television Programmes like Videowheels, [[HipTV]], Music Africa, the MTN Y'ello show, Music Africa, Nigezie, and Soundcity played a major role. Other prominent Nigerian hip-hop musicians include [[Ruggedman]], [[Eedris Abdulkareem]], [[Weird MC]], [[Naeto C]], [[Twin-X]], and [[P-Square]] \n\nAround the close of the decade of the 2000s, more hip-hop acts began to gain popularity. Notable hip hop acts in this era include [[Olamide]], [[Vector (artiste)|Vector]], [[Reminisce (musician)|Reminisce]], [[Ice Prince]] and [[M.I Abaga]]. Some upcoming acts such as [[Kiss Daniel]], [[Tekno (musician)|Tekno]], [[Mc Galaxy]], [[Adekunle Gold]], [[Dammy Krane]], [[Erigga]], and [[Lil Kesh ]] have also started to receive more attention for their songs.\n\n== Women in music ==\n\nIn the Nigerian music industry the female artists stand out and are widely recognized for their talents and achievements. Over the years most Nigerian female artists stuck to the contemporary African music, but in the 21st century several female artists began to diversify into other genres like Rap, Hip-hop and [[Afrobeats]]. Notable female Nigerian rappers include [[Weird MC|Weird Mc]], [[Sasha P|Sasha P]], [[Mo'Cheddah|Mo'Cheddah]] and [[Eva Alordiah]]. While in terms of Afrobeats there are so many female artists but only a few have been constant over the years like [[Omawumi Megbele]], [[Yinka Davies]], [[Goldie]], [[Seyi Shay|Seyi Shay]], [[Niniola]], [[Tiwa Savage]], [[Yemi Alade]] and [[Simi]].<ref>[http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/11/top-7-queens-of-the-nigerian-music-industry/ \"Top 7 queens of the Nigerian music industry\"].

Although the principal attraction of the durbar festivals is displays of traditional [[horsemanship]], performances by drummers, trumpeters and praise-singers are an important part of the celebration&nbsp;Africa Travel. Other holidays in which music plays an important role include [[drums|drumming]] and dances performed at [[Christmas]], [[Easter Sunday]] and [[Easter Monday]]. 9ice is also one of the upcoming artiste (he sings both Yoruba and English pop) gongoaso is one of his top single.\n\n== Classical music ==\nIn the 20th century, Nigeria produced a number of classical composers; these include [[Lazarus Ekwueme]], [[Fela Sowande]], [[Joshua Uzoigwe]], [[Ayo Bankole]], and [[Akin Euba]]. Sowande was one of the first and most famous African composers in the Western classical tradition, and founder of the [[Nigerian art music]] tradition. Sowande was also an [[organ (musical instrument)|organist]] and [[jazz]] musician,  incorporating these and elements of Nigerian folk music into his work.

==\n[[File:Wembley enggermatch.jpg|thumb|260px|Inside Wembley Stadium]]\n[[File:UAAP cheerdance competition at Araneta Coliseum.JPG|thumb|The annual [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]] routinely sells out the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena.]]\nThis section lists the most recent attendances at annual championship events (single decider matches or the final match in a best-of series only) by total attendance. It also includes domestic leagues and competitions. Additionally, it includes the finals of top-level promotion playoffs, in which teams play to determine potential or confirmed [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to a country's top league level in the next season. It has to be noted that the listed crowd figures are often a reflection of a championship venue's capacity, as demand for these events is generally so high that any stadium or arena would be filled to capacity.\n\nThe method by which championship venue(s) are determined can indirectly affect the attendance of such a match.\n\nIn most competitions that use a best-of final series, each individual match typically takes place at one team's home venue. In the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], a competition in which no team has its own home arena, finals matches (including any that can potentially end a series) are held at three large venues in or near Metro Manila: [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], [[Mall of Asia Arena]] and sometimes [[Philippine Arena]].\n\nIn most competitions that have a one-off final, the site is determined well in advance. Some competitions have a permanent site for their finals. Two notable examples are the [[Australian Football League]], whose [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] is always at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG), and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which holds its final matches in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|Gaelic football]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|hurling]] at [[Croke Park]]. Others determine the final venue anywhere from months to years before the event, such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], which determines the host of the [[Super Bowl]] more than three years in advance.\n\nHowever, one transnational club event in [[rugby union]] (whose final attendance is listed in [[#International club championship final events|a separate table]]) uses a very different system. In [[Super Rugby]], the final is awarded to the finalist that finished higher in the league table during the regular season. Another transnational club event in the same sport, [[Pro14]] (originally the Celtic League), used the same method to determine the host of its final until [[2015 Pro12 Grand Final|2015]], when it began to use a predetermined site.\n\nAs of the 2018 season, all 10 American college sports conferences that sponsor [[College football|football]] in the top-level [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] hold season-ending conference championship games in that sport. Of these leagues, six have a permanent site for their title games and four award hosting rights to the division champion with the better record in conference play (with tiebreakers used as needed).\n\nFor the purposes of this table, \"domestic\" is defined to include leagues which are historically focused in one country, but may have teams in one or more nearby countries. Examples of this phenomenon include:\n* Of the six largest [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|professional leagues in English-speaking North America]], only the two gridiron football leagues\u2014the NFL and CFL\u2014operate on one side of the U.S.\u2013Canada border. Of the four traditional \"major leagues\", only the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] has more than one team in Canada; as of the upcoming {{NHL Year|2019|app=season}}, it has 24 teams in the U.S. and seven in Canada, and will add [[Seattle NHL team|one U.S. team]] for 2021\u201322. [[Major League Soccer]], in recent years becoming increasingly accepted as a fifth \"major league\", currently has 21 U.S. teams and three Canadian teams, and will add four more U.S. teams by 2022.\n* The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which governs Gaelic games, is mostly restricted to the island of Ireland, although teams from [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York City]] participate in its senior championships.\n* Two major Australian leagues\u2014the National Rugby League (rugby league) and A-League (association football)\u2014have included a team from New Zealand since their inception.\n* The vast majority of the teams competing in rugby league's Super League have been from England. Only three teams from outside the country, two from France and one from Wales, have ever competed in the league, and only one of these teams (from France) currently competes at this level.\n* Although the Challenge Cup of rugby league currently includes teams from France, Ireland, Scotland, Serbia, and Wales, and has in the past also had teams from Canada and Russia, the overwhelming majority of the competing teams are from England.\n* The English association football pyramid includes several clubs from Wales, although Welsh clubs do not necessarily participate at every level in a given season. As of the current 2019\u201320 season, no Welsh teams play in the Premier League following the relegation of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], which had played at that level in 2013\u201314 and 2018\u201319. [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] played in the Premier League from 2011\u201312 to 2017\u201318.\n* The Kontinental Hockey League is headquartered in Moscow and is mostly a Russian league, although in its most recent 2018\u201319 season it also had teams in Belarus, China, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Slovakia.\n\nThe [[EuroLeague]] in basketball is transnational in that it includes teams from multiple European countries, but is domestic in the sense of being a championship for the single entity of Europe. It is governed by [[Euroleague Basketball]], an explicitly pan-European body that is independent of the continental governing body of [[FIBA Europe]].\n\nThis contrasts with leagues such as Super Rugby and Pro14, which operate in multiple countries with more than one team in most (Super Rugby) or all (Pro14) of their participating countries, and also make no pretense of being a championship for a continental-size region.\n\n<!--\nNOTICE:\nThis section is meant for games where the championship was won. This includes all games in which the FINAL was a one-game affair. For best-of-x FINALS series, only include the game when the title was won (this inevitably includes all Game 7s in the finals).\n\nDon't add games where the title was not won. This includes any of the first three games in a best-of-7 finals, any game from the semifinals, quarterfinals, any stage in the playoffs, elimination round, regular season, and preseason. Preseason championships may be added. Finals of promotion playoffs may also be added.\n\nDon't add games from past seasons, even if they set records\u2014this is specifically for the MOST RECENT championship for which attendance figures are readily available.\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!Event||Sport||Country||Competition||data-sort-type=\"number\"|Crowd||Year||Venue||City||Ref\n|-\n| [[AFL Grand Final]] || [[Australian rules football]] || Australia || [[Australian Football League]] || {{nts|100014}} || [[2019 AFL Grand Final|2019]] || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] ||[[Melbourne]] ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-09-28/match-report-2019-grand-final-richmond-v-greater-western-sydney |title=Orange crushed: Tigers roar once more under Dimma's dynasty |first=Riley |last=Beveridge |publisher=Australian Football League |date=28 September 2019 |accessdate=30 September 2019 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[FA Cup Final]] || Association football || England || [[FA Cup]] || {{nts|85854}} || [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefa.com/competitions/thefacup/match-stats?season=2018&competition=1&match=1054822 |title=The Emirates FA Cup, Match Stats: Manchester City 6\u20130 Watford |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |date=18 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Championship play-offs|EFL Championship Play-off]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Championship]] || {{nts|85826}} || [[2019 EFL Championship play-off Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London ||<ref name=\"2019 Championship playoff\">{{cite web |url=https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |title=Report: Championship Play-Off Final |publisher=[[English Football League]] |date=27 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527204140/https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |archive-date=27 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Trophy]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Trophy]] || {{nts|85021}} || [[2019 EFL Trophy Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |title=Checkatrade Trophy Final |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 March 2019 |accessdate=2019-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617091347/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |archive-date=17 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n|-\n| [[Big 12 Championship Game]] || [[American football]] || United States || [[Big 12 Conference]] football || {{nts|83114}} || [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|2018]] || [[AT&T Stadium]] || [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] || <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |title=Gamecast: Dr Pepper Big 12 Championship |website=ESPN.com |date=December 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222152322/http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[NRL Grand Final]] || [[Rugby league]] || Australia|| [[National Rugby League]] || {{nts|82688}} || [[2018 NRL Grand Final|2018]] || [[Stadium Australia]] || Sydney ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |title=Match Centre, Telstra Premiership Grand Final |website=National Rugby League |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=22 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001030928/https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]] || [[Hurling]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] || 82,300 || [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2017]] || [[Croke Park]] || [[Dublin]] ||<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |title=Second half onslaught sees Tipperary reach the promised land |first=Gavin |last=Cummiskey |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019040712/http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] || [[Gaelic football]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] || {{nts|82257}}{{refn|group=i|This attendance figure is for the originally scheduled 2016 All-Ireland final, which ended in a draw and thus required a replay.

==\n[[File:Wembley enggermatch.jpg|thumb|260px|Inside Wembley Stadium]]\n[[File:UAAP cheerdance competition at Araneta Coliseum.JPG|thumb|The annual [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]] routinely sells out the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena.]]\nThis section lists the most recent attendances at annual championship events (single decider matches or the final match in a best-of series only) by total attendance. It also includes domestic leagues and competitions. Additionally, it includes the finals of top-level promotion playoffs, in which teams play to determine potential or confirmed [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to a country's top league level in the next season. It has to be noted that the listed crowd figures are often a reflection of a championship venue's capacity, as demand for these events is generally so high that any stadium or arena would be filled to capacity.\n\nThe method by which championship venue(s) are determined can indirectly affect the attendance of such a match.\n\nIn most competitions that use a best-of final series, each individual match typically takes place at one team's home venue. In the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], a competition in which no team has its own home arena, finals matches (including any that can potentially end a series) are held at three large venues in or near Metro Manila: [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], [[Mall of Asia Arena]] and sometimes [[Philippine Arena]].\n\nIn most competitions that have a one-off final, the site is determined well in advance. Some competitions have a permanent site for their finals. Two notable examples are the [[Australian Football League]], whose [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] is always at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG), and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which holds its final matches in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|Gaelic football]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|hurling]] at [[Croke Park]]. Others determine the final venue anywhere from months to years before the event, such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], which determines the host of the [[Super Bowl]] more than three years in advance.\n\nHowever, one transnational club event in [[rugby union]] (whose final attendance is listed in [[#International club championship final events|a separate table]]) uses a very different system. In [[Super Rugby]], the final is awarded to the finalist that finished higher in the league table during the regular season. Another transnational club event in the same sport, [[Pro14]] (originally the Celtic League), used the same method to determine the host of its final until [[2015 Pro12 Grand Final|2015]], when it began to use a predetermined site.\n\nAs of the 2018 season, all 10 American college sports conferences that sponsor [[College football|football]] in the top-level [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] hold season-ending conference championship games in that sport. Of these leagues, six have a permanent site for their title games and four award hosting rights to the division champion with the better record in conference play (with tiebreakers used as needed).\n\nFor the purposes of this table, \"domestic\" is defined to include leagues which are historically focused in one country, but may have teams in one or more nearby countries. Examples of this phenomenon include:\n* Of the six largest [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|professional leagues in English-speaking North America]], only the two gridiron football leagues\u2014the NFL and CFL\u2014operate on one side of the U.S.\u2013Canada border. Of the four traditional \"major leagues\", only the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] has more than one team in Canada; as of the upcoming {{NHL Year|2019|app=season}}, it has 24 teams in the U.S. and seven in Canada, and will add [[Seattle NHL team|one U.S. team]] for 2021\u201322. [[Major League Soccer]], in recent years becoming increasingly accepted as a fifth \"major league\", currently has 21 U.S. teams and three Canadian teams, and will add four more U.S. teams by 2022.\n* The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], which governs Gaelic games, is mostly restricted to the island of Ireland, although teams from [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York City]] participate in its senior championships.\n* Two major Australian leagues\u2014the National Rugby League (rugby league) and A-League (association football)\u2014have included a team from New Zealand since their inception.\n* The vast majority of the teams competing in rugby league's Super League have been from England. Only three teams from outside the country, two from France and one from Wales, have ever competed in the league, and only one of these teams (from France) currently competes at this level.\n* Although the Challenge Cup of rugby league currently includes teams from France, Ireland, Scotland, Serbia, and Wales, and has in the past also had teams from Canada and Russia, the overwhelming majority of the competing teams are from England.\n* The English association football pyramid includes several clubs from Wales, although Welsh clubs do not necessarily participate at every level in a given season. As of the current 2019\u201320 season, no Welsh teams play in the Premier League following the relegation of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], which had played at that level in 2013\u201314 and 2018\u201319. [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] played in the Premier League from 2011\u201312 to 2017\u201318.\n* The Kontinental Hockey League is headquartered in Moscow and is mostly a Russian league, although in its most recent 2018\u201319 season it also had teams in Belarus, China, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Slovakia.\n\nThe [[EuroLeague]] in basketball is transnational in that it includes teams from multiple European countries, but is domestic in the sense of being a championship for the single entity of Europe. It is governed by [[Euroleague Basketball]], an explicitly pan-European body that is independent of the continental governing body of [[FIBA Europe]].\n\nThis contrasts with leagues such as Super Rugby and Pro14, which operate in multiple countries with more than one team in most (Super Rugby) or all (Pro14) of their participating countries, and also make no pretense of being a championship for a continental-size region.\n\n<!--\nNOTICE:\nThis section is meant for games where the championship was won. This includes all games in which the FINAL was a one-game affair. For best-of-x FINALS series, only include the game when the title was won (this inevitably includes all Game 7s in the finals).\n\nDon't add games where the title was not won. This includes any of the first three games in a best-of-7 finals, any game from the semifinals, quarterfinals, any stage in the playoffs, elimination round, regular season, and preseason. Preseason championships may be added. Finals of promotion playoffs may also be added.\n\nDon't add games from past seasons, even if they set records\u2014this is specifically for the MOST RECENT championship for which attendance figures are readily available.\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!Event||Sport||Country||Competition||data-sort-type=\"number\"|Crowd||Year||Venue||City||Ref\n|-\n| [[AFL Grand Final]] || [[Australian rules football]] || Australia || [[Australian Football League]] || {{nts|100014}} || [[2019 AFL Grand Final|2019]] || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] ||[[Melbourne]] ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-09-28/match-report-2019-grand-final-richmond-v-greater-western-sydney |title=Orange crushed: Tigers roar once more under Dimma's dynasty |first=Riley |last=Beveridge |publisher=Australian Football League |date=28 September 2019 |accessdate=30 September 2019 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[FA Cup Final]] || Association football || England || [[FA Cup]] || {{nts|85854}} || [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefa.com/competitions/thefacup/match-stats?season=2018&competition=1&match=1054822 |title=The Emirates FA Cup, Match Stats: Manchester City 6\u20130 Watford |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |date=18 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Championship play-offs|EFL Championship Play-off]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Championship]] || {{nts|85826}} || [[2019 EFL Championship play-off Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London ||<ref name=\"2019 Championship playoff\">{{cite web |url=https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |title=Report: Championship Play-Off Final |publisher=[[English Football League]] |date=27 May 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527204140/https://www.efl.com/news/2019/may/report-championship-play-off-final/ |archive-date=27 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[EFL Trophy]] Final || Association football || England || [[EFL Trophy]] || {{nts|85021}} || [[2019 EFL Trophy Final|2019]] || [[Wembley Stadium]] || London || <ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |title=Checkatrade Trophy Final |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 March 2019 |accessdate=2019-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617091347/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47709134 |archive-date=17 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n|-\n| [[Big 12 Championship Game]] || [[American football]] || United States || [[Big 12 Conference]] football || {{nts|83114}} || [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|2018]] || [[AT&T Stadium]] || [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] || <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |title=Gamecast: Dr Pepper Big 12 Championship |website=ESPN.com |date=December 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222152322/http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401056698 |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[NRL Grand Final]] || [[Rugby league]] || Australia|| [[National Rugby League]] || {{nts|82688}} || [[2018 NRL Grand Final|2018]] || [[Stadium Australia]] || Sydney ||<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |title=Match Centre, Telstra Premiership Grand Final |website=National Rugby League |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=22 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001030928/https://www.nrl.com/draw/nrl-premiership/2018/grand-final/roosters-vs-storm/ |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]] || [[Hurling]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] || 82,300 || [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2017]] || [[Croke Park]] || [[Dublin]] ||<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |title=Second half onslaught sees Tipperary reach the promised land |first=Gavin |last=Cummiskey |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019040712/http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/second-half-onslaught-sees-tipperary-reach-the-promised-land-1.2779206 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] || [[Gaelic football]] || Ireland || [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] || {{nts|82257}}{{refn|group=i|This attendance figure is for the originally scheduled 2016 All-Ireland final, which ended in a draw and thus required a replay.

It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''. The song is popular among [[dancehall]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and is widely regarded in the United Kingdom as a club classic.\n\n==Development==\nDJ Muggs has stated that he originally produced the beat for Cypress Hill, but rapper B-Real did not want to record at that time. It was subsequently offered to [[Ice Cube]], who refused it, before finally being taken and used by House of Pain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/12/how-we-made-cypress-hill-insane-in-the-brain-muggs-sen-dog|title=How we made Cypress Hill's Insane in the Brain|last=Simpson|first=Interviews by Dave|date=2019-02-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-23|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\n===Samples===\nThe song features a distinctive [[French horn|horn]] [[fanfare]] intro, sampled from [[Bob & Earl|Bob & Earl's]] 1963 track \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\". The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.
