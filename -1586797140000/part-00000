In January 1995, he joined the staff of ''College Sports'' magazine in [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey|Whitehouse Station, N.J.]], where he was the primary copy editor of seven professional and college sports yearbooks, and a copy editor and occasional contributor to ''College Sports'' monthly magazine. He continued his sportswriting as a feature writer for publications by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Mesquite Championship Rodeo]] from 1997-2005.\n\n=== Catholic press experience ===\nIn the summer of 1997, Howard moved to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and joined the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas|Dallas Diocese]] semimonthly newspaper ''Texas Catholic'' as a staff writer.

With a staff of four, ''The Catholic Herald'' added \"Colorado\" to its name and upgraded its frequency from monthly to twice a month (first and third Fridays). In May 2006, the ''Herald'' won the CPA's First Place General Excellence award in its circulation category (17,001-40,000 households), the highest award the paper can win. From 2006 until his departure in 2014, the ''Herald'' had won two dozen CPA awards. Circulation of the ''Herald'' remained steady at nearly 30,000 registered households. During this time, Howard also expanded the ''Herald's'' reach by adding a radio studio to the office, and brought the ''Herald'' into social media. Among his editorial highlights are covering [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s return to [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in the fall of 2006 and [[World Youth Day 2008|World Youth Day]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Howard was elected to the Catholic Press Association board of directors for a three-year term, and was re-elected in 2013.

From 1988 to 1990, he was sports editor of the student newspaper, ''The Aquinas''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aquinas.jlcclients.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050041/http://aquinas.jlcclients.com/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Secular journalism experience ===\nHoward joined [[Steve Forbes|Forbes Newspapers]] in [[Somerville, New Jersey]], in July 1992 and served as the primary sportswriter and copy editor of ''The Metuchen-Edison Review'' and ''Highland Park Herald'' weekly community newspapers. In January 1995, he joined the staff of ''College Sports'' magazine in [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey|Whitehouse Station, N.J.]], where he was the primary copy editor of seven professional and college sports yearbooks, and a copy editor and occasional contributor to ''College Sports'' monthly magazine. He continued his sportswriting as a feature writer for publications by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Mesquite Championship Rodeo]] from 1997-2005.\n\n=== Catholic press experience ===\nIn the summer of 1997, Howard moved to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and joined the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas|Dallas Diocese]] semimonthly newspaper ''Texas Catholic'' as a staff writer. He eventually became the news editor and helped found the paper's website and blog. He left ''Texas Catholic'' in the spring of 2005 to become editor of ''The Colorado Catholic Herald''. During his time at ''Texas Catholic'' he won seven [[Catholic Press Association]] (CPA) awards, two Katie awards from the Dallas Press Club, and covered in person the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] from [[Poland]] and the subsequent [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] in [[Rome]] in April 2005.\n\nBishop Sheridan hired Howard to restructure operations and redesign the [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] diocesan newspaper in June 2005. With a staff of four, ''The Catholic Herald'' added \"Colorado\" to its name and upgraded its frequency from monthly to twice a month (first and third Fridays). In May 2006, the ''Herald'' won the CPA's First Place General Excellence award in its circulation category (17,001-40,000 households), the highest award the paper can win. From 2006 until his departure in 2014, the ''Herald'' had won two dozen CPA awards. Circulation of the ''Herald'' remained steady at nearly 30,000 registered households. During this time, Howard also expanded the ''Herald's'' reach by adding a radio studio to the office, and brought the ''Herald'' into social media. Among his editorial highlights are covering [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s return to [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in the fall of 2006 and [[World Youth Day 2008|World Youth Day]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Howard was elected to the Catholic Press Association board of directors for a three-year term, and was re-elected in 2013.
