CEC officers are professional [[engineers]] and [[architects]], acquisitions specialists and [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Combat Warfare Officers.  They are responsible for executing and managing the planning, design, acquisition, construction, operation, and maintenance of the Navy's shore facilities.  The Civil Engineer Corps is under the command of the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]].

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n[[File:U.S. Naval insignia per USMC regulation.jpg|thumb|U.S. Naval insignia, brass subdued per USMC regulation for officers in CBs transferred to the Corps.]]\n\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort.

For CEC the standard gold and silver officer corps insignia was replaced by a brass subdued one on the garrison hat.  The battalions involved were the 18th, 19th, 25th, 53rd and 121st.(see [[17th Marine Regiment]], [[18th Marine Regiment]], [[19th Marine Regiment]], and [[20th Marine Regiment]])   The 31st and 133rd CBs were issued USMC fatigues and attached to the shore parties of the [[4th Marine Division]] and [[5th Marine Division]] for [[Iwo Jima]].

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N.

For CEC the standard gold and silver officer corps insignia was replaced by a brass subdued one on the garrison hat.  The battalions involved were the 18th, 19th, 25th, 53rd and 121st.(see [[17th Marine Regiment]], [[18th Marine Regiment]], [[19th Marine Regiment]], and [[20th Marine Regiment]])   The 31st and 133rd CBs were issued USMC fatigues and attached to the shore parties of the [[4th Marine Division]] and [[5th Marine Division]] for [[Iwo Jima]].  The CEC involved would have worn the subdued insignia also.  Other battalions were tasked with Marine Corps shore party assignments both prior and post Iwo Jima.\n\n\n\n===USMC Shore party Commanders===\n*Guam:........ [[3rd Marine Regiment]], Cmdr.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, lead by  Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the [[invasion of Sicily]]. <ref name=\"Fane\"/><ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> When the unit returned to Camp Peary most of the men were assigned to the new Naval Combat Demolition Units being formed there.   \n\n[[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] were led by junior CEC officers.<ref>Seabee online magazine- this week in Seabee History[http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/09/12/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-sept-11/]</ref>  There were over 200 NCDUs formed with all but five being reqresitioned for the UDTs.\n\n===UDTs===\n[[File:80-G-244701 Lt Crist, Lt Cmdr.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and gather qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit.  Lt. Crist had gotten 30 officers and 150  enlisted together when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and UDT 2 had  Lt. Crist.  Lt Crist would become the first Training Officer of the UDT  program in Hawaii.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as Commander of UDT 3.   For the Marianas operation (Kwajelein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, [[Eniwetok]], and Guam) Admiral Turner recommended sixty silver stars and over three hundred [[bronze star]]s with Vs for the Seabees and others of UDTs 1-7<ref name= \"Frogman\">\"America's First Frogman\", Elizabeth K.

The nearby [[Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms]] was founded in 1952.\n\nThe first recorded exploration of Twentynine Palms was made in 1855 by desert surveyor Colonel Henry Washington. He found Native Americans, principally from the Chemeheuvi tribe, living in the surrounding hills and near the spring they called \"Mar-rah,\" meaning \"land of little water.\" The spring, which is now called the Oasis of Mara, is located on the grounds of the historic 29 Palms Inn adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park Headquarters and Oasis Visitor Center.<ref> https://www.ci.twentynine-palms.ca.us/about</ref>\n\nThe early Native American inhabitants (Serrano, Chemheuvi, and Cahuilla) were followed in the 1870s by prospectors in search of gold. The Oasis of Mara was a favorite camping spot. There, prospectors would rest and replenish their water supplies before venturing farther into the unknown desert. The area was then generally known as Palms Springs. \n\nLegend says that the name of Twentynine Palms was first used by these gold miners because of the 29 Washingtonia filifera palm trees surrounding the Oasis, and in fact the area was designated as such in the description of a mining claim by two partners known as McKenzie and Germain, who stated that their claim was a certain distance from 29 Palms Springs. However, it is also known that an A.P. Green, a member of an 1858 survey party, reported that there were 26, not 29, fine, large palm trees at the oasis. There are many stories told of the derivation of our present name, including one that claims that it was Colonel Washington who named it for the number of palm trees he found at the oasis at the time of his 1855 survey, but this has never been authenticated. \n\nIn the 1870s, local Native Americans led prospectors to locations south and east of the oasis where gold had been found. Thus, mining began in the area that later became known as Gold Park. It was not long before freighters were hauling supplies to be used not only in the Gold Park District, but also in the Dale Mining District east of Twentynine Palms, where other valuable deposits had been located. Gold mining continued sporadically through the following years, but ended about the time of the onset of World War I, when no further new ore deposit discoveries were occurring.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 5667\n|1980= 7465\n|1990= 11821\n|2000= 14764\n|2010= 25048\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26418\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nIts population as of July 1, 2013 was estimated at 25,768.<ref name=\"quickfacts.census.gov\">{{Cite web\n |url         = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0680994.html\n |title       = Twentynine Palms (city) QuickFacts\n |publisher   = [[United States Census Bureau]]\n |accessdate  = January 9, 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150110012439/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0680994.html\n |archivedate = January 10, 2015\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0680994|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Twentynine Palms city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> there were 25,048 people, 8,095 households, and 5,847 families residing in the city.

Birmingham serves as an important regional hub and is associated with the [[Deep South]], [[Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion|Piedmont]], and [[Appalachia]]n regions of the nation.\n\nBirmingham was founded in 1871, during the post\u2013[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction era]], through the merger of three farm towns, most notably [[Elyton]]. The new city was named for [[Birmingham]], [[England]], the United Kingdom's [[Second city of the United Kingdom|second largest city]] and then a major industrial city. The Alabama city annexed its smaller neighbors as it developed into a major industrial center based on mining, the [[steel|iron and steel industry]], and [[rail transport]].

Its rapid growth from 1881 through 1920 earned it the nicknames \"The Magic City\" and \"The [[Pittsburgh]] of the South\". Its major industries were iron and steel production. Major components of the railroad industry, including rails and railroad cars, were made in Birmingham. The two primary hubs of railroading in the \"[[Deep South]]\" have been Birmingham and [[Atlanta]].  The economy began to diversify in the latter half of the twentieth century, as the steel mills began to shut down. Banking, telecommunications, transportation, electrical power transmission, medical care, college education, and insurance have become its major economic activities. Birmingham now ranks as one of the largest [[banking]] centers in the U.S. It is also one of the important business centers of the Southeast.\n\nIn [[higher education]], Birmingham has been the location of the [[University of Alabama School of Medicine]] (formerly the Medical College of Alabama) and the [[University of Alabama School of Dentistry]] since 1947. In 1969, it gained the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], one of three main campuses of the [[University of Alabama System]]. It is also home to three private institutions: [[Samford University]], [[Birmingham-Southern College]], and [[Miles College]]. The Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy, law, engineering, and nursing. The city has three of the state's five law schools: [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], and [[Miles Law School]]. Birmingham is also the headquarters of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] and the [[Southeastern Conference]], one of the major U.S. collegiate athletic conferences.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Birmingham, Alabama}}\n\n===Founding and early growth===\n[[File:Birmingham AL.png|thumb|left|L&N rail yard at Birmingham, ca. 1900]]\n\nBirmingham was founded on June 1, 1871, by the Elyton Land Company, whose investors included cotton planters, bankers and railroad entrepreneurs. It sold lots near the planned crossing of the [[Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad|Alabama & Chattanooga]] and [[South & North Alabama Railroad|South & North Alabama]] railroads, including land that was part of the Benjamin P. Worthington plantation.  The city was chartered by the state legislature on December 19, 1871.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 8, 2008 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1421 |title= Birmingham |author=Herbert J. \"Jim\" Lewis }}</ref>  The first business at that crossroads was a trading post and country store operated by Marre and Allen. The site of the railroad crossing was notable for its proximity to nearby deposits of iron ore, coal, and [[limestone]]&nbsp;\u2013 the three main raw materials used in making steel.\n\n[[File: OUR BABY DOFFER.jpg|thumb|right|Child labor at Avondale Mills in Birmingham in 1910; photo by [[Lewis Hine]]]]\nBirmingham is the only place where significant amounts of all three minerals can be found in close proximity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1597 |title= Birmingham Iron and Steel companies |last=Lewis |first=David |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Alabama |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> From the start the new city was planned as a center of industry. To emphasize this point, the city's founders named it in honor of Birmingham, England, one of the world's premier industrial cities. The growth of the planned city was impeded by an outbreak of [[cholera]] and a [[Panic of 1873|Wall Street crash]] in 1873. Soon afterward, however, it began to develop at an explosive rate.\n\nThe [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company|Tennessee Coal and Iron Company]] (TCI) became the leading steel producer in the South by 1892. In 1907 [[U.S. Steel]] purchased it and became the most important political and economic force in Birmingham. It resisted new industry, however, to keep wage rates down.<ref name=Connerly/>{{rp|119}}\n\nIn 1911, the town of Elyton and several other surrounding towns were absorbed into Birmingham. From the early 20th century, the city grew so rapidly it earned the sobriquet \"The Magic City\". The downtown was redeveloped from a low-rise commercial and residential district into a busy grid of neoclassical mid- and high-rise buildings crisscrossed by [[streetcar]] lines. Between 1902 and 1912, four large office buildings were constructed at the intersection of 20th Street, the central north-south spine of the city, and 1st Avenue North, which connected the warehouses and industrial facilities along the east-west railroad corridor. This early group of skyscrapers was nicknamed the \"[[Heaviest Corner on Earth]]\".\n\nBirmingham was hit by the [[1916 Irondale earthquake]] ({{M|l|link=y}} 5.1, intensity VII (''Very strong'')). A few buildings in the area were slightly damaged. The earthquake was felt as far as Atlanta and neighboring states.\n\n{{wide image|Birmingham Alabama c1916 LOC 3c26173u.jpg|800px|alt=Birmingham, 1916|Birmingham, 1916}}\nWhile excluded from the best-paying industrial jobs, [[African Americans]] joined the migration of residents from rural areas to the city, drawn by economic opportunity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s struck Birmingham particularly hard, as the sources of capital fueling the city's growth rapidly dried up at the same time farm laborers, driven off the land, made their way to the city in search of work. Hundreds poured into the city, many riding in empty boxcars. \"[[Hobo jungle]]s\" were established in Boyles, the Twenty-fourth Street Viaduct, Green Springs Bridge, East Thomas, Pratt City, Carbon Hill and Jasper.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last1=Flynt |first1=Wayne |title=Poor But Proud |date=February 5, 2016 |publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]}}</ref> In 1934, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] called Birmingham the \"worst-hit town in the country.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[New Deal]] programs put many city residents to work in [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] programs, and they made important contributions to the city's infrastructure and artistic legacy, including such key improvements as [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan's tower]] and [[Oak Mountain State Park]].\n\nThe World War II demand for steel followed by a post-war building boom spurred Birmingham's rapid return to prosperity. Manufacturing diversified beyond the production of raw materials. Major civic institutions such as schools, parks, and museums, also expanded in scope.<ref name=\"Atkins-1981\">{{cite book |title=The Valley and the Hills: An Illustrated History of Birmingham & Jefferson County |last=Atkins |first=Leah Rawls |year=1981 |publisher=Windsor Publications |isbn= 978-0-89781-031-9}}</ref>\n\nDespite the city's growing population and wealth, Birmingham residents were markedly underrepresented in the state legislature. Although the state constitution required [[redistricting]] in accordance with changes in the decennial census, the state legislature did not act until the 1970s when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' forced it to do so. Birmingham-area voters had sued to force redistricting, and the Court in its ruling cited the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\". The Court found that the geographic basis of the state senate, which gave each county one senator, gave undue influence to rural counties. Representatives of rural counties also had disproportionate power in the state House of Representatives and had failed to provide support for infrastructure and other improvements in urban centers such as Birmingham, having little sympathy for urban populations. Prior to this time, the Alabama Legislature (known as the General Assembly until 1901) ran county governments as extensions of the state through their legislative delegations.\n\n===Birmingham civil rights movement===\n{{main|Birmingham campaign}}\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Birmingham gained national and international attention as a center of activity during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Based on their members working in mining and industry, in the 1950s independent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) chapters had ready access to dynamite and other bomb materials. Whites unhappy with social changes in the 1950s committed racially motivated bombings of the houses of black families who moved into new neighborhoods or who were politically active, earning Birmingham the nickname \"[[Bombingham]]\".\n\nLocally, the civil rights movement's activists were led by [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], a fiery preacher who became legendary for his fearlessness in the face of such violence.<ref>{{cite news |last= Cohen |first= Adam |title= Back to \"Bombingham\" |work=TIME |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986714,00.html |date=July 21, 1997 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> But he found city officials resistant to making changes for integration or lessening of [[Jim Crow]].\n\n[[File:16th Street Baptist Church.JPG|thumb|[[16th Street Baptist Church]], now a National Historic Landmark]]\nA watershed in the civil rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded, come to Birmingham to help end public [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].<ref name=\"test\">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_90.shtml Clayborne Carson]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \"King Maker\", ''American Heritage'', Winter 2010.</ref>\n\nTogether they launched \"Project C\" (for \"Confrontation\"), a massive non-violent demonstration against the Jim Crow system. While imprisoned in April 1963 for having taken part in a nonviolent protest, Dr. King wrote the now famous \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\", a defining treatise in his cause against segregation. During April and May, daily sit-ins and mass marches organized and led by movement leader [[James Bevel]] were met with police repression, tear gas, attack dogs, fire hoses, and arrests. More than 3,000 people were arrested during these protests, many of them children. King and Bevel filled the jails with students to keep the demonstrations going.\n\nBy September the SCLC and city were negotiating to end an economic [[boycott]] and desegregate stores and other facilities. On a Sunday in September 1963, a [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bomb went off at the 16th Street Baptist Church]], killing four black girls.<ref name=\"gado\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/birmingham_church/3.html |last=Gado |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=Bombingham |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com/Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818222057/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/birmingham_church/3.html |archivedate=August 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The activists' protests and national outrage about the police and KKK violence contributed to the ultimate desegregation of public accommodations in Birmingham and also passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite news |work= Civil Rights Movement Veterans |title= The Birmingham Campaign |url= http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham |date= |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Birmingham Pledge, written by local attorney James Rotch, was introduced at the Martin Luther King Unity Breakfast.

In 1971 Birmingham celebrated its centennial with a round of public-works improvements, including the upgrading of [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan Park]] and the construction of a major downtown convention center containing a 2,500-seat symphony hall, theater, 19,000-seat arena, and exhibition halls. Birmingham's banking institutions enjoyed considerable growth as well, and new skyscrapers were constructed in the city center for the first time since the 1920s. These projects helped the city's economy to diversify, but did not prevent the exodus of many of the city's residents to independent suburbs. [[Suburbanization]] was a national trend. In 1979 Birmingham elected Dr. [[Richard Arrington Jr.]] as its first African-American mayor.\n\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline.jpeg|thumb|Birmingham skyline at night from atop the City Federal Building, July 1, 2015]]\nThe population inside Birmingham's city limits has fallen over the past few decades, due in large part to \"[[white flight]]\" from the city to the surrounding suburbs and loss of jobs following industrial and railroad restructuring.

The valley is drained by small creeks (Village Creek, Valley Creek) which flow into the [[Black Warrior River]]. The valley was bisected by the principal railroad corridor, along which most of the early manufacturing operations began.\n\n[[Red Mountain (Birmingham)|Red Mountain]] lies immediately south of downtown. Many of Birmingham's television and radio broadcast towers are lined up along this prominent ridge. The \"Over the Mountain\" area, including Shades Valley, [[Shades Mountain]] and beyond, was largely shielded from the industrial smoke and rough streets of the industrial city. This is the setting for Birmingham's more affluent suburbs of [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], [[Vestavia Hills, Alabama|Vestavia Hills]], [[Homewood, Alabama|Homewood]], and [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]]. South of Shades Valley is the [[Cahaba River]] basin, one of the most diverse river ecosystems in the United States.\n\n[[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]], a lower ridge, flanks the city to the north and divides Jones Valley from much more rugged land to the north.

Snow occasionally falls during winter, but many winters pass with no snow or only a trace. However, {{convert|10.3|in|cm|1}} fell on March 13, 1993, during the [[1993 Storm of the Century]], which established the highest daily snowfall, one-storm, and winter season total on record. Average snowfall over the winter season, based on the 1981\u20132010 period, is {{convert|1.6|in|cm|1|abbr=on}}, but, for the same period, median monthly snowfall for each month was zero.<ref name = \"NOAA txt\"/>\n\nThe spring and fall months are pleasant but variable as cold fronts frequently bring strong to severe thunderstorms and occasional tornadoes to the region. The fall season (primarily October) features less rainfall and fewer storms, as well as lower humidity than the spring, but November and early December represent a secondary severe weather season. Birmingham is in the heart of a [[Tornado Alley]] known as the [[Dixie Alley]] due to the high frequency of tornadoes in Central Alabama. The greater Birmingham area has been hit by two F5 tornadoes; one in Birmingham's northern suburbs in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1977|1977]], and second in the western suburbs in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1998|1998]]. The area was hit by [[2011 Tuscaloosa\u2013Birmingham tornado|an EF4 tornado]] which was part of the [[2011 Super Outbreak]]. In late summer and fall months, Birmingham experiences occasional tropical storms and hurricanes due to its proximity to the Central Gulf Coast.\n\nThe record high temperature is {{convert|107|\u00b0F|0}}, set on July 29, 1930,<ref name=\"Jul Averages\">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=7 |title=July Daily Averages for Birmingham, AL (35209) |publisher=Weather.com |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027154130/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=7 |archivedate=October 27, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> and the record low is {{convert|\u221210|\u00b0F|0}}, set on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 13, 1899]].<ref name=\"Feb Averages\">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=2 |title=February Daily Averages for Birmingham, AL (35209) |publisher=weather.com |accessdate=April 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628031821/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=2 |archivedate=June 28, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box|location= [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham Int'l]], Alabama (1981\u20132010 normals,{{efn|Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.}} extremes 1895\u2013present){{efn|Official records for Birmingham kept April 1895 to December 1929 at the Weather Bureau Office and at Birmingham Int'l since January 1930.

The streets were numbered from west to east, leaving 20th Street to form the central spine of downtown, anchored on the north by Capital Park and stretching into the slopes of Red Mountain to the south. A \"railroad reservation\" was granted through the center of the city, running east to west and zoned solely for industrial uses. As the city grew, bridges and underpasses separated the streets from the railroad bed, lending this central reservation some of the impact of a river (without the pleasant associations of a waterfront). From the start, Birmingham's streets and avenues were unusually wide at {{convert|80|to|100|ft|m}}, purportedly to help evacuate unhealthy smoke.\n\nIn the early 20th century professional planners helped lay out many of the new industrial settlements and [[company town]]s in the Birmingham District, including Corey (now [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]]), which was developed for the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (subsequently purchased by [[U.S. Steel]]). At the same time, a movement to consolidate several neighboring cities gained momentum. Although local referendums indicated mixed feelings about annexation, the Alabama legislature enacted an expansion of Birmingham's corporate limits that became effective on January 1, 1910.\n\nThe Robert Jemison Company developed many residential neighborhoods to the south and west of Birmingham which are still renowned for their aesthetic quality.\n\nA 1924 plan for a system of parks, commissioned from the [[Olmsted Brothers]], is seeing renewed interest with several significant new parks and greenways under development. Birmingham officials have approved a City Center Master Plan developed by [[Urban Design Associates]] of Pittsburgh, which advocates strongly for more residential development in the downtown area. The plan also called for a major park over several blocks of the central railroad reservation: [[Railroad Park]], which opened in 2010. Along with Ruffner Mountain Park and Red Mountain Park, Birmingham ranks first in the United States for public green space per resident.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\nThe city of Birmingham has a higher than average percentage of households without a car.

Its rapid growth from 1881 through 1920 earned it the nicknames \"The Magic City\" and \"The [[Pittsburgh]] of the South\". Its major industries were iron and steel production. Major components of the railroad industry, including rails and railroad cars, were made in Birmingham. The two primary hubs of railroading in the \"[[Deep South]]\" have been Birmingham and [[Atlanta]].  The economy began to diversify in the latter half of the twentieth century, as the steel mills began to shut down. Banking, telecommunications, transportation, electrical power transmission, medical care, college education, and insurance have become its major economic activities. Birmingham now ranks as one of the largest [[banking]] centers in the U.S. It is also one of the important business centers of the Southeast.\n\nIn [[higher education]], Birmingham has been the location of the [[University of Alabama School of Medicine]] (formerly the Medical College of Alabama) and the [[University of Alabama School of Dentistry]] since 1947. In 1969, it gained the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], one of three main campuses of the [[University of Alabama System]]. It is also home to three private institutions: [[Samford University]], [[Birmingham-Southern College]], and [[Miles College]]. The Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy, law, engineering, and nursing. The city has three of the state's five law schools: [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], and [[Miles Law School]]. Birmingham is also the headquarters of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] and the [[Southeastern Conference]], one of the major U.S. collegiate athletic conferences.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Birmingham, Alabama}}\n\n===Founding and early growth===\n[[File:Birmingham AL.png|thumb|left|L&N rail yard at Birmingham, ca. 1900]]\n\nBirmingham was founded on June 1, 1871, by the Elyton Land Company, whose investors included cotton planters, bankers and railroad entrepreneurs. It sold lots near the planned crossing of the [[Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad|Alabama & Chattanooga]] and [[South & North Alabama Railroad|South & North Alabama]] railroads, including land that was part of the Benjamin P. Worthington plantation.  The city was chartered by the state legislature on December 19, 1871.<ref>{{city web!http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1421 |title= Birmingham Chartered}}</ref>  The first business at that crossroads was a trading post and country store operated by Marre and Allen.

To emphasize this point, the city's founders named it in honor of Birmingham, England, one of the world's premier industrial cities. The growth of the planned city was impeded by an outbreak of [[cholera]] and a [[Panic of 1873|Wall Street crash]] in 1873. Soon afterward, however, it began to develop at an explosive rate.\n\nThe [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company|Tennessee Coal and Iron Company]] (TCI) became the leading steel producer in the South by 1892. In 1907 [[U.S. Steel]] purchased it and became the most important political and economic force in Birmingham. It resisted new industry, however, to keep wage rates down.<ref name=Connerly/>{{rp|119}}\n\nIn 1911, the town of Elyton and several other surrounding towns were absorbed into Birmingham. From the early 20th century, the city grew so rapidly it earned the sobriquet \"The Magic City\". The downtown was redeveloped from a low-rise commercial and residential district into a busy grid of neoclassical mid- and high-rise buildings crisscrossed by [[streetcar]] lines. Between 1902 and 1912, four large office buildings were constructed at the intersection of 20th Street, the central north-south spine of the city, and 1st Avenue North, which connected the warehouses and industrial facilities along the east-west railroad corridor. This early group of skyscrapers was nicknamed the \"[[Heaviest Corner on Earth]]\".\n\nBirmingham was hit by the [[1916 Irondale earthquake]] ({{M|l|link=y}} 5.1, intensity VII (''Very strong'')). A few buildings in the area were slightly damaged. The earthquake was felt as far as Atlanta and neighboring states.\n\n{{wide image|Birmingham Alabama c1916 LOC 3c26173u.jpg|800px|alt=Birmingham, 1916|Birmingham, 1916}}\nWhile excluded from the best-paying industrial jobs, [[African Americans]] joined the migration of residents from rural areas to the city, drawn by economic opportunity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s struck Birmingham particularly hard, as the sources of capital fueling the city's growth rapidly dried up at the same time farm laborers, driven off the land, made their way to the city in search of work. Hundreds poured into the city, many riding in empty boxcars. \"[[Hobo jungle]]s\" were established in Boyles, the Twenty-fourth Street Viaduct, Green Springs Bridge, East Thomas, Pratt City, Carbon Hill and Jasper.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last1=Flynt |first1=Wayne |title=Poor But Proud |date=February 5, 2016 |publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]}}</ref> In 1934, [[Franklin D.

Manufacturing diversified beyond the production of raw materials. Major civic institutions such as schools, parks, and museums, also expanded in scope.<ref name=\"Atkins-1981\">{{cite book |title=The Valley and the Hills: An Illustrated History of Birmingham & Jefferson County |last=Atkins |first=Leah Rawls |year=1981 |publisher=Windsor Publications |isbn= 978-0-89781-031-9}}</ref>\n\nDespite the city's growing population and wealth, Birmingham residents were markedly underrepresented in the state legislature. Although the state constitution required [[redistricting]] in accordance with changes in the decennial census, the state legislature did not act until the 1970s when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' forced it to do so. Birmingham-area voters had sued to force redistricting, and the Court in its ruling cited the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\". The Court found that the geographic basis of the state senate, which gave each county one senator, gave undue influence to rural counties. Representatives of rural counties also had disproportionate power in the state House of Representatives and had failed to provide support for infrastructure and other improvements in urban centers such as Birmingham, having little sympathy for urban populations. Prior to this time, the Alabama Legislature (known as the General Assembly until 1901) ran county governments as extensions of the state through their legislative delegations.\n\n===Birmingham civil rights movement===\n{{main|Birmingham campaign}}\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Birmingham gained national and international attention as a center of activity during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Based on their members working in mining and industry, in the 1950s independent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) chapters had ready access to dynamite and other bomb materials. Whites unhappy with social changes in the 1950s committed racially motivated bombings of the houses of black families who moved into new neighborhoods or who were politically active, earning Birmingham the nickname \"[[Bombingham]]\".\n\nLocally, the civil rights movement's activists were led by [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], a fiery preacher who became legendary for his fearlessness in the face of such violence.<ref>{{cite news |last= Cohen |first= Adam |title= Back to \"Bombingham\" |work=TIME |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986714,00.html |date=July 21, 1997 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> But he found city officials resistant to making changes for integration or lessening of [[Jim Crow]].\n\n[[File:16th Street Baptist Church.JPG|thumb|[[16th Street Baptist Church]], now a National Historic Landmark]]\nA watershed in the civil rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded, come to Birmingham to help end public [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].<ref name=\"test\">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_90.shtml Clayborne Carson]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \"King Maker\", ''American Heritage'', Winter 2010.</ref>\n\nTogether they launched \"Project C\" (for \"Confrontation\"), a massive non-violent demonstration against the Jim Crow system. While imprisoned in April 1963 for having taken part in a nonviolent protest, Dr. King wrote the now famous \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\", a defining treatise in his cause against segregation. During April and May, daily sit-ins and mass marches organized and led by movement leader [[James Bevel]] were met with police repression, tear gas, attack dogs, fire hoses, and arrests. More than 3,000 people were arrested during these protests, many of them children. King and Bevel filled the jails with students to keep the demonstrations going.\n\nBy September the SCLC and city were negotiating to end an economic [[boycott]] and desegregate stores and other facilities. On a Sunday in September 1963, a [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bomb went off at the 16th Street Baptist Church]], killing four black girls.<ref name=\"gado\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/birmingham_church/3.html |last=Gado |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=Bombingham |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com/Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818222057/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/birmingham_church/3.html |archivedate=August 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The activists' protests and national outrage about the police and KKK violence contributed to the ultimate desegregation of public accommodations in Birmingham and also passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite news |work= Civil Rights Movement Veterans |title= The Birmingham Campaign |url= http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham |date= |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Birmingham Pledge, written by local attorney James Rotch, was introduced at the Martin Luther King Unity Breakfast.

In 1971 Birmingham celebrated its centennial with a round of public-works improvements, including the upgrading of [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan Park]] and the construction of a major downtown convention center containing a 2,500-seat symphony hall, theater, 19,000-seat arena, and exhibition halls. Birmingham's banking institutions enjoyed considerable growth as well, and new skyscrapers were constructed in the city center for the first time since the 1920s. These projects helped the city's economy to diversify, but did not prevent the exodus of many of the city's residents to independent suburbs. [[Suburbanization]] was a national trend. In 1979 Birmingham elected Dr. [[Richard Arrington Jr.]] as its first African-American mayor.\n\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline.jpeg|thumb|Birmingham skyline at night from atop the City Federal Building, July 1, 2015]]\nThe population inside Birmingham's city limits has fallen over the past few decades, due in large part to \"[[white flight]]\" from the city to the surrounding suburbs and loss of jobs following industrial and railroad restructuring.

The valley is drained by small creeks (Village Creek, Valley Creek) which flow into the [[Black Warrior River]]. The valley was bisected by the principal railroad corridor, along which most of the early manufacturing operations began.\n\n[[Red Mountain (Birmingham)|Red Mountain]] lies immediately south of downtown. Many of Birmingham's television and radio broadcast towers are lined up along this prominent ridge. The \"Over the Mountain\" area, including Shades Valley, [[Shades Mountain]] and beyond, was largely shielded from the industrial smoke and rough streets of the industrial city. This is the setting for Birmingham's more affluent suburbs of [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], [[Vestavia Hills, Alabama|Vestavia Hills]], [[Homewood, Alabama|Homewood]], and [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]]. South of Shades Valley is the [[Cahaba River]] basin, one of the most diverse river ecosystems in the United States.\n\n[[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]], a lower ridge, flanks the city to the north and divides Jones Valley from much more rugged land to the north. The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] (now [[CSX Transportation]]) enters the valley through Boyles Gap, a prominent gap in the long low ridge.\n\nRuffner Mountain, due east of the heart of the city, is home to [[Ruffner Mountain Nature Preserve]], one of the largest urban nature reserves in the U.S.\n\nBirmingham is {{convert|147|mi}} west of [[Atlanta]], {{convert|92|mi}} north of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], {{convert|147|mi}} northeast of [[Meridian, Mississippi]], {{convert|239|mi}} southeast of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], {{convert|192|mi}} south of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and {{convert|148|mi}} southwest of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.maps.google.com| title=Google Maps| website=Maps.google.com| access-date=April 18, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220201329/http://www.maps.google.com/| archive-date=February 20, 2008| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> all via Interstate highways.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has an area of {{convert|384.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|378.3|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|6.6|km2|order=flip}}, or 1.71%, are water.<ref name=\"FactFinder\"/>\n\n===Suburbs===\nBirmingham has numerous suburbs.

Neighborhood associations are routinely consulted on matters related to zoning changes, liquor licenses, economic development, policing and other city services. Neighborhoods are also granted discretionary funds from the city's budget to use for [[capital improvement plan|capital improvements]]. Each neighborhood's officers meet with their peers to form Community Advisory Committees, which are granted broader powers over city departments. The presidents of these committees, in turn, form the Citizens' Advisory Board, which meets regularly with the mayor, council, and department heads.

Some of the school systems only have three to five schools. The metropolitan area's three largest school systems are the [[Jefferson County Schools (Alabama)|Jefferson County School System]], Birmingham City Schools, and the [[Shelby County Schools (Alabama)|Shelby County School System]]. However, there are many smaller school systems.\n\nThe Birmingham area is reputed to be the home of some of Alabama's best high schools, colleges and universities. In 2005, the [[Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School]] in [[Irondale, Alabama|Irondale]], an eastern suburb of Birmingham, was rated as the No. 1 high school in America by ''[[Newsweek]]''. The school remains among the nation's top \nhigh schools. [[Mountain Brook High School]] placed 250th on the list. Other area schools that have been rated among America's best in various publications include [[Homewood High School]], [[Vestavia Hills High School]], [[Hewitt-Trussville High School]], and the [[Alabama School of Fine Arts]] downtown. The metro area also has three highly regarded private college-preparatory schools: [[Saint Rose Academy]], in Birmingham proper; the [[Altamont School]], also in Birmingham proper; and [[Indian Springs School]] in north Shelby County near Pelham.\n\n[[File:UAB Blazer Hall.jpg|thumb|[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] ]]\nNoteworthy institutions of higher education in greater Birmingham include the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], [[Samford University]] (including the [[Cumberland School of Law]]), [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Miles College]], the independent [[Miles Law School]], [[Jefferson State Community College]], [[Birmingham-Southern College]], [[University of Montevallo]] (in Shelby County), [[Lawson State Community College]], and [[Virginia College]] in Birmingham, the largest career college based in Birmingham.\n\n==Media==\n{{see also|List of newspapers in Alabama|List of television stations in Alabama|List of radio stations in Alabama}}\nBirmingham is served by one major newspaper, ''[[The Birmingham News]]'' (circulation 150,346), which changed from daily to thrice-weekly publication on October 1, 2012.

The streets were numbered from west to east, leaving 20th Street to form the central spine of downtown, anchored on the north by Capital Park and stretching into the slopes of Red Mountain to the south. A \"railroad reservation\" was granted through the center of the city, running east to west and zoned solely for industrial uses. As the city grew, bridges and underpasses separated the streets from the railroad bed, lending this central reservation some of the impact of a river (without the pleasant associations of a waterfront). From the start, Birmingham's streets and avenues were unusually wide at {{convert|80|to|100|ft|m}}, purportedly to help evacuate unhealthy smoke.\n\nIn the early 20th century professional planners helped lay out many of the new industrial settlements and [[company town]]s in the Birmingham District, including Corey (now [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]]), which was developed for the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (subsequently purchased by [[U.S. Steel]]). At the same time, a movement to consolidate several neighboring cities gained momentum. Although local referendums indicated mixed feelings about annexation, the Alabama legislature enacted an expansion of Birmingham's corporate limits that became effective on January 1, 1910.\n\nThe Robert Jemison Company developed many residential neighborhoods to the south and west of Birmingham which are still renowned for their aesthetic quality.\n\nA 1924 plan for a system of parks, commissioned from the [[Olmsted Brothers]], is seeing renewed interest with several significant new parks and greenways under development. Birmingham officials have approved a City Center Master Plan developed by [[Urban Design Associates]] of Pittsburgh, which advocates strongly for more residential development in the downtown area. The plan also called for a major park over several blocks of the central railroad reservation: [[Railroad Park]], which opened in 2010. Along with Ruffner Mountain Park and Red Mountain Park, Birmingham ranks first in the United States for public green space per resident.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\nThe city of Birmingham has a higher than average percentage of households without a car.

Wundt's paternal grandfather was Friedrich Peter Wundt (1742\u20131805), Professor of Geography and pastor in [[Wieblingen]]. When Wundt was about four years of age, his family moved to [[Heidelsheim]], then a small medieval town in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>Lamberti, 1995, pp. 15-22.</ref>\n\nBorn in Germany at a time that was considered very economically stable, Wundt grew up during a period in which the reinvestment of wealth into educational, medical and technological development was commonplace. An economic strive for the advancement of knowledge catalyzed the development of a new psychological study method, and facilitated his development into the prominent psychological figure he is today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb00821.0001.001|title=Germany, 1866-1945|first=Gordon Alexander|last=Craig|date=22 October 1999|accessdate=22 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nWundt studied from 1851 to 1856 at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], at the [[University of Heidelberg]], and at the [[University of Berlin]]. After graduating as a [[doctor of medicine]] from Heidelberg (1856), doctoral advisor [[Karl Ewald Hasse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Wundt studied briefly with [[Johannes Peter M\u00fcller]], before joining the Heidelberg University's staff, becoming an assistant to the [[Physics|physicist]] and physiologist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1858 with responsibility for teaching the laboratory course in physiology. There he wrote ''Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception'' (1858\u20131862). In 1864, he became Associate Professor for [[Anthropology]] and [[Medical Psychology]] and published a textbook about human physiology. However, his main interest, according to his lectures and classes, was not in the medical field \u2013 he was more attracted by psychology and related subjects. His lectures on psychology were published as ''Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology'' in 1863\u20131864. Wundt applied himself to writing a work that came to be one of the most important in the history of psychology, ''Principles of Physiological Psychology'', in 1874. This was the first textbook that was written pertaining to the field of experimental psychology.<ref>Lamberti, 1995, pp. 81-86, pp. 114-134.</ref>\n\nIn 1867, near Heidelberg, Wundt met Sophie Mau (1844\u20131912). She was the eldest daughter of the Kiel theology professor [[:de: Heinrich August Mau]] and his wife Louise, n\u00e9e von Rumohr, and a sister of the archaeologist [[August Mau]]. They married on 14 August 1872 in Kiel.<ref>Lamberti, 1995, pp. 87-113.</ref> The couple had three children: Eleanor (*1876\u20131957), who became an assistant to her father in many ways, Louise, called Lilli, (*1880\u20131884) and [[:de: Max Wundt]] (*1879\u20131963), who became a philosophy professor.\n\nIn 1875, Wundt was promoted to professor of \"Inductive Philosophy\" in Zurich, and in 1875, Wundt was made professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig where [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795\u20131878) and [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] (1801\u20131887) had initiated research on sensory psychology and [[psychophysics]] \u2013 and where two centuries earlier [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] had developed his philosophy and [[theoretical psychology]], which strongly influenced Wundt's intellectual path. Wundt's admiration for Ernst Heinrich Weber was clear from his memoirs where he proclaimed that Weber should be regarded as  the father of experimental psychology: \u201cI would rather call Weber the father of experimental psychology\u2026It was Weber\u2019s great contribution to think of measuring psychic quantities and of showing the exact relationships between them, to be the first to understand this and carry it out.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=David|date=Autumn 2017|title=David K.

The new lab was full of graduate students carrying out research on topics assigned by Wundt, and it soon attracted young scholars from all over the world who were eager to learn about the new science that Wundt had developed.\n\nThe University of Leipzig assigned Wundt a lab in 1876 to store equipment he had brought from Zurich. Located in the Konvikt building, many of Wundt's demonstrations took place in this laboratory due to the inconvenience of transporting his equipment between the lab and his classroom. Wundt arranged for the construction of suitable instruments and collected many pieces of equipment such as [[tachistoscope]]s, [[Clock|chronoscopes]], pendulums, electrical devices, timers, and sensory mapping devices, and was known to assign an instrument to various graduate students with the task of developing uses for future research in experimentation.<ref>Wontorra: Fr\u00fche apparative Psychologie, 2009.</ref> Between 1885 and 1909, there were 15 assistants.<ref name=\"Meischner-Metge2003\">Anneros Meischner-Metge: Wilhelm Wundt und seine Sch\u00fcler.

The laboratory grew and encompassing a total of eleven rooms, the Psychological Institute, as it became known, eventually moved to a new building that Wundt had designed specifically for psychological research.<ref>Wundt: Das Institut f\u00fcr experimentelle Psychologie, 1909, 118-133.</ref> The list of Wundt's lectures during the winter terms of 1875-1879 shows a wide-ranging programme, 6 days a week, on average 2 hours daily, e.g. in the winter term of 1875: [[Psychology of language]], [[Anthropology]], [[Logic]] and [[Epistemology]]; and during the subsequent summer term: [[Psychology]], Brain and Nerves, as well as [[Physiology]].

He was convinced that, for example, the process of spatial perception could not solely be explained on a physiological level, but also involved psychological principles. Wundt founded [[experimental psychology]] as a discipline and became a pioneer of [[cultural psychology]]. He created a broad research programme in empirical psychology and developed a system of [[philosophy]] and [[ethics]] from the basic concepts of his psychology \u2013 bringing together several disciplines in one person.\n\nWundt's [[epistemological]] position \u2013 against [[John Locke]] and English [[empiricism]] ([[sensualism]]) \u2013 was made clear in his book ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) published in 1862, by his use of a quotation from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] on the title page:\n\n\"Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse.\" (Leibniz, Nouveaux essais, 1765, Livre II, Des Id\u00e9es, Chapitre 1, \u00a7 6).\n\u2013 Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself.\n\nPrinciples that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: [[logical inference]]s, [[Categorization|categories]] of thought, the principle of [[causality]], the principle of [[purpose]] ([[teleology]]), the principle of [[emergence]] and other epistemological principles.\n\nWundt's most important books are:\n\n* ''Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen'' (Textbook of Human Physiology) (1864/1865, 4th ed. 1878);\n* ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' (Principles of Physiological Psychology), (1874; 6th ed. 1908-1911, 3 Vols.);\n* ''System der Philosophie'' (System of Philosophy), (1889; 4th ed. 1919, 2 Vols.);\n* ''Logik. Eine Untersuchung der Prinzipien der Erkenntnis und der Methoden wissenschaftlicher Forschung'' (Logic. An investigation into the principles of knowledge and the methods of scientific research), (1880-1883; 4th ed. 1919-1921, 3 Vols.);\n* ''Ethik'' (Ethics), (1886; 3rd ed. 1903, 2 Vols.);\n* ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Eine Untersuchung der Entwicklungsgesetze von Sprache, Mythos und Sitte'' (Cultural Psychology. An investigation into developmental laws of language, myth, and conduct), (1900-1920, 10 Vols.);\n* ''Grundriss der Psychologie'' (Outline of Psychology), (1896; 14th ed. 1920).\n \nThese 22 volumes cover an immense variety of topics. On examination of the complete works, however, a close relationship between Wundt's theoretical psychology, [[epistemology]] and [[methodology]] can be seen. English translations are only available for the best-known works: ''Principles of physiological Psychology'' (only the single-volume 1st ed. of 1874) and ''Ethics'' (also only 1st ed. of 1886). Wundt's work remains largely inaccessible without advanced knowledge of German. Its reception, therefore, is still greatly hampered by misunderstandings, stereotypes and superficial judgements.<ref>Kurt Danziger(1980): On the threshold of the New Psychology: Situating Wundt and James.

Mental (psychological) phenomena are changing processes of [[consciousness]]. They can only be determined as an [[actuality]], an \"immediate reality of an event in the psychological experience\".<ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, S. 393.</ref> The relationships of consciousness, i.e. the actively organising processes, are no longer explained [[metaphysically]] by means of an [[immortality|immortal]] \u2018[[soul]]\u2019 or an abstract [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] ([[spirituality|spiritual]]) principle.\n\n'''The delineation of categories'''\n\nWundt considered that reference to the subject (Subjektbezug), value assessment (Wertbestimmung), the existence of [[purpose]] (Zwecksetzung), and volitional acts (Willenst\u00e4tigkeit) to be specific and fundamental categories for psychology.<ref>Wundt: Ueber psychische Causalit\u00e4t und das Princip des psycho-physischen Parallelismus, 1894</ref> He frequently used the formulation \"the human as a motivated and thinking subject\" <ref>Wundt: Logik. 1921, Band 3, S. 15\u201319.</ref> in order to characterise features held in common with the [[humanities]] and the categorical difference to the [[natural sciences]].<ref>Fahrenberg: Zur Kategorienlehre der Psychologie, 2013, S. 86\u2013131.</ref>\n\n[[Psychophysical parallelism]]<br />\n \nInfluenced by Leibniz, Wundt introduced the term psychophysical parallelism as follows: \"\u2026 wherever there are regular relationships between mental and physical phenomena the two are neither identical nor convertible into one another because they are per se incomparable; but they are associated with one another in the way that certain mental processes regularly correspond to certain physical processes or, figuratively expressed, run 'parallel to one another'.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Band 3, S. 769.</ref> Although the inner experience is based on the functions of the brain there are no physical causes for mental changes.\n\nLeibniz wrote: \"Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.\" (Monadology, Paragraph 79).<ref>G. W. Leibniz: Die Prinzipien der Philosophie und Monadologie (Les principles de la philosophie ou la monadologie. 1714/1720). In: Thomas Leinkauf (Hrsg.): Leibniz. Eugen Diederichs Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 1996, S. 406\u2013424).</ref>\n\nWundt follows Leibniz and differentiates between a ''physical'' causality (natural causality of [[neurophysiology]]) and a ''mental'' (''psychic'') causality of the consciousness process. Both causalities, however, are not opposites in a dualistic metaphysical sense, but depend on the standpoint <ref>Wundt, 1894; 1897; 1902\u20131903, Volume 3.</ref>  [[Causal explanation]]s in psychology must be content to seek the effects of the antecedent causes without being able to derive exact predictions. Using the example of volitional acts, Wundt describes possible inversion in considering cause and effect, [[ends and means]], and explains how causal and teleological explanations can complement one another to establish a co-ordinated consideration.\n\nWundt's position differed from contemporary authors who also favoured parallelism. Instead of being content with the postulate of parallelism, he developed his principles of ''mental causality'' in contrast to the natural causality of neurophysiology, and a corresponding methodology. There are two fundamentally different approaches of the postulated psychophysical unit, not just two points-of-view in the sense of Gustav Theodor Fechner's [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] hypothesis. Psychological and physiological statements exist in two categorically different [[reference system]]s; the important categories are to be emphasised in order to prevent [[category mistake]]s as discussed by [[Nicolai Hartmann]].<ref>Nicolai Hartmann. Der Aufbau der realen Welt. Grundriss der allgemeinen Kategorienlehre. De Gruyter, Berlin 1940, 2nd ed. 1949, pp.87 ff.)</ref> In this regard, Wundt created the first genuine epistemology and methodology of empirical psychology (the term [[philosophy of science]] did not yet exist).\n\n'''Apperception'''\n\n[[Apperception]] is Wundt's central theoretical concept. Leibniz described apperception as the process in which the elementary sensory impressions pass into [[Self-consciousness|(self-)consciousness]], whereby individual aspirations (striving, volitional acts) play an essential role. Wundt developed psychological concepts, used experimental psychological methods and put forward neuropsychological modelling in the [[frontal cortex]] of the [[brain]] system \u2013 in line with today's thinking. Apperception exhibits a range of theoretical assumptions on the integrative process of consciousness. The selective control of [[attention]] is an elementary example of such active cognitive, emotional and motivational integration.\n\n'''Development theory of the mind'''\n\nThe fundamental task is to work out a comprehensive development theory of the [[mind]] \u2013 from [[animal psychology]] to the highest cultural achievements in language, religion and ethics. Unlike other thinkers of his time, Wundt had no difficulty connecting the development concepts of the humanities (in the spirit of [[Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]) with the biological theory of evolution as expounded by [[Charles Darwin]].\n\n'''Critical realism'''\n\nWundt determined that \"psychology is an empirical science co-ordinating natural science and humanities, and that the considerations of both complement one another in the sense that only together can they create for us a potential empirical knowledge.\" <ref>Wundt: \u00dcber naiven und kritischen Realismus, 1896\u20131898.</ref><ref>Wundt: \u00dcber die Definition der Psychologie, 1896, pp. 21.</ref> He claimed that his views were free of metaphysics and were based on certain epistemological [[presuppositions]], including the differentiation of subject and object in the perception, and the principle of causality.<ref>Wundt: \u00dcber empirische und metaphysische Psychologie, 1904, pp. 336.</ref> With his term ''critical realism'', Wundt distinguishes himself from other philosophical positions.\n\n'''Definition of psychology'''\n\nWundt set himself the task of redefining the broad field of psychology between philosophy and physiology, between the humanities and the natural sciences. In place of the metaphysical definition as a science of the soul came the definition, based on scientific theory, of empirical psychology as a psychology of consciousness with its own categories and epistemological principles. Psychology examines the \"entire experience in its immediately subjective reality.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, 14th ed. p. 14.</ref> The task of psychology is to precisely analyse the processes of consciousness, to assess the complex connections (''psychische Verbindungen''), and to find the laws governing such relationships.\n\n1. Psychology is ''not'' a science of the individual ''soul''. Life is a uniform mental and physical process that can be considered in a variety of ways in order to recognise general principles, particularly the psychological-historical and biological principles of [[Developmental psychology|development]]. Wundt demanded an understanding of the emotional and the volitional functions, in addition to cognitive features, as equally important aspects of the unitary (whole) psychophysical process.\n\n2. Psychology cannot be reduced to physiology. The tools of physiology remain fundamentally insufficient for the task of psychology. Such a project is meaningless \"because the interrelations between mental processes would be incomprehensible even if the interrelations between brain processes were as clearly understood as the mechanism of a pocket watch.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3, S. 777.</ref><br />\n \n3. Psychology is concerned with conscious processes. Wundt rejected making [[subconscious]] mental processes a topic of scientific psychology for epistemological and methodological reasons. In his day there were, before [[Sigmund Freud]], influential authors such as the philosopher [[Eduard von Hartmann]] (1901), who postulated a metaphysics of ''the unconscious''. Wundt had two fundamental objections. He rejected all primarily metaphysically founded psychology and he saw no reliable methodological approach. He also soon revised his initial assumptions about unconscious judgements <ref>Saulo de F. Araujo: Why did Wundt abandon his early theory of the unconscious? 2012, Volume 15, pp. 33\u201349.</ref><ref>Saulo de F. Araujo: Wundt and the Philosophical Foundations of Psychology. A Reappraisal.  2016.</ref> When Wundt rejects the assumption of \"the unconscious\" he is also showing his scepticism regarding Fechner's theory of the unconscious and Wundt is perhaps even more greatly influenced by the flood of writing at the time on [[hypnotism]] and [[spiritualism]] (Wundt, 1879, 1892). While Freud frequently quoted from Wundt's work, Wundt remained sceptical about all hypotheses that operated with the concept of \"the unconscious\".<ref>Christfried T\u00f6gel: Freud und Wundt. Von der Hypnose bis zur V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. In: B. Nitzschke (Ed.). Freud und die akademische Psychologie. Urban & Schwarzenberg: M\u00fcnchen: 1989, pp. 97\u2013105.</ref><ref>Fahrenberg: Theoretische Psychologie, 2015, pp. 310\u2013314.</ref>\n\nFor Wundt it would be just as much a misunderstanding to define psychology as a [[behavioural science]] in the sense of the later concept of strict [[behaviourism]]. Numerous behavioural and psychological variables had already been observed or measured at the Leipzig laboratory. Wundt stressed that physiological effects, for example the physiological changes accompanying [[feelings]], were only tools of psychology, as were the physical measurements of stimulus intensity in [[psychophysics]]. Further developing these methodological approaches one-sidedly would ultimately, however, lead to a behavioural physiology, i.e. a [[scientific reductionism]], and not to a general psychology and cultural psychology.\n\n4. Psychology is an empirical humanities science. Wundt was convinced of the triple status of psychology:\n\n* as a science of the direct experience it contrasts with the natural sciences that refer to the indirect content of experience and abstract from the subject;\n* as a science \"of generally valid forms of direct human experience it is the foundation of the humanities\";\n* among all the empirical sciences it was \"the one whose results most benefit the examination of the general problems of epistemology and ethics \u2013 the two fundamental areas of philosophy.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, 14th ed., pp. 18 f.</ref>\n\nWundt's concepts were developed during almost 60 years of research and teaching that led him from neurophysiology to psychology and philosophy. The interrelationships between physiology, philosophy, logic, epistemology and ethics are therefore essential for an understanding of Wundt's psychology. The core of Wundt's areas of interest and guiding ideas can already be seen in his ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Menschen- und Tierseele'' (Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology) of 1863: ''individual psychology'' (now known as general psychology, i.e. areas such as perception, attention, apperception, volition, will, feelings and emotions); ''cultural psychology'' (Wundt's V\u00f6lkerpsychologie) as development theory of the human mind); ''animal psychology''; and ''neuropsychology''. The initial conceptual outlines of the 30-year-old Wundt (1862, 1863) led to a long research program, to the founding of the first Institute and to the treatment of psychology as a discipline, as well as to a range of fundamental textbooks and numerous other publications.\n\n== Physiology ==\nDuring the Heidelberg years from 1853 to 1873, Wundt published numerous essays on physiology, particularly on experimental neurophysiology, a textbook on human physiology (1865, 4th ed. 1878) and a manual of medical physics (1867). He wrote about 70 reviews of current publications in the fields of neurophysiology and neurology, physiology, anatomy and histology. A second area of work was sensory physiology, including spatial perception, visual perception and optical illusions. \nAn [[optical illusion]] described by him is called the ''[[Wundt illusion]]'', a variant of the [[Hering Illusion]]. It shows how straight lines appear curved when seen against a set of radiating lines.\n\n[[File:Wundt illusion.svg|thumb|right|160px|<center>Wundt illusion</center>]]\n\n== Psychology ==\n\n=== Starting point ===\nAs a result of his medical training and his work as an assistant to Hermann von Helmholtz, Wundt knew the benchmarks of experimental research, as well as the speculative nature of psychology in the mid-19th century. Wundt's aspiration for scientific research and the necessary methodological critique were clear when he wrote of the language of ordinary people, who merely invoked their personal experiences of life, criticized naive introspection, or quoted the influence of uncritical amateur (\"folk\") psychology on psychological interpretation.<ref>Wundt: V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, 1900, Volume 1, p. 15; Wundt: Logik, 1921, Volume 3, p. 297.</ref> \n \nHis ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (1862) shows Wundt's transition from a physiologist to an experimental psychologist. \"Why does not psychology follow the example of the natural sciences? It is an understanding that, from every side of the history of the natural sciences, informs us that the progress of every science is closely connected with the progress made regarding experimental methods.\" <ref>Wundt: Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung, 1862, p. XI.</ref> With this statement, however, he will in no way treat psychology as a pure natural science, though psychologists should learn from the progress of methods in the natural sciences: \"There are two sciences that must come to the aid of general psychology in this regard: the development history of the mind and comparative psychology.\" <ref>Wundt: Beitr\u00e4ge, 1862, p. XVI.</ref>\n\n=== General psychology ===\nThe ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' (''Main Features of Physiological Psychology'') on general psychology is Wundt's best-known textbook. He wanted to connect two sciences with one another. \"Physiology provides information on all phenomena of life that can be perceived using our external senses. In psychology humans examine themselves, as it were, from within and look for the connections between these processes to explain which of them represent this inner observation.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1874, p. 1.</ref>\n\n\"With sufficient certainty the approach can indeed be seen as well-founded \u2013 that nothing takes place in our consciousness that does not have its physical basis in certain physiological processes.\".<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1874, p. 858.</ref>  Wundt believed that physiological psychology had the following task: \"firstly, to investigate those life processes that are centrally located, between external and internal experience, which make it necessary to use both observation methods simultaneously, external and internal, and, secondly, to illuminate and, where possible, determine a total view of human existence from the points of view gained from this investigation.\" \"The attribute \u2018physiological\u2019 is not saying that it ... [physiological psychology] ... wants to reduce the psychology to physiology \u2013 which I consider impossible \u2013 but that it works with physiological, i.e. experimental, tools and, indeed, more so than is usual in other psychology, takes into account the relationship between mental and physical processes.\" \"If one wants to treat the peculiarities of the method as the most important factor then our science \u2013 as experimental psychology \u2013 differs from the usual science of the soul purely based on self-observation.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1874, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> \nAfter long chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, the ''Grundz\u00fcge'' (1874) has five sections: the mental elements, mental structure, interactions of the mental structure, mental developments, the principles and laws of mental causality. Through his insistence that mental processes were analysed in their elements, Wundt did not want to create a pure element psychology because the elements should simultaneously be related to one another. He describes the sensory impression with the simple sensory feelings, perceptions and volitional acts connected with them, and he explains dependencies and feedbacks.\n\nApperception theory\nWundt rejected the widespread [[association theory]], according to which mental connections ([[learning]]) are mainly formed through the frequency and intensity of particular processes. His term ''apperception psychology'' means that he considered the ''creative'' conscious activity to be more important than elementary association. Apperception is an emergent activity that is both arbitrary and selective as well as imaginative and comparative. In this process, feelings and ideas are images apperceptively connected with typical tones of feeling, selected in a variety of ways, analysed, associated and combined, as well as linked with motor and autonomic functions \u2013 not simply ''processed'' but also ''creatively synthesised'' (see below on the Principle of creative synthesis). In the integrative process of conscious activity, Wundt sees an elementary activity of the subject, i.e. an act of volition, to deliberately move content into the conscious. Insofar that this emergent activity is typical of all mental processes, it is possible to describe his point-of-view as voluntaristic.\n\nWundt describes apperceptive processes as psychologically highly differentiated and, in many regards, bases this on methods and results from his experimental research. One example is the wide-ranging series of experiments on the [[mental chronometry]] of complex [[reaction time]]s. In research on feelings, certain effects are provoked while pulse and breathing are recorded using a [[kymograph]]. The observed differences were intended to contribute towards supporting Wundt's [[Emotion theory|theory of emotions]] with its three dimensions: pleasant \u2013 unpleasant, tense \u2013 relaxed, excited \u2013 depressed.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902, Volume 2, pp. 263-369.</ref>\n\n=== Cultural psychology ===\nWilhelm Wundt's ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Eine Untersuchung der Entwicklungsgesetze von Sprache, Mythus und Sitte'' (''Social Psychology. An Investigation of the Laws of Evolution of Language, Myth, and Custom'', 1900-1920, 10 Vols.) which also contains the evolution of [[Arts]], [[Law]], [[Society]], [[Culture]] and ''History'', is a milestone project, a monument of [[cultural psychology]], of the early 20th century. The dynamics of cultural development were investigated according to psychological and epistemological principles. Psychological principles were derived from Wundt's psychology of apperception (theory of higher integrative processes, including association, [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[semantic change]]) and [[motivation]] (will), as presented in his ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' (1908-1910, 6th ed., 3 Vols.). In contrast to individual psychology, cultural psychology aims to illustrate general mental development laws governing higher intellectual processes: the development of thought, language, artistic imagination, myths, religion, customs, the relationship of individuals to society, the intellectual environment and the creation of intellectual works in a society. \"Where deliberate experimentation ends is where history has experimented on the behalf of psychologists.\" <ref>Wundt, 1863, p. IX.</ref> Those mental processes that \"underpin the general development of human societies and the creation of joint intellectual results that are of generally recognised value\" <ref>Wundt V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, 1911, 3rd ed. Vol. 1, p. 1.</ref> are to be examined.\n\nStimulated by the ideas of previous thinkers, such as [[Herder]], [[Herbart]], [[Hegel]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (with his ideas about comparative [[linguistics]]), the psychologist [[Moritz Lazarus]] (1851) and the [[linguist]] [[Heymann Steinthal]] founded the ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' (Journal for Cultural Psychology and Linguistics) in 1860, which gave this field its name. Wundt (1888) critically analysed the, in his view, still disorganised intentions of Lazarus and Steinthal and limited the scope of the issues by proposing a psychologically constituted structure. The cultural psychology of language, myth, and customs were to be based on the three main areas of general psychology: imagining and thought, feelings, and will (motivation). The numerous mental interrelations and principles were to be researched under the perspective of cultural development. Apperception theory applied equally for general psychology and cultural psychology. Changes in meanings and motives were examined in many lines of development, and there are detailed interpretations based on the emergence principle (creative synthesis), the principle of unintended side-effects (heterogony of ends) and the principle of contrast (see section on ''Methodology and Strategies'').\n\nThe ten volumes consist of: Language (Vols. 1 and 2), Art (Vol. 3), Myths and Religion (Vols. 4 - 6), Society (Vols. 7 and 8), Law (Vol. 9), as well as Culture and History (Vol. 10). The methodology of cultural psychology was mainly described later, in ''Logik'' (1921). Wundt worked on, psychologically linked, and structured an immense amount of material. The topics range from agriculture and trade, crafts and property, through gods, myths and Christianity, marriage and family, peoples and nations to (self-)education and self-awareness, science, the world and humanity.\n\nWundt recognized about 20 ''fundamental dynamic motives in cultural development''. Motives frequently quoted in cultural development are: division of labour, ensoulment, salvation, happiness, production and imitation, child-raising, artistic drive, welfare, arts and magic, adornment, guilt, punishment, atonement, self-education, play, and revenge. Other values and motives emerge in the areas of freedom and justice, war and peace, legal structures, state structures and forms of government; also regarding the development of a world view of culture, religion, state, traffic, and a worldwide political and social society. In religious considerations, many of the values and motives (i.e. belief in soul, immortality, belief in gods and demons, ritualistic acts, witchcraft, animism and totemism) are combined with the motives of art, imagination, dance and ecstasy, as well as with forms of family and power.\n\nWundt saw examples of human [[self-education]] in walking upright, physical facilities and \"an interaction in part forced upon people by external conditions and in part the result of voluntary culture\".<ref>Wundt, V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Vol. 10, p. 189.</ref> He described the random appearance and later conscious control of fire as a similar interaction between two motives. In the interaction of human activity and the conditions of nature he saw a creative principle of culture right from the start; tools as cultural products of a second nature. An interactive system of cause and effect, a system of purposes and thus values (and reflexively from standards of one's own activities) is formed according to the principles of one's own thinking.<ref>Wundt, V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Vol. 10, p. 195.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Elemente der V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' (The Elements of Cultural Psychology, 1912) Wundt sketched out four main levels of cultural development: primitive man, the totemistic age, the age of heroes and gods, and the development of humanity. The delineations were unclear and the depiction was greatly simplified. Only this book was translated into English ''Elements of folk-psychology'' <ref>Tr. Schaub, E.L. Allen, London 1916.</ref>), thus providing but a much abridged insight into Wundt's differentiated cultural psychology. (The [[Folk Psychology]] part of the title already demonstrates the low level of understanding).\n\nIn retrospect, \u2018V\u00f6lkerpsychologie\u2019 was an unfortunate choice of title because it is often misinterpreted as [[ethnology]]. Wundt also considered calling it (Social) [[Anthropology]], [[Social Psychology]] and [[Community Psychology]]. The term ''Kulturpsychologie'' would have been more fitting though ''psychological development theory of the mind'' would have expressed Wundt's intentions even better.<ref>Fahrenberg: Wilhelm Wundts Kulturpsychologie (V\u00f6lkerpsychologie), 2016b.</ref> The intellectual potential and heuristics of Wundt's Cultural Psychology are by no means exhausted.\n\n=== Neuropsychology ===\nWundt contributed to the state of [[neuropsychology]] as it existed at the time in three ways: through his criticism of the theory of localisation (then widespread in [[neurology]]), through his demand for research hypotheses founded on both neurological and psychological thinking, and through his neuropsychological concept of an apperception centre in the [[frontal cortex]]. Wundt considered [[attention]] and the control of attention an excellent example of the desirable combination of experimental psychological and neurophysiological research. Wundt called for experimentation to localise the higher central nervous functions to be based on clear, psychologically-based research hypotheses because the questions could not be rendered precisely enough on the anatomical and physiological levels alone.\n [[File:Apperzeptionszentrum (Wundt, Grundz\u00fcge, 1903, 5th ed. Vol. 1, p. 324).jpg|thumb|<center>(Wundt, ''Grundz\u00fcge'', 1903, 5th ed. Vol. 1, p. 324.)</center>]]\nWundt based his central theory of apperception on neuropsychological modelling (from the 3rd edition of the ''Grundz\u00fcge'' onwards). According to this, the hypothetical apperception centre in the frontal cerebral cortex that he described could interconnect sensory, motor, autonomic, cognitive, emotional and motivational process components <ref>Ziche: Neuroscience in its context, 1999.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fahrenberg: Wundts Neuropsychologie, 2015b.</ref> Wundt thus provided the guiding principle of a primarily psychologically-oriented research programme on the highest integrative processes. He is therefore a forerunner of current research on cognitive and emotional [[executive functions]] in the prefrontal cerebral cortex, and on hypothetical ''multimodal convergence zones'' in the network of cortical and limbic functions. This concept of an interdisciplinary [[neuroscience]] is now taken for granted, but Wundt's contribution towards this development has almost been forgotten. [[Charles Scott Sherrington|C.S. Sherrington]] repeatedly quotes Wundt's research on the physiology of the [[reflexes]] in his textbook,<ref>Ch. S. Sherrington: The integrative Action of the Nervous System. Henry Frowde, London 1911.</ref> but not Wundt's neuropsychological concepts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Methodology and strategies ==\n\"Given its position between the natural sciences and the humanities, psychology really does have a great wealth of methodological tools. While, on the one hand, there are the experimental methods, on the other hand, objective works and products in cultural development (''Objektivationen des menschlichen Geistes'') also offer up abundant material for comparative psychological analysis\".<ref>Wundt: Logik, 1921, 4th ed., Volume 3, p. 51.</ref>\n\nPsychology is an empirical science and must endeavor to achieve a systematic procedure, examination of results, and criticism of its methodology. Thus [[self-observation]] must be trained and is only permissible under strict experimental control; Wundt decisively rejects naive [[introspection]]. Wundt provided a standard definition of psychological experiments.<ref>Wundt, 1907, 1908, 1921.</ref> His dispute with [[Immanuel Kant]] (Wundt, 1874) had a major influence. Kant had argued against the assumption of the measurability of conscious processes and made a well-founded, if very short, criticism of the methods of self-observation: regarding method-inherent reactivity, observer error, distorting attitudes of the subject, and the questionable influence of ''independently thinking people'',<ref>Immanuel Kant: Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. Schriften zur Anthropologie, Geschichtsphilosophie, Politik und P\u00e4dagogik. (Immanuel Kant Werkausgabe. Band 6). hrsg. von Wilhelm Weischedel. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1798/1983, pp. 395\u2013690.</ref> but Wundt expressed himself optimistic that methodological improvements could be of help here.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge 1874, pp. 5-8.</ref> He later admitted that [[measurement]] and mathematics were only applicable for very elementary conscious processes. [[Statistical methods]] were also of only limited value, for example in psychophysics or in the evaluation of [[population statistics]].<ref>Fahrenberg: Theoretische Psychologie, 2015a, pp. 115-126; pp. 228-234.</ref>\n\nExperimental psychology in Leipzig mainly lent on four methodological types of assessment: the ''impression methods'' with their various measurement techniques in psychophysics; the ''reaction methods'' for chronometry in the psychology of apperception; the ''reproduction methods'' in research on memory, and the ''expression methods'' with observations and psychophysiological measurement in research on feelings.<ref>Wundt. Grundz\u00fcge, 1908-1910.</ref><ref>Wontorra, 2009.</ref> Wundt considered the methodology of his linguistic psychological investigations (Vols. 1 and 2 of V\u00f6lkerpsychologie) to be the most fruitful path to adequate psychological research on the thought process.\n\nThe principles of his cultural psychological methodology were only worked out later. These involved the analytical and comparative observation of objective existing materials, i.e. historical writings, language, works, art, reports and observations of human behaviour in earlier cultures and, more rarely, direct ethnological source material. Wundt differentiated between two objectives of comparative methodology: individual comparison collected all the important features of the overall picture of an observation material, while generic comparison formed a picture of variations to obtain a typology. Rules of generic comparison and critical interpretation are essentially explained in his Logik:<ref>Wundt, 1921, pp. 62 ff, 238 f; 1920a, p. 372.)</ref>\n\n\"We therefore generally describe the epitome of the methods as interpretation that is intended to provide us with an understanding of mental processes and intellectual creation.\" Wundt clearly referred to the tradition of humanistic [[hermeneutics]], but argued that the interpretation process basically also followed psychological principles. Interpretation only became the characteristic process of the humanities through criticism. It is a process that is set against interpretation to dismantle the interaction produced through psychological analysis. It examines external or internal contradictions, it should evaluate the reality of intellectual products, and is also a criticism of values and a criticism of opinions. The typical misconceptions of the intellectualistic, individualistic and unhistorical interpretation of intellectual processes all have \"their source in the habitually coarse psychology based on subjective assessment.\" <ref>Wundt: Logik, 1921, 4th ed., Volume 3, p. 297.</ref>\n\n=== Principles of mental causality ===\nWhat is meant by these principles is ''the simple prerequisites of the linking of psychological facts that cannot be further extrapolated''. The system of principles has several repeatedly reworked versions, with corresponding laws of development for cultural psychology (Wundt, 1874, 1894, 1897, 1902\u20131903, 1920, 1921). Wundt mainly differentiated between four principles and explained them with examples that originate from the physiology of perception, the psychology of meaning, from apperception research, emotion and motivation theory, and from cultural psychology and ethics.\n\n(1) ''The Principle of [[creative synthesis]] or creative results'' (the emergence principle). \"Every perception can be broken down into elemental impressions. But it is never just the sum of these impressions, but from the linkage of them that a new one is created with individual features that were not contained in the impressions themselves. We thus put together the mental picture of a spatial form from a multitude of impressions of light. This principle proves itself in all mental causality linkages and accompanies mental development from its first to its consummate stage.\" Wundt formulated this creative synthesis, which today would also be described as the principle of emergence in [[system theory]], as an essential epistemological principle of empirical psychology \u2013 long before the phrase ''the whole is more than the sum of its parts'' or supra-summation was used in [[gestalt psychology]].<ref>Wundt: Vorlesungen \u00fcber Menschen- und Tierseele, 1863, Volume 1, p. 435 f.</ref><ref>Wundt: Erlebtes und Erkanntes, 1920, p. 183.</ref>\n\n(2) ''The Principle of relational analysis'' (context principle). This principle says that \"every individual mental content receives its meaning through the relationships in which it stands to other mental content.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, p. 401.</ref>\n\n(3) ''The Principle of mental contrasts or reinforcement of opposites or development in dichotomies.'' Typical contrast effects are to be seen in sensory perceptions, in the course of emotions and in volitional processes. There is a general tendency to order the subjective world according to opposites. Thus many individual, historical, economic and social processes exhibit highly contrasting developments.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3, S. 785.</ref>\n\n(4) ''The Principle of the [[heterogony]] of purpose (ends).'' The consequences of an action extend beyond the original intended purpose and give rise to new motives with new effects. The intended purpose always induces [[side-effects]] and knock-on effects that themselves become purposes, i.e. an ever-growing organisation through self-creation.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3, p. 789.</ref> \n \nIn addition to these four principles, Wundt explained the term of intellectual community and other categories and principles that have an important relational and insightful function.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3.</ref>\n\nWundt demands co-ordinated analysis of causal and teleological aspects; he called for a methodologically versatile psychology and did not demand that any decision be made between experimental-statistical methods and interpretative methods ([[qualitative methods]]). Whenever appropriate, he referred to findings from interpretation and experimental research within a [[multimethod]] approach. Thus, for example, the chapters on the development of language or on enlargement of fantasy activity in cultural psychology also contain experimental, statistical and psychophysiological findings.<ref>Meischner-Metge: Die Methode der Forschung, 2006, pp. 131-143.</ref><ref>Fahrenberg, 2016b.</ref> He was very familiar with these methods and used them in extended research projects. This was without precedent and has, since then, rarely been achieved by another individual researcher.\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== Wundt's philosophical orientation ===\nIn the introduction to his ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' in 1874, Wundt described [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] as the philosophers who had the most influence on the formation of his own views. Those who follow up these references will find that Wundt critically analysed both these thinkers\u2019 ideas. He distanced himself from Herbart's science of the soul and, in particular, from his \"mechanism of mental representations\" and pseudo-mathematical speculations.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge,1874, Chapter 19.</ref>  While Wundt praised Kant's critical work and his rejection of a \"rational\" psychology deduced from metaphysics, he argued against Kant's epistemology in his publication ''Was soll uns Kant nicht sein?'' (What Kant should we reject?) 1892 with regard to the forms of perception and presuppositions, as well as Kant's category theory and his position in the dispute on causal and teleological explanations.\n\n[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] had a far greater and more constructive influence on Wundt's psychology, philosophy, epistemology and ethics. This can be gleaned from Wundt's Leibniz publication (1917) and from his central terms and principles, but has since received almost no attention.<ref>Fahrenberg, 2016a.</ref> Wundt gave up his plans for a biography of Leibniz, but praised Leibniz's thinking on the two-hundredth anniversary of his death in 1916. He did, however, disagree with Leibniz's [[monadology]] as well as theories on the mathematisation of the world by removing the domain of the mind from this view. Leibniz developed a new concept of the soul through his discussion on substance and [[actuality]], on dynamic spiritual change, and on the correspondence between body and soul ([[Psychophysical parallelism|parallelism]]). Wundt ''secularised'' such guiding principles and reformulated important philosophical positions of Leibniz away from belief in God as the creator and belief in an immortal soul. Wundt gained important ideas and exploited them in an original way in his principles and methodology of empirical psychology: the principle of actuality, psychophysical parallelism, combination of causal and teleological analysis, apperception theory, the psychology of ''striving'', i.e. volition and voluntary tendency, principles of epistemology and the perspectivism of thought. Wundt's differentiation between the \"natural causality\" of neurophysiology and the \"mental causality\" of psychology (the intellect), is a direct rendering from Leibniz's epistemology.<ref>Fahrenberg 2016a.</ref>\n\nWundt devised the term [[psychophysical parallelism]] and meant thereby two fundamentally different ways of considering the postulated psychophysical unit, not just two views in the sense of Fechner's theory of identity. Wundt derived the co-ordinated consideration of natural causality and mental causality from Leibniz's differentiation between causality and teleology ([[principle of sufficient reason]]). The psychological and physiological statements exist in two categorically different [[reference system]]s; the main categories are to be emphasised in order to prevent [[category mistake]]s. With his epistemology of mental causality, he differed from contemporary authors who also advocated the position of parallelism. Wundt had developed the first genuine epistemology and methodology of empirical psychology.\n\nWundt shaped the term apperception, introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling. When Leibniz differentiates between two fundamental functions, perception and striving, this approach can be recognised in Wundt's motivation theory. The central theme of \"unity in the manifold\" (unitas in multitudine) also originates from Leibniz, who has influenced the current understanding of [[perspectivism]] and viewpoint dependency.<ref>Fahrenberg: Zur Kategorienlehre, 2013, S. 288\u2013296.</ref> Wundt characterised this style of thought in a way that also applied for him: \"\u2026the principle of the equality of viewpoints that supplement one another\" plays a significant role in his thinking \u2013 viewpoints that \"supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply.\" <ref>Wundt: Leibniz, 1917, S.117.</ref>\n\nUnlike the great majority of contemporary and current authors in psychology, Wundt laid out the philosophical and methodological positions of his work clearly. Wundt was against the founding empirical psychology on a (metaphysical or structural) principle of soul as in Christian belief in an [[immortal soul]] or in a philosophy that argues \"substance\"-[[ontologically]]. Wundt's position was decisively rejected by several Christianity-oriented psychologists and philosophers as a ''psychology without soul'', although he did not use this formulation from Friedrich Lange (1866), who was his predecessor in Z\u00fcrich from 1870 to 1872. Wundt's guiding principle was the development theory of the mind. Wundt's ethics also led to polemical critiques due to his renunciation of an ultimate transcendental basis of ethics (God, the Absolute). Wundt's [[evolutionism]] was also criticised for its claim that ethical norms had been culturally changed in the course of human intellectual development.<ref>reception analysis, see Fahrenberg 2011, 2015a.</ref>\n\nWundt's autobiography <ref>Wundt: Erlebtes und Erkanntes, 1920</ref> and his inaugural lectures in Zurich and Leipzig <ref>Wundt, 1874; Wundt, 1875.</ref> as well as his commemorative speeches for Fechner <ref>Wundt, 1901.</ref> and his Essay on Leibniz <ref>Wundt, 1917</ref> provide an insight into the history of Wundt's education and the contemporary flows and intellectual controversies in the second half of the 19th century. Wundt primarily refers to Leibniz and Kant, more indirectly to [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]; and to [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]],  [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] regarding psychology. In addition to [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[David Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], one finds [[Francis Bacon]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Charles A. Spencer|Charles Spencer]], as well as French thinkers such as [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Hippolyte Taine]], all of whom are more rarely quoted by Wundt.<ref>Araoujo, 2016; Fahrenberg, 2016a.</ref>\n\n=== Metaphysics ===\n\nWundt distanced himself from the metaphysical term soul and from theories about its structure and properties, as posited by Herbart, Lotze and Fechner. Wundt followed Kant and warned against a primarily metaphysically founded, philosophically deduced psychology: \"where one notices the author's metaphysical point-of-view in the treatment of every problem then an unconditional empirical science is no longer involved \u2013 but a metaphysical theory intended to serve as an exemplification of experience.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1896, p. 22.</ref> \nHe is, however, convinced that every single science contains general prerequisites of a philosophical nature. \"All psychological investigation extrapolates from metaphysical presuppositions.\" <ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1919, Volume 1, pp. IX f.</ref>  Epistemology was to help sciences find out about, clarify or supplement their metaphysical aspects and as far as possible free themselves of them. Psychology and the other sciences always rely on the help of philosophy here, and particularly on logic and epistemology, otherwise only an immanent philosophy, i.e. metaphysical assumptions of an unsystematic nature, would form in the individual sciences <ref>Wundt, System der Philosophie, 1897, p. 33.</ref>  Wundt is decidedly against the segregation of philosophy. He is concerned about psychologists bringing their own personal metaphysical convictions into psychology and that these presumptions would no longer be exposed to epistemological criticism. \"Therefore nobody would suffer more from such a segregation than the psychologists themselves and, through them, psychology.\" <ref>Wundt: Die Psychologie im Kampf ums Dasein. 1913, p. 24.</ref> \"Nothing would promote the degeneration [of psychology] to a mere craftsmanship more than its segregation from philosophy.\" <ref>Wundt: Die Psychologie im Kampf ums Dasein. 1913, p. 37.</ref>\n\n=== System of philosophy ===\nWundt claimed that philosophy as a general science has the task of \"uniting to become a consistent system through the general knowledge acquired via the individual sciences.\" Human rationality strives for a uniform, i.e. non-contradictory, explanatory principle for being and consciousness, for an ultimate reasoning for ethics, and for a philosophical world basis. \"Metaphysics is the same attempt to gain a binding world view, as a component of individual knowledge, on the basis of the entire scientific awareness of an age or particularly prominent content.\" <ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1919, Volume 1, p. 17.</ref> Wundt was convinced that empirical psychology also contributed fundamental knowledge on the understanding of humans \u2013 for anthropology and ethics \u2013 beyond its narrow scientific field. Starting from the active and creative-synthetic apperception processes of consciousness, Wundt considered that the unifying function was to be found in volitional processes and the conscious setting of objectives and subsequent activities. \"There is simply nothing more to a man that he can entirely call his own \u2013 except for his will.\" <ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1897, p. 377.</ref> One can detect a \"voluntaristic tendency\" in Wundt's theory of motivation, in contrast to the currently widespread cognitivism ([[intellectualism]]). Wundt extrapolated this empirically founded volitional psychology to a [[metaphysical voluntarism]]. He demands, however, that the empirical-psychological and derived metaphysical voluntarism are kept apart from one another and firmly maintained that his empirical psychology was created independently of the various teachings of metaphysics.<ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1919, Volume 1, p. IX f.</ref>\n\nWundt interpreted intellectual-cultural progress and biological evolution as a general process of development whereby, however, he did not want to follow the abstract ideas of [[entelechy]], [[vitalism]], [[animism]], and by no means [[Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] volitional metaphysics. He believed that the source of dynamic development was to be found in the most elementary expressions of life, in reflexive and instinctive behaviour, and constructed a continuum of attentive and apperceptive processes, volitional or selective acts, up to social activities and ethical decisions. At the end of this rational idea he recognised a practical ideal: the idea of humanity as the highest yardstick of our actions and that the overall course of human history can be understood with regard to the ideal of humanity.<ref>Wundt: Ethik, 1886, p. 577.</ref>\n[[File:Portraitb\u00fcste 0686-90 F22838.jpg|thumb|<center>Wilhelm Wundt portrait bust by Max Klinger 1908</center>]]\n\n=== Ethics ===\nParallel to Wundt's work on cultural psychology he wrote his much-read ''Ethik'' (1886, 3rd ed. in 2 Vols., 1903), whose introduction stressed how important development considerations are in order to grasp [[religion]], [[customs]] and [[morality]]. Wundt considered the questions of ethics to be closely linked with the empirical psychology of motivated acts <ref>(Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Vol. 3.</ref> \"Psychology has been such an important introduction for me, and such an indispensable aid for the investigation of ethics, that I do not understand how one could do without it.\" <ref>Wundt: Ethik, 1886, Vorwort p. III.</ref> Wundt sees two paths: the anthropological examination of the facts of a moral life (in the sense of cultural psychology) and the scientific reflection on the concepts of morals. The derived principles are to be examined in a variety of areas: the family, society, the state, education, etc. In his discussion on [[free will]] (as an attempt to mediate between [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]]) he categorically distinguishes between two perspectives: there is indeed a natural causality of brain processes, though conscious processes are not determined by an intelligible, but by the empirical character of humans \u2013 volitional acts are subject to the principles of mental causality. \"When a man only follows inner causality he acts freely in an ethical sense, which is partly determined by his original disposition and partly by the development of his character.\"<ref>Wundt: Ethik, 1886, p. 410.</ref>\n\nOn the one hand, Ethics is a normative discipline while, on the other hand, these \u2018rules\u2019 change, as can be seen from the empirical examination of culture-related [[morality]]. Wundt's ethics can, put simply, be interpreted as an attempt to mediate between Kant's [[apriorism]] and [[empiricism]]. Moral rules are the legislative results of a universal intellectual development, but are neither rigidly defined nor do they simply follow changing life conditions. [[Individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]] are strictly rejected. In his view, only the universal intellectual life can be considered to be an [[end in itself]]. Wundt also spoke on the idea of humanity in ethics, on [[human rights]] and [[human duties]] in his speech as Rector of Leipzig University in 1889 on the centenary of the [[French Revolution]].\n\n=== Logic, epistemology and the scientific theory of psychology ===\nWundt divided up his three-volume ''Logik'' into General logic and epistemology, Logic of the exact sciences, and Logic of the humanities. While logic, the doctrine of categories, and other principles were discussed by Wundt in a traditional manner, they were also considered from the point of view of development theory of the human intellect, i.e. in accordance with the psychology of thought. The subsequent equitable description of the special principles of the natural sciences and the humanities enabled Wundt to create a new epistemology. The ideas that remain current include epistemology and the methodology of psychology: the tasks and directions of psychology, the methods of interpretation and comparison, as well as psychological experimentation.\n\n== Complete works and legacy ==\n\n=== Publications, libraries and letters ===\n[[File:Wundt-Plakette Leipzig.tif|thumb|<center>Wilhelm Wundt commemorative plaque, University of Leipzig</center>]]\nThe list of works at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]] includes a total of 589 German and foreign-language editions for the period from 1853 to 1950 MPI f\u00fcr Wissenschaftsgeschichte: ''Werkverzeichnis Wilhelm Wundt''.The American psychologist Edwin Boring counted 494 publications by Wundt (excluding pure reprints but with revised editions) that are, on average, 110 pages long and amount to a total of 53,735 pages. Thus Wundt published an average of seven works per year over a period of 68 years and wrote or revised an average of 2.2 pages per day.<ref>Boring: A history of experimental psychology (2nd ed.), 1950, p. 345.</ref> There is as yet no annotated edition of the essential writings, nor does a complete edition of Wundt's major works exist, apart from more-or-less suitable scans or digitalisations.\n\nApart from his library and his correspondence, Wundt's extraordinarily extensive written inheritance also includes many extracts, manuscripts, lecture notes and other materials <ref>Fahrenberg, 2016; Meyer, 2015; Ungerer, 2016.</ref> Wundt's written inheritance in Leipzig consists of 5,576 documents, mainly letters, and was digitalised by the Leipzig University Library. The catalogue is available at the ''Kalliope online portal''.\n\nOne-third of Wundt's own library was left to his children Eleonore and Max Wundt; most of the works were sold during the times of need after the First World War to [[Tohoku University]] in Sendai, Japan. The University's stock consists of 6,762 volumes in western languages (including bound periodicals) as well as 9,098 special print runs and brochures from the original Wundt Library.<ref>M.

[[T\u00fcbingen University]] Archive's stock includes copies of 613 letters, Wundt's will, lists from Wundt's original library, and other materials and \u2018Wundtiana\u2019:<ref>Inventory UAT 228 with inventory lists UAT 228/16 to 228/24.</ref>  The [[German Historical Museum]] in Berlin has a 1918 shellac disk on which Wundt repeats the closing words of his inaugural lecture (given in Z\u00fcrich on 31 October 1874 and re-read in 1918 for documentation purposes): \"On the task of philosophy in the present\" <ref>Signature T90/447, length of recording is 2 minutes.</ref>\n\n===Biographies ===\nThe last Wundt biography which tried to represent both Wundt's psychology and his philosophy was by Eisler (1902). One can also get an idea of Wundt's thoughts from his autobiography ''Erlebtes und Erkanntes'' (1920). Later biographies by Nef (1923) and Petersen (1925) up to Arnold in 1980 restrict themselves primarily to the psychology ''or'' the philosophy. Eleonore Wundt's (1928) knowledgeable but short biography of her father exceeds many others\u2019 efforts.\n\n=== Political attitude ===\nAt the start of the First World War, Wundt, like [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Max Planck]], signed the patriotic call to arms as did about 4,000 professors and lecturers in Germany, and during the following years he wrote several political speeches and essays that were also characterized by the feeling of a superiority of German science and culture. Wundt was a Liberal during his early Heidelberg time, affiliated with a Workers\u2019 Education Union (Arbeiterbildungsverein), and as a politician in the [[Baden]] State Parliament (see also his speech as Rector of Leipzig University in 1889). In old age he appeared to become more conservative (see Wundt, 1920; Wundt's correspondence), then \u2013 also in response to the war, the subsequent social unrest and the severe revolutionary events of the post-war period \u2013 adopted an attitude that was patriotic and lent towards nationalism. Wilhelm Wundt's son, philosopher Max Wundt, had an even more clearly intense, somewhat nationalist, stance. While he was not a member of the [[Nazi party]] (NSDAP), he wrote about national traditions and race in philosophical thinking.<ref>Mark Michalski: Der Gang des deutschen Denkens. K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann, W\u00fcrzburg 2010.</ref>\n\n===Wundt Societies ===\nFour ''Wilhelm Wundt Societies'' or Associations have been founded:\n\n* 1925 to 1968: ''Wilhelm Wundt Stiftung und Verband Freunde des Psychologischen Instituts der Universit\u00e4t Leipzig'', founded by former assistants and friends of Wundts.   \n* 1979: ''[http://www.wilhelm-wundt-gesellschaft.de Wilhelm Wundt Gesellschaft]'' (based in Heidelberg), \"a scientific association with a limited number of members set up with the aim of promoting fundamental psychological research and further developing it through its efforts.\" \n* 1992 to 1996: ''Wundt-Stiftung e.V. und F\u00f6rderverein Wundt-Stiftung e.V.'' (based in Bonn/Leipzig). \n* 2016: ''F\u00f6rderverein Wilhelm-Wundt-Haus in Grossbothen.''. The purpose of the association is \"the maintenance and restoration of the Wundt home in keeping with its listed building status, as well as its appropriate use\". The association was founded on the initiative of J\u00fcttemann (2014).\n\nDie ''Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie'' [[German Society for Psychology]] grants a Wilhelm-Wundt-Medaille.\n\n== Reception of Wundt's work ==\n\n=== Reception by his contemporaries ===\nThe psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] described the pioneering spirit at the new Leipzig Institute in this fashion: \"We felt that we were trailblazers entering virgin territory, like creators of a science with undreamt-of prospects. Wundt spent several afternoons every week in his adjacent modest Professorial office, came to see us, advised us and often got involved in the experiments; he was also available to us at any time.\" <ref>Emil Kraepelin: Nachruf Wilhelm Wundt. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie 1920, Volume 61, 351-362.</ref>\n\nThe philosopher [[Rudolf Eisler]] considered Wundt's approach as follows: \"A major advantage of Wundt's philosophy is that it neither consciously nor unconsciously takes metaphysics back to its beginnings, but strictly distinguishes between empirical-scientific and epistemological-metaphysical approaches, and considers each point-of-view in isolation in its relative legitimacy before finally producing a uniform world view. Wundt always differentiates between the physical-physiological and the purely psychological, and then again from the philosophical point-of-view. As a result, apparent \u2018contradictions\u2019 are created for those who do not observe more precisely and who constantly forget that the differences in results are only due to the approach and not the laws of reality ...\" <ref>Rudolf Eisler: W. Wundts Philosophie und Psychologie, 1902, p. 13.</ref> Traugott Oesterreich (1923/1951) wrote an unusually detailed description of Wundt's work in his Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie (Foundations of the History of Philosophy). This knowledgeable representation examines Wundt's main topics, views and scientific activities and exceeds the generally much briefer Wundt reception within the field of psychology, in which many of the important prerequisites and references are ignored right from the start.\n\nThe internal consistency of Wundt's work from 1862 to 1920, between the main works and within the reworked editions, has repeatedly been discussed and been subject to differing assessments in parts.<ref>Araujo, 2016; Fahrenberg, 2011, 2015, 2016; Graumann, 1980; J\u00fcttemann 2006.</ref>  One could not say that the scientific conception of psychology underwent a fundamental revision of principal ideas and central postulates, though there was gradual development and a change in emphasis. One could consider Wundt's gradual concurrence with Kant's position, that conscious processes are not measurable on the basis of self-observation and cannot be mathematically formulated, to be a major divergence. Wundt, however, never claimed that psychology could be advanced through experiment and measurement alone, but had already stressed in 1862 that the development history of the mind and comparative psychology should provide some assistance.<ref>Wundt: Beitr\u00e4ge, 1862, p. XIV.</ref>\n\nWundt attempted to redefine and restructure the fields of psychology and philosophy.\n<ref>Fahrenberg: Wilhelm Wundt, 2011, S. 14\u201316.</ref><ref>Paul Ziche: Wissenschaftslandschaften um 1900: Philosophie, die Wissenschaften und der nichtreduktive Szientismus, 2008.</ref> \"Experimental psychology in the narrower sense and child psychology form individual psychology, while cultural and animal psychology are both parts of a general and comparative psychology\" <ref>Wundt 1902, p. 6.</ref>). None of his Leipzig assistants and hardly any textbook authors in the subsequent two generations have adopted Wundt's broad theoretical horizon, his demanding scientific theory or the multi-method approach. [[Oswald K\u00fclpe]] had already ruled cultural and animal psychology out.<ref>K\u00fclpe, 1893, p. 7ff.</ref>\n\nWhile the ''Principles of physiological Psychology'' met with worldwide resonance, Wundt's cultural psychology (ethno-psychology) appeared to have had a less widespread impact. But there are indications that [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Franz Boas]], among others, were influenced by it.<ref>Eckardt, 1997; Graumann, 2006.</ref> In his [[Totem and Taboo]], [[Sigmund Freud]] frequently quoted Wundt's cultural psychology. In its time, Wundt's Ethik received more reviews than almost any of his other main works. Most of the objections were ranged against his renouncing any ultimate transcendental ethical basis (God, the Absolute), as well as against his ideas regarding evolution, i.e. that ethical standards changed culturally in the course of human intellectual development. As Wundt did not describe any concrete ethical conflicts on the basis of examples and did not describe any social ethics in particular, his teachings with the general idea of humanism appear rather too abstract.\n\nThe ''XXII International Congress for Psychology in Leipzig in 1980'', i.e. on the hundredth jubilee of the initial founding of the Institute in 1879, stimulated a number of publications about Wundt, also in the US <ref>Wolfgang G. Bringmann, Ryan D. Tweney (Eds.): Wundt studies, 1980; Wolfgang G. Bringmann, Eckart Scheerer (Eds.): Wundt centennial issue, 1980, Volume 42, pp. 1\u2013189; Robert W. Rieber, David K. Robinson (Eds.): Wilhelm Wundt in history: The making of a scientific psychology, 2001.</ref> Very little productive research work has been carried out since then. While Wundt was occasionally mentioned in the centenary review of the founding of the ''German Society for Experimental Psychology'' 1904/2004, it was without the principal ideas of his psychology and philosophy of science.<ref>Thomas Rammsayer, Stefan Troche (Eds.): Reflexionen der Psychologie. 100 Jahre Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie. Bericht \u00fcber den 44. Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie in G\u00f6ttingen 2004. Hogrefe: G\u00f6ttingen 2005.</ref>\n\n=== Research on reception of his work ===\nLeipzig was a world-famous centre for the new psychology after 1874. There are various interpretations regarding why Wundt's influence after the turn of the century, i.e. during his lifetime, rapidly waned and from his position as founding father Wundt became almost an outsider. A survey was conducted on the basis of more than 200 contemporary and later sources: reviews and critiques of his publications (since 1858), references to Wundt's work in textbooks on psychology and the history of psychology (from 1883 to 2010), biographies, congress reports, praise on his decadal birthdays, obituaries and other texts. A range of scientific controversies were presented in detail.<ref name=\"Fahrenberg 2011\"/> Reasons for the distancing of Wundt and why some of his concepts have fallen into oblivion can be seen in his scientific work, in his philosophical orientation, in his didactics or in the person of Wundt himself:\n\n*Possibly the most important reason for Wundt's relatively low influence might lie in his highly ambitious epistemologically founded conception of psychology, in his theory of science and in the level of difficulty involved in his wide-ranging methodology.\n* Most psychologies in the subsequent generation appear to have a considerably simpler, less demanding, philosophical point-of-view instead of coordinated causal and teleological considerations embedded in multiple reference systems that consequently also demanded a multi-method approach. Thus instead of perspectivism and a change in perspective an apparently straightforward approach is preferred, i.e. research oriented upon either the natural sciences or the humanities.\n* Wundt's assistants and colleagues, many of whom were also personally close, did not take on the role of students and certainly not the role of interpreters. Oswald K\u00fclpe, Ernst Meumann, Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg or Felix Krueger did not want to, or could not, adequately reference Wundt's comprehensive scientific conception of psychology in their books, for example they almost entirely ignored Wundt's categories and epistemological principles, his strategies in comparison and interpretation, the discussions regarding Kant's in-depth criticism of methodology, and Wundt's neuropsychology. Nobody in this circle developed a creative continuation of Wundt's concepts. Krueger's inner distance to a scientific concept and the entire work of his predecessor cannot be overlooked.<ref>Felix Krueger: Er\u00f6ffnung des XIII. Kongresses. Die Lage der Seelenwissenschaft in der deutschen Gegenwart. In: Otto Klemm (Hrsg.): Bericht \u00fcber den XIII. Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie in Leipzig vom 16.\u201319. Oktober 1933. Fischer, Jena  1934, pp. 6\u201336.</ref>  \n* Through his definition of \"soul\" as an actual process, Wundt gave up the metaphysical idea of a \"substantial carrier\"; his psychology without a soul was heavily criticized by several contemporary and later psychologists and philosophers.\n* Wundt exposed himself to criticism with his theoretical and experimental psychologically differentiated apperception psychology as opposed to elemental association psychology, and with his comprehensive research programme on a development theory of the human intellect, now seen as an interdisciplinary or trans-disciplinary project.\n\n=== Misunderstandings of basic terms and principles ===\nWundt's terminology also created difficulties because he had \u2013 from today's point-of-view \u2013 given some of his most important ideas unfortunate names so that there were constant misunderstandings. Examples include:<br />\n \n* ''physiological psychology'' \u2013 specifically not a scientific physiological psychology, because by writing the adjective with a small letter Wundt wanted to avoid this misunderstanding that still exists today; for him it was the use of physiological aids in experimental general psychology that mattered. \n* ''Self-observation'' \u2013 not naive introspection, but with training and experimental control of conditions.\n* ''Experiment'' \u2013 this was meant with reference to Francis Bacon \u2013 general, i.e. far beyond the scientific rules of the empirical sciences, so not necessarily a statistically evaluated laboratory experiment.<ref>Wundt: \u00dcber Ausfrageexperimente, 1907, p.&nbsp;301ff</ref> For Wundt psychological experimentation primarily served as a check of trained self-observation. \n* ''Element'' \u2013 not in the sense of the smallest structure, but as a smallest unit of the intended level under consideration, so that, for example, even the central nervous system could be an \"element\". \n* ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' \u2013 cultural psychology \u2013 not ethnology.\n* ''Apperception'' \u2013 not just an increase in attention, but a central and multimodal synthesis. \n* ''Voluntaristic tendency, voluntarism'' \u2013 not an absolute metaphysical postulate, but a primary empirically-psychologically based accentuation of motivated action against the intellectualism and cognitivism of other psychologists.\n\nA representation of Wundt's psychology as \u2018natural science\u2019, \u2018element psychology\u2019 or \u2018dualistic\u2019 conceptions is evidence of enduring misunderstandings. It is therefore necessary to remember Wundt's expressly stated desire for uniformity and lack of contradiction, for the mutual supplementation of psychological perspectives. Wundt's more demanding, sometimes more complicated and relativizing, then again very precise style can also be difficult \u2013 even for today's German readers; a high level of linguistic competence is required. There are only English translations for very few of Wundt's work. In particular, the ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' expanded into three volumes and the ten volumes of V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, all the books on philosophy and important essays on the theory of science remain untranslated.\n\nSuch shortcomings may explain many of the fundamental deficits and lasting misunderstandings in the Anglo-American reception of Wundt's work. Massive misconceptions about Wundt's work have been demonstrated by William James, Granville Stanley Hall, Edward Boring and Edward Titchener  as well as among many later authors. Titchener, a two-year resident of Wundt's lab and one of Wundt's most vocal advocates in the United States, is responsible for several English translations and mistranslations of Wundt's works that supported his own views and approach, which he termed \"structuralism\" and claimed was wholly consistent with Wundt's position.<br />\nAs Wundt's three-volume Logik und Wissenschaftslehre, i.e. his theory of science, also remains untranslated the close interrelationships between Wundt's empirical psychology and his epistemology and methodology, philosophy and ethics are also regularly missing, even if later collections describe individual facets of them.<ref>Bringmann et al., 1980.</ref> Blumenthal's assessment <ref>Arthur L. Blumenthal: Wilhelm Wundt \u2013 Problems of interpretation. In: W.G. Bringmann, E.D. Tweney. (Eds.). Wundt Studies. A Centennial Collection. Hogrefe, Toronto 1980, pp.&nbsp;435\u2013445.</ref> that \"American textbook accounts of Wundt now present highly inaccurate and mythological caricatures of the man and his work\" still appears to be true of most publications about Wundt.\nA highly contradictory picture emerges from any systematic research on his reception. On the one hand, the pioneer of experimental psychology and founder of modern psychology as a discipline is praised, on the other hand, his work is insufficiently tapped and appears to have had little influence. Misunderstandings and stereotypical evaluations continue into the present, even in some representations of the history of psychology and in textbooks. Wundt's entire work is investigated in a more focused manner in more recent assessments regarding the reception of Wundt, and his theory of science and his philosophy is included (Araujo, 2016; Danziger, 1983, 1990, 2001; Fahrenberg, 2011, 2015, 2016; J\u00fcttemann, 2006; Kim, 2016; van Rappard, 1980).\n\n=== Scientific controversies and criticisms ===\nLike other important psychologists and philosophers, Wundt was subject to ideological criticism, for example by authors of a more Christianity-based psychology, by authors with [[Materialism|materialistic]] and [[Positivism|positivistic]] scientific opinions, or from the point-of-view of [[Marxist-Leninist]] philosophy and social theory, as in Leipzig, [[German Democratic Republic]], up to 1990. \nWundt was involved in a number of scientific controversies or was responsible for triggering them:\n* the Wundt-Zeller controversy about the measurability of awareness processes,\n* the Wundt-Meumann controversy about the necessary scope of the scientific principles of applied psychology,\n* the Wundt-B\u00fchler controversy about the methodology of the psychology of thought,\n* the controversy about the psychology of elemental (passive-mechanic) association and integrative (self-active) apperception,\n* the controversy about [[empirio-criticism]], [[positivism]] and critical realism, and \n* the controversy about [[psychologism]].\n\nThere are many forms of criticism of Wundt's psychology, of his apperception psychology, of his motivation theory, of his version of psychophysical parallelism with its concept of \"mental causality\", his refutation of psychoanalytic speculation about the unconscious, or of his critical realism. A recurring criticism is that Wundt largely ignored the areas of psychology that he found less interesting, such as differential psychology, child psychology and educational psychology. In his cultural psychology there is no empirical social psychology because there were still no methods for investigating it at the time. Among his postgraduate students, assistants and other colleagues, however, were several important pioneers: differential psychology, \"mental measurement\" and intelligence testing (James McKeen Cattell, Charles Spearman), social psychology of group pocesses and the psychology of work (Walther Moede), applied psychology (Ernst Meumann, Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg), psychopathology, psychopharmacology and clinical diagnosis (Emil Kraepelin). Wundt further influenced many American psychologists to create psychology graduate programs.\n\n== Wundt's excellence==\n[[File: Wilhelm Wundt, Statue, Southwest University Chongqing, China.jpg|thumb|<center> Wilhelm Wundt <br>\nSouthwest University Chongqing, China </center>]]\nWundt developed the first comprehensive and uniform theory of the science of psychology. The special epistemological and methodological status of psychology is postulated in this wide-ranging conceptualization, characterized by his neurophysiological, psychological and philosophical work. The human as a thinking and motivated subject is not to be captured in the terms of the natural sciences. Psychology requires special categories and autonomous epistemological principles. It is, on the one hand, an empirical humanity but should not, on the other hand, ignore its physiological basis and philosophical assumptions. Thus a varied, multi-method approach is necessary: self-observation, experimentation, generic comparison and interpretation. Wundt demanded the ability and readiness to distinguish between perspectives and reference systems, and to understand the necessary supplementation of these reference systems in changes of perspective. He defined the field of psychology very widely and as interdisciplinary, and also explained just how indispensable is the epistemological-philosophical criticism of psychological theories and their philosophical prerequisites. Psychology should remain connected with philosophy in order to promote this critique of knowledge of the metaphysical presuppositions so widespread among psychologists.\n\nThe conceptual relationships within the complete works created over decades and continuously reworked have hardly been systematically investigated. The most important theoretical basis is the empirical-psychological theory of apperception, based on Leibniz's philosophical position, that Wundt, on the one hand, based on experimental psychology and his neuropsychological modelling and, on the other hand, extrapolated into a development theory for culture. The fundamental reconstruction of Wundt's main ideas is a task that cannot be achieved by any one person today due to the complexity of the complete works. He tried to connect the fundamental controversies of the research directions epistemologically and methodologically by means of a co-ordinated concept \u2013 in a confident handling of the categorically basically different ways of considering the interrelations. Here, during the founding phase of university psychology, he already argued for a highly demanding meta-science meta-scientific reflection \u2013 and this potential to stimulate [[interdisciplinarity]] und [[perspectivism]] (complementary approaches) has by no means been exhausted.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n===Books and articles===\n* Lehre von der Muskelbewegung (The Patterns of Muscular Movement), (Vieweg, Braunschweig 1858).\n* Die Geschwindigkeit des Gedankens (The Velocity of Thought), (Die Gartenlaube 1862, Vol 17, p.&nbsp;263).\n* Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception), (Winter, Leipzig 1862).\n* Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Menschen- und Tierseele (Lectures about Human and Animal Psychology), (Voss, Leipzig Part 1 and 2, 1863/1864; 4th revised ed. 1906).\n* Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen (Textbook of Human Physiology), (Enke, Erlangen 1864/1865, 4th ed. 1878).\n* Die physikalischen Axiome und ihre Beziehung zum Causalprincip (Physical Axioms and their Bearing upon Causality Principles), (Enke, Erlangen 1866).\n* Handbuch der medicinischen Physik (Handbook of Medical Physics), (Enke, Erlangen 1867).

Wundt's paternal grandfather was Friedrich Peter Wundt (1742\u20131805), Professor of Geography and pastor in [[Wieblingen]]. When Wundt was about four years of age, his family moved to [[Heidelsheim]], then a small medieval town in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>Lamberti, 1995, pp. 15-22.</ref>\n\nBorn in Germany at a time that was considered very economically stable, Wundt grew up during a period in which the reinvestment of wealth into educational, medical and technological development was commonplace. An economic strive for the advancement of knowledge catalyzed the development of a new psychological study method, and facilitated his development into the prominent psychological figure he is today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb00821.0001.001|title=Germany, 1866-1945|first=Gordon Alexander|last=Craig|date=22 October 1999|accessdate=22 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nWundt studied from 1851 to 1856 at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], at the [[University of Heidelberg]], and at the [[University of Berlin]]. After graduating as a [[doctor of medicine]] from Heidelberg (1856), doctoral advisor [[Karl Ewald Hasse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Wundt studied briefly with [[Johannes Peter M\u00fcller]], before joining the Heidelberg University's staff, becoming an assistant to the [[Physics|physicist]] and physiologist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1858 with responsibility for teaching the laboratory course in physiology. There he wrote ''Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception'' (1858\u20131862). In 1864, he became Associate Professor for [[Anthropology]] and [[Medical Psychology]] and published a textbook about human physiology. However, his main interest, according to his lectures and classes, was not in the medical field \u2013 he was more attracted by psychology and related subjects. His lectures on psychology were published as ''Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology'' in 1863\u20131864. Wundt applied himself to writing a work that came to be one of the most important in the history of psychology, ''Principles of Physiological Psychology'', in 1874. This was the first textbook that was written pertaining to the field of experimental psychology.<ref>Lamberti, 1995, pp. 81-86, pp. 114-134.</ref>\n\nIn 1867, near Heidelberg, Wundt met Sophie Mau (1844\u20131912). She was the eldest daughter of the Kiel theology professor [[:de: Heinrich August Mau]] and his wife Louise, n\u00e9e von Rumohr, and a sister of the archaeologist [[August Mau]]. They married on 14 August 1872 in Kiel.<ref>Lamberti, 1995, pp. 87-113.</ref> The couple had three children: Eleanor (*1876\u20131957), who became an assistant to her father in many ways, Louise, called Lilli, (*1880\u20131884) and [[:de: Max Wundt]] (*1879\u20131963), who became a philosophy professor.\n\nIn 1875, Wundt was promoted to professor of \"Inductive Philosophy\" in Zurich, and in 1875, Wundt was made professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig where [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795\u20131878) and [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] (1801\u20131887) had initiated research on sensory psychology and [[psychophysics]] \u2013 and where two centuries earlier [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] had developed his philosophy and [[theoretical psychology]], which strongly influenced Wundt's intellectual path. Wundt's admiration for Ernst Heinrich Weber was clear from his memoirs where he proclaimed that Weber should be regarded as  the father of experimental psychology: \u201cI would rather call Weber the father of experimental psychology\u2026It was Weber\u2019s great contribution to think of measuring psychic quantities and of showing the exact relationships between them, to be the first to understand this and carry it out.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=David|date=Autumn 2017|title=David K.

The new lab was full of graduate students carrying out research on topics assigned by Wundt, and it soon attracted young scholars from all over the world who were eager to learn about the new science that Wundt had developed.\n\nThe University of Leipzig assigned Wundt a lab in 1876 to store equipment he had brought from Zurich. Located in the Konvikt building, many of Wundt's demonstrations took place in this laboratory due to the inconvenience of transporting his equipment between the lab and his classroom. Wundt arranged for the construction of suitable instruments and collected many pieces of equipment such as [[tachistoscope]]s, [[Clock|chronoscopes]], pendulums, electrical devices, timers, and sensory mapping devices, and was known to assign an instrument to various graduate students with the task of developing uses for future research in experimentation.<ref>Wontorra: Fr\u00fche apparative Psychologie, 2009.</ref> Between 1885 and 1909, there were 15 assistants.<ref name=\"Meischner-Metge2003\">Anneros Meischner-Metge: Wilhelm Wundt und seine Sch\u00fcler.

The laboratory grew and encompassing a total of eleven rooms, the Psychological Institute, as it became known, eventually moved to a new building that Wundt had designed specifically for psychological research.<ref>Wundt: Das Institut f\u00fcr experimentelle Psychologie, 1909, 118-133.</ref> The list of Wundt's lectures during the winter terms of 1875-1879 shows a wide-ranging programme, 6 days a week, on average 2 hours daily, e.g. in the winter term of 1875: [[Psychology of language]], [[Anthropology]], [[Logic]] and [[Epistemology]]; and during the subsequent summer term: [[Psychology]], Brain and Nerves, as well as [[Physiology]]. [[Cosmology]], Historical and General [[Philosophy]] were included in the following terms.<ref>Bringmann, Ungerer: The Foundation of the Institute for Experimental Psychology at Leipzig University. Psychological Research, 1990, Volume 42, p. 13.</ref>\n\nWundt was responsible for an extraordinary number of doctoral dissertations between 1875 and 1919: 184 PhD students included 70 foreigners (of which 23 were from Russia, Poland  and other east-European countries, 18 were American).<ref name=\"Meischner-Metge2003\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://psychologie.biphaps.uni-leipzig.de/hist.html|title=Homepage des Instituts f\u00fcr Psychologie an der Universit\u00e4t Leipzig|website=psychologie.biphaps.uni-leipzig.de|accessdate=22 October 2019}}</ref> Several of Wundt's students became eminent psychologists in their own right.

He was convinced that, for example, the process of spatial perception could not solely be explained on a physiological level, but also involved psychological principles. Wundt founded [[experimental psychology]] as a discipline and became a pioneer of [[cultural psychology]]. He created a broad research programme in empirical psychology and developed a system of [[philosophy]] and [[ethics]] from the basic concepts of his psychology \u2013 bringing together several disciplines in one person.\n\nWundt's [[epistemological]] position \u2013 against [[John Locke]] and English [[empiricism]] ([[sensualism]]) \u2013 was made clear in his book ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) published in 1862, by his use of a quotation from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] on the title page:\n\n\"Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse.\" (Leibniz, Nouveaux essais, 1765, Livre II, Des Id\u00e9es, Chapitre 1, \u00a7 6).\n\u2013 Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself.\n\nPrinciples that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: [[logical inference]]s, [[Categorization|categories]] of thought, the principle of [[causality]], the principle of [[purpose]] ([[teleology]]), the principle of [[emergence]] and other epistemological principles.\n\nWundt's most important books are:\n\n* ''Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen'' (Textbook of Human Physiology) (1864/1865, 4th ed. 1878);\n* ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' (Principles of Physiological Psychology), (1874; 6th ed. 1908-1911, 3 Vols.);\n* ''System der Philosophie'' (System of Philosophy), (1889; 4th ed. 1919, 2 Vols.);\n* ''Logik. Eine Untersuchung der Prinzipien der Erkenntnis und der Methoden wissenschaftlicher Forschung'' (Logic. An investigation into the principles of knowledge and the methods of scientific research), (1880-1883; 4th ed. 1919-1921, 3 Vols.);\n* ''Ethik'' (Ethics), (1886; 3rd ed. 1903, 2 Vols.);\n* ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Eine Untersuchung der Entwicklungsgesetze von Sprache, Mythos und Sitte'' (Cultural Psychology. An investigation into developmental laws of language, myth, and conduct), (1900-1920, 10 Vols.);\n* ''Grundriss der Psychologie'' (Outline of Psychology), (1896; 14th ed. 1920).\n \nThese 22 volumes cover an immense variety of topics. On examination of the complete works, however, a close relationship between Wundt's theoretical psychology, [[epistemology]] and [[methodology]] can be seen.

Mental (psychological) phenomena are changing processes of [[consciousness]]. They can only be determined as an [[actuality]], an \"immediate reality of an event in the psychological experience\".<ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, S. 393.</ref> The relationships of consciousness, i.e. the actively organising processes, are no longer explained [[metaphysically]] by means of an [[immortality|immortal]] \u2018[[soul]]\u2019 or an abstract [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] ([[spirituality|spiritual]]) principle.\n\n'''The delineation of categories'''\n\nWundt considered that reference to the subject (Subjektbezug), value assessment (Wertbestimmung), the existence of [[purpose]] (Zwecksetzung), and volitional acts (Willenst\u00e4tigkeit) to be specific and fundamental categories for psychology.<ref>Wundt: Ueber psychische Causalit\u00e4t und das Princip des psycho-physischen Parallelismus, 1894</ref> He frequently used the formulation \"the human as a motivated and thinking subject\" <ref>Wundt: Logik. 1921, Band 3, S. 15\u201319.</ref> in order to characterise features held in common with the [[humanities]] and the categorical difference to the [[natural sciences]].<ref>Fahrenberg: Zur Kategorienlehre der Psychologie, 2013, S. 86\u2013131.</ref>\n\n[[Psychophysical parallelism]]<br />\n \nInfluenced by Leibniz, Wundt introduced the term psychophysical parallelism as follows: \"\u2026 wherever there are regular relationships between mental and physical phenomena the two are neither identical nor convertible into one another because they are per se incomparable; but they are associated with one another in the way that certain mental processes regularly correspond to certain physical processes or, figuratively expressed, run 'parallel to one another'.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Band 3, S. 769.</ref> Although the inner experience is based on the functions of the brain there are no physical causes for mental changes.\n\nLeibniz wrote: \"Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.\" (Monadology, Paragraph 79).<ref>G. W. Leibniz: Die Prinzipien der Philosophie und Monadologie (Les principles de la philosophie ou la monadologie. 1714/1720). In: Thomas Leinkauf (Hrsg.): Leibniz. Eugen Diederichs Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 1996, S. 406\u2013424).</ref>\n\nWundt follows Leibniz and differentiates between a ''physical'' causality (natural causality of [[neurophysiology]]) and a ''mental'' (''psychic'') causality of the consciousness process. Both causalities, however, are not opposites in a dualistic metaphysical sense, but depend on the standpoint <ref>Wundt, 1894; 1897; 1902\u20131903, Volume 3.</ref>  [[Causal explanation]]s in psychology must be content to seek the effects of the antecedent causes without being able to derive exact predictions. Using the example of volitional acts, Wundt describes possible inversion in considering cause and effect, [[ends and means]], and explains how causal and teleological explanations can complement one another to establish a co-ordinated consideration.\n\nWundt's position differed from contemporary authors who also favoured parallelism. Instead of being content with the postulate of parallelism, he developed his principles of ''mental causality'' in contrast to the natural causality of neurophysiology, and a corresponding methodology. There are two fundamentally different approaches of the postulated psychophysical unit, not just two points-of-view in the sense of Gustav Theodor Fechner's [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] hypothesis. Psychological and physiological statements exist in two categorically different [[reference system]]s; the important categories are to be emphasised in order to prevent [[category mistake]]s as discussed by [[Nicolai Hartmann]].<ref>Nicolai Hartmann. Der Aufbau der realen Welt. Grundriss der allgemeinen Kategorienlehre. De Gruyter, Berlin 1940, 2nd ed. 1949, pp.87 ff.)</ref> In this regard, Wundt created the first genuine epistemology and methodology of empirical psychology (the term [[philosophy of science]] did not yet exist).\n\n'''Apperception'''\n\n[[Apperception]] is Wundt's central theoretical concept. Leibniz described apperception as the process in which the elementary sensory impressions pass into [[Self-consciousness|(self-)consciousness]], whereby individual aspirations (striving, volitional acts) play an essential role. Wundt developed psychological concepts, used experimental psychological methods and put forward neuropsychological modelling in the [[frontal cortex]] of the [[brain]] system \u2013 in line with today's thinking. Apperception exhibits a range of theoretical assumptions on the integrative process of consciousness. The selective control of [[attention]] is an elementary example of such active cognitive, emotional and motivational integration.\n\n'''Development theory of the mind'''\n\nThe fundamental task is to work out a comprehensive development theory of the [[mind]] \u2013 from [[animal psychology]] to the highest cultural achievements in language, religion and ethics. Unlike other thinkers of his time, Wundt had no difficulty connecting the development concepts of the humanities (in the spirit of [[Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]) with the biological theory of evolution as expounded by [[Charles Darwin]].\n\n'''Critical realism'''\n\nWundt determined that \"psychology is an empirical science co-ordinating natural science and humanities, and that the considerations of both complement one another in the sense that only together can they create for us a potential empirical knowledge.\" <ref>Wundt: \u00dcber naiven und kritischen Realismus, 1896\u20131898.</ref><ref>Wundt: \u00dcber die Definition der Psychologie, 1896, pp. 21.</ref> He claimed that his views were free of metaphysics and were based on certain epistemological [[presuppositions]], including the differentiation of subject and object in the perception, and the principle of causality.<ref>Wundt: \u00dcber empirische und metaphysische Psychologie, 1904, pp. 336.</ref> With his term ''critical realism'', Wundt distinguishes himself from other philosophical positions.\n\n'''Definition of psychology'''\n\nWundt set himself the task of redefining the broad field of psychology between philosophy and physiology, between the humanities and the natural sciences. In place of the metaphysical definition as a science of the soul came the definition, based on scientific theory, of empirical psychology as a psychology of consciousness with its own categories and epistemological principles. Psychology examines the \"entire experience in its immediately subjective reality.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, 14th ed. p. 14.</ref> The task of psychology is to precisely analyse the processes of consciousness, to assess the complex connections (''psychische Verbindungen''), and to find the laws governing such relationships.\n\n1. Psychology is ''not'' a science of the individual ''soul''. Life is a uniform mental and physical process that can be considered in a variety of ways in order to recognise general principles, particularly the psychological-historical and biological principles of [[Developmental psychology|development]]. Wundt demanded an understanding of the emotional and the volitional functions, in addition to cognitive features, as equally important aspects of the unitary (whole) psychophysical process.\n\n2. Psychology cannot be reduced to physiology. The tools of physiology remain fundamentally insufficient for the task of psychology. Such a project is meaningless \"because the interrelations between mental processes would be incomprehensible even if the interrelations between brain processes were as clearly understood as the mechanism of a pocket watch.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3, S. 777.</ref><br />\n \n3. Psychology is concerned with conscious processes. Wundt rejected making [[subconscious]] mental processes a topic of scientific psychology for epistemological and methodological reasons. In his day there were, before [[Sigmund Freud]], influential authors such as the philosopher [[Eduard von Hartmann]] (1901), who postulated a metaphysics of ''the unconscious''. Wundt had two fundamental objections. He rejected all primarily metaphysically founded psychology and he saw no reliable methodological approach. He also soon revised his initial assumptions about unconscious judgements <ref>Saulo de F. Araujo: Why did Wundt abandon his early theory of the unconscious? 2012, Volume 15, pp. 33\u201349.</ref><ref>Saulo de F. Araujo: Wundt and the Philosophical Foundations of Psychology. A Reappraisal.  2016.</ref> When Wundt rejects the assumption of \"the unconscious\" he is also showing his scepticism regarding Fechner's theory of the unconscious and Wundt is perhaps even more greatly influenced by the flood of writing at the time on [[hypnotism]] and [[spiritualism]] (Wundt, 1879, 1892). While Freud frequently quoted from Wundt's work, Wundt remained sceptical about all hypotheses that operated with the concept of \"the unconscious\".<ref>Christfried T\u00f6gel: Freud und Wundt. Von der Hypnose bis zur V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. In: B. Nitzschke (Ed.). Freud und die akademische Psychologie. Urban & Schwarzenberg: M\u00fcnchen: 1989, pp. 97\u2013105.</ref><ref>Fahrenberg: Theoretische Psychologie, 2015, pp. 310\u2013314.</ref>\n\nFor Wundt it would be just as much a misunderstanding to define psychology as a [[behavioural science]] in the sense of the later concept of strict [[behaviourism]]. Numerous behavioural and psychological variables had already been observed or measured at the Leipzig laboratory. Wundt stressed that physiological effects, for example the physiological changes accompanying [[feelings]], were only tools of psychology, as were the physical measurements of stimulus intensity in [[psychophysics]]. Further developing these methodological approaches one-sidedly would ultimately, however, lead to a behavioural physiology, i.e. a [[scientific reductionism]], and not to a general psychology and cultural psychology.\n\n4. Psychology is an empirical humanities science. Wundt was convinced of the triple status of psychology:\n\n* as a science of the direct experience it contrasts with the natural sciences that refer to the indirect content of experience and abstract from the subject;\n* as a science \"of generally valid forms of direct human experience it is the foundation of the humanities\";\n* among all the empirical sciences it was \"the one whose results most benefit the examination of the general problems of epistemology and ethics \u2013 the two fundamental areas of philosophy.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, 14th ed., pp. 18 f.</ref>\n\nWundt's concepts were developed during almost 60 years of research and teaching that led him from neurophysiology to psychology and philosophy. The interrelationships between physiology, philosophy, logic, epistemology and ethics are therefore essential for an understanding of Wundt's psychology. The core of Wundt's areas of interest and guiding ideas can already be seen in his ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Menschen- und Tierseele'' (Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology) of 1863: ''individual psychology'' (now known as general psychology, i.e. areas such as perception, attention, apperception, volition, will, feelings and emotions); ''cultural psychology'' (Wundt's V\u00f6lkerpsychologie) as development theory of the human mind); ''animal psychology''; and ''neuropsychology''. The initial conceptual outlines of the 30-year-old Wundt (1862, 1863) led to a long research program, to the founding of the first Institute and to the treatment of psychology as a discipline, as well as to a range of fundamental textbooks and numerous other publications.\n\n== Physiology ==\nDuring the Heidelberg years from 1853 to 1873, Wundt published numerous essays on physiology, particularly on experimental neurophysiology, a textbook on human physiology (1865, 4th ed. 1878) and a manual of medical physics (1867). He wrote about 70 reviews of current publications in the fields of neurophysiology and neurology, physiology, anatomy and histology. A second area of work was sensory physiology, including spatial perception, visual perception and optical illusions. \nAn [[optical illusion]] described by him is called the ''[[Wundt illusion]]'', a variant of the [[Hering Illusion]]. It shows how straight lines appear curved when seen against a set of radiating lines.\n\n[[File:Wundt illusion.svg|thumb|right|160px|<center>Wundt illusion</center>]]\n\n== Psychology ==\n\n=== Starting point ===\nAs a result of his medical training and his work as an assistant to Hermann von Helmholtz, Wundt knew the benchmarks of experimental research, as well as the speculative nature of psychology in the mid-19th century. Wundt's aspiration for scientific research and the necessary methodological critique were clear when he wrote of the language of ordinary people, who merely invoked their personal experiences of life, criticized naive introspection, or quoted the influence of uncritical amateur (\"folk\") psychology on psychological interpretation.<ref>Wundt: V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, 1900, Volume 1, p. 15; Wundt: Logik, 1921, Volume 3, p. 297.</ref> \n \nHis ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (1862) shows Wundt's transition from a physiologist to an experimental psychologist. \"Why does not psychology follow the example of the natural sciences? It is an understanding that, from every side of the history of the natural sciences, informs us that the progress of every science is closely connected with the progress made regarding experimental methods.\" <ref>Wundt: Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung, 1862, p. XI.</ref> With this statement, however, he will in no way treat psychology as a pure natural science, though psychologists should learn from the progress of methods in the natural sciences: \"There are two sciences that must come to the aid of general psychology in this regard: the development history of the mind and comparative psychology.\" <ref>Wundt: Beitr\u00e4ge, 1862, p. XVI.</ref>\n\n=== General psychology ===\nThe ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' (''Main Features of Physiological Psychology'') on general psychology is Wundt's best-known textbook. He wanted to connect two sciences with one another. \"Physiology provides information on all phenomena of life that can be perceived using our external senses. In psychology humans examine themselves, as it were, from within and look for the connections between these processes to explain which of them represent this inner observation.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1874, p. 1.</ref>\n\n\"With sufficient certainty the approach can indeed be seen as well-founded \u2013 that nothing takes place in our consciousness that does not have its physical basis in certain physiological processes.\".<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1874, p. 858.</ref>  Wundt believed that physiological psychology had the following task: \"firstly, to investigate those life processes that are centrally located, between external and internal experience, which make it necessary to use both observation methods simultaneously, external and internal, and, secondly, to illuminate and, where possible, determine a total view of human existence from the points of view gained from this investigation.\" \"The attribute \u2018physiological\u2019 is not saying that it ... [physiological psychology] ... wants to reduce the psychology to physiology \u2013 which I consider impossible \u2013 but that it works with physiological, i.e. experimental, tools and, indeed, more so than is usual in other psychology, takes into account the relationship between mental and physical processes.\" \"If one wants to treat the peculiarities of the method as the most important factor then our science \u2013 as experimental psychology \u2013 differs from the usual science of the soul purely based on self-observation.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1874, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> \nAfter long chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, the ''Grundz\u00fcge'' (1874) has five sections: the mental elements, mental structure, interactions of the mental structure, mental developments, the principles and laws of mental causality. Through his insistence that mental processes were analysed in their elements, Wundt did not want to create a pure element psychology because the elements should simultaneously be related to one another. He describes the sensory impression with the simple sensory feelings, perceptions and volitional acts connected with them, and he explains dependencies and feedbacks.\n\nApperception theory\nWundt rejected the widespread [[association theory]], according to which mental connections ([[learning]]) are mainly formed through the frequency and intensity of particular processes. His term ''apperception psychology'' means that he considered the ''creative'' conscious activity to be more important than elementary association. Apperception is an emergent activity that is both arbitrary and selective as well as imaginative and comparative. In this process, feelings and ideas are images apperceptively connected with typical tones of feeling, selected in a variety of ways, analysed, associated and combined, as well as linked with motor and autonomic functions \u2013 not simply ''processed'' but also ''creatively synthesised'' (see below on the Principle of creative synthesis). In the integrative process of conscious activity, Wundt sees an elementary activity of the subject, i.e. an act of volition, to deliberately move content into the conscious. Insofar that this emergent activity is typical of all mental processes, it is possible to describe his point-of-view as voluntaristic.\n\nWundt describes apperceptive processes as psychologically highly differentiated and, in many regards, bases this on methods and results from his experimental research. One example is the wide-ranging series of experiments on the [[mental chronometry]] of complex [[reaction time]]s. In research on feelings, certain effects are provoked while pulse and breathing are recorded using a [[kymograph]]. The observed differences were intended to contribute towards supporting Wundt's [[Emotion theory|theory of emotions]] with its three dimensions: pleasant \u2013 unpleasant, tense \u2013 relaxed, excited \u2013 depressed.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902, Volume 2, pp. 263-369.</ref>\n\n=== Cultural psychology ===\nWilhelm Wundt's ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Eine Untersuchung der Entwicklungsgesetze von Sprache, Mythus und Sitte'' (''Social Psychology. An Investigation of the Laws of Evolution of Language, Myth, and Custom'', 1900-1920, 10 Vols.) which also contains the evolution of [[Arts]], [[Law]], [[Society]], [[Culture]] and ''History'', is a milestone project, a monument of [[cultural psychology]], of the early 20th century. The dynamics of cultural development were investigated according to psychological and epistemological principles. Psychological principles were derived from Wundt's psychology of apperception (theory of higher integrative processes, including association, [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[semantic change]]) and [[motivation]] (will), as presented in his ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' (1908-1910, 6th ed., 3 Vols.). In contrast to individual psychology, cultural psychology aims to illustrate general mental development laws governing higher intellectual processes: the development of thought, language, artistic imagination, myths, religion, customs, the relationship of individuals to society, the intellectual environment and the creation of intellectual works in a society. \"Where deliberate experimentation ends is where history has experimented on the behalf of psychologists.\" <ref>Wundt, 1863, p. IX.</ref> Those mental processes that \"underpin the general development of human societies and the creation of joint intellectual results that are of generally recognised value\" <ref>Wundt V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, 1911, 3rd ed. Vol. 1, p. 1.</ref> are to be examined.\n\nStimulated by the ideas of previous thinkers, such as [[Herder]], [[Herbart]], [[Hegel]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (with his ideas about comparative [[linguistics]]), the psychologist [[Moritz Lazarus]] (1851) and the [[linguist]] [[Heymann Steinthal]] founded the ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' (Journal for Cultural Psychology and Linguistics) in 1860, which gave this field its name. Wundt (1888) critically analysed the, in his view, still disorganised intentions of Lazarus and Steinthal and limited the scope of the issues by proposing a psychologically constituted structure. The cultural psychology of language, myth, and customs were to be based on the three main areas of general psychology: imagining and thought, feelings, and will (motivation). The numerous mental interrelations and principles were to be researched under the perspective of cultural development. Apperception theory applied equally for general psychology and cultural psychology. Changes in meanings and motives were examined in many lines of development, and there are detailed interpretations based on the emergence principle (creative synthesis), the principle of unintended side-effects (heterogony of ends) and the principle of contrast (see section on ''Methodology and Strategies'').\n\nThe ten volumes consist of: Language (Vols. 1 and 2), Art (Vol. 3), Myths and Religion (Vols. 4 - 6), Society (Vols. 7 and 8), Law (Vol. 9), as well as Culture and History (Vol. 10). The methodology of cultural psychology was mainly described later, in ''Logik'' (1921). Wundt worked on, psychologically linked, and structured an immense amount of material. The topics range from agriculture and trade, crafts and property, through gods, myths and Christianity, marriage and family, peoples and nations to (self-)education and self-awareness, science, the world and humanity.\n\nWundt recognized about 20 ''fundamental dynamic motives in cultural development''. Motives frequently quoted in cultural development are: division of labour, ensoulment, salvation, happiness, production and imitation, child-raising, artistic drive, welfare, arts and magic, adornment, guilt, punishment, atonement, self-education, play, and revenge. Other values and motives emerge in the areas of freedom and justice, war and peace, legal structures, state structures and forms of government; also regarding the development of a world view of culture, religion, state, traffic, and a worldwide political and social society. In religious considerations, many of the values and motives (i.e. belief in soul, immortality, belief in gods and demons, ritualistic acts, witchcraft, animism and totemism) are combined with the motives of art, imagination, dance and ecstasy, as well as with forms of family and power.\n\nWundt saw examples of human [[self-education]] in walking upright, physical facilities and \"an interaction in part forced upon people by external conditions and in part the result of voluntary culture\".<ref>Wundt, V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Vol. 10, p. 189.</ref> He described the random appearance and later conscious control of fire as a similar interaction between two motives. In the interaction of human activity and the conditions of nature he saw a creative principle of culture right from the start; tools as cultural products of a second nature. An interactive system of cause and effect, a system of purposes and thus values (and reflexively from standards of one's own activities) is formed according to the principles of one's own thinking.<ref>Wundt, V\u00f6lkerpsychologie. Vol. 10, p. 195.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Elemente der V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' (The Elements of Cultural Psychology, 1912) Wundt sketched out four main levels of cultural development: primitive man, the totemistic age, the age of heroes and gods, and the development of humanity. The delineations were unclear and the depiction was greatly simplified. Only this book was translated into English ''Elements of folk-psychology'' <ref>Tr. Schaub, E.L. Allen, London 1916.</ref>), thus providing but a much abridged insight into Wundt's differentiated cultural psychology. (The [[Folk Psychology]] part of the title already demonstrates the low level of understanding).\n\nIn retrospect, \u2018V\u00f6lkerpsychologie\u2019 was an unfortunate choice of title because it is often misinterpreted as [[ethnology]]. Wundt also considered calling it (Social) [[Anthropology]], [[Social Psychology]] and [[Community Psychology]]. The term ''Kulturpsychologie'' would have been more fitting though ''psychological development theory of the mind'' would have expressed Wundt's intentions even better.<ref>Fahrenberg: Wilhelm Wundts Kulturpsychologie (V\u00f6lkerpsychologie), 2016b.</ref> The intellectual potential and heuristics of Wundt's Cultural Psychology are by no means exhausted.\n\n=== Neuropsychology ===\nWundt contributed to the state of [[neuropsychology]] as it existed at the time in three ways: through his criticism of the theory of localisation (then widespread in [[neurology]]), through his demand for research hypotheses founded on both neurological and psychological thinking, and through his neuropsychological concept of an apperception centre in the [[frontal cortex]]. Wundt considered [[attention]] and the control of attention an excellent example of the desirable combination of experimental psychological and neurophysiological research. Wundt called for experimentation to localise the higher central nervous functions to be based on clear, psychologically-based research hypotheses because the questions could not be rendered precisely enough on the anatomical and physiological levels alone.\n [[File:Apperzeptionszentrum (Wundt, Grundz\u00fcge, 1903, 5th ed. Vol. 1, p. 324).jpg|thumb|<center>(Wundt, ''Grundz\u00fcge'', 1903, 5th ed. Vol. 1, p. 324.)</center>]]\nWundt based his central theory of apperception on neuropsychological modelling (from the 3rd edition of the ''Grundz\u00fcge'' onwards). According to this, the hypothetical apperception centre in the frontal cerebral cortex that he described could interconnect sensory, motor, autonomic, cognitive, emotional and motivational process components <ref>Ziche: Neuroscience in its context, 1999.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fahrenberg: Wundts Neuropsychologie, 2015b.</ref> Wundt thus provided the guiding principle of a primarily psychologically-oriented research programme on the highest integrative processes. He is therefore a forerunner of current research on cognitive and emotional [[executive functions]] in the prefrontal cerebral cortex, and on hypothetical ''multimodal convergence zones'' in the network of cortical and limbic functions. This concept of an interdisciplinary [[neuroscience]] is now taken for granted, but Wundt's contribution towards this development has almost been forgotten. [[Charles Scott Sherrington|C.S. Sherrington]] repeatedly quotes Wundt's research on the physiology of the [[reflexes]] in his textbook,<ref>Ch. S. Sherrington: The integrative Action of the Nervous System. Henry Frowde, London 1911.</ref> but not Wundt's neuropsychological concepts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Methodology and strategies ==\n\"Given its position between the natural sciences and the humanities, psychology really does have a great wealth of methodological tools. While, on the one hand, there are the experimental methods, on the other hand, objective works and products in cultural development (''Objektivationen des menschlichen Geistes'') also offer up abundant material for comparative psychological analysis\".<ref>Wundt: Logik, 1921, 4th ed., Volume 3, p. 51.</ref>\n\nPsychology is an empirical science and must endeavor to achieve a systematic procedure, examination of results, and criticism of its methodology. Thus [[self-observation]] must be trained and is only permissible under strict experimental control; Wundt decisively rejects naive [[introspection]]. Wundt provided a standard definition of psychological experiments.<ref>Wundt, 1907, 1908, 1921.</ref> His dispute with [[Immanuel Kant]] (Wundt, 1874) had a major influence. Kant had argued against the assumption of the measurability of conscious processes and made a well-founded, if very short, criticism of the methods of self-observation: regarding method-inherent reactivity, observer error, distorting attitudes of the subject, and the questionable influence of ''independently thinking people'',<ref>Immanuel Kant: Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. Schriften zur Anthropologie, Geschichtsphilosophie, Politik und P\u00e4dagogik. (Immanuel Kant Werkausgabe. Band 6). hrsg. von Wilhelm Weischedel. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1798/1983, pp. 395\u2013690.</ref> but Wundt expressed himself optimistic that methodological improvements could be of help here.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge 1874, pp. 5-8.</ref> He later admitted that [[measurement]] and mathematics were only applicable for very elementary conscious processes. [[Statistical methods]] were also of only limited value, for example in psychophysics or in the evaluation of [[population statistics]].<ref>Fahrenberg: Theoretische Psychologie, 2015a, pp. 115-126; pp. 228-234.</ref>\n\nExperimental psychology in Leipzig mainly lent on four methodological types of assessment: the ''impression methods'' with their various measurement techniques in psychophysics; the ''reaction methods'' for chronometry in the psychology of apperception; the ''reproduction methods'' in research on memory, and the ''expression methods'' with observations and psychophysiological measurement in research on feelings.<ref>Wundt. Grundz\u00fcge, 1908-1910.</ref><ref>Wontorra, 2009.</ref> Wundt considered the methodology of his linguistic psychological investigations (Vols. 1 and 2 of V\u00f6lkerpsychologie) to be the most fruitful path to adequate psychological research on the thought process.\n\nThe principles of his cultural psychological methodology were only worked out later. These involved the analytical and comparative observation of objective existing materials, i.e. historical writings, language, works, art, reports and observations of human behaviour in earlier cultures and, more rarely, direct ethnological source material. Wundt differentiated between two objectives of comparative methodology: individual comparison collected all the important features of the overall picture of an observation material, while generic comparison formed a picture of variations to obtain a typology. Rules of generic comparison and critical interpretation are essentially explained in his Logik:<ref>Wundt, 1921, pp. 62 ff, 238 f; 1920a, p. 372.)</ref>\n\n\"We therefore generally describe the epitome of the methods as interpretation that is intended to provide us with an understanding of mental processes and intellectual creation.\" Wundt clearly referred to the tradition of humanistic [[hermeneutics]], but argued that the interpretation process basically also followed psychological principles. Interpretation only became the characteristic process of the humanities through criticism. It is a process that is set against interpretation to dismantle the interaction produced through psychological analysis. It examines external or internal contradictions, it should evaluate the reality of intellectual products, and is also a criticism of values and a criticism of opinions. The typical misconceptions of the intellectualistic, individualistic and unhistorical interpretation of intellectual processes all have \"their source in the habitually coarse psychology based on subjective assessment.\" <ref>Wundt: Logik, 1921, 4th ed., Volume 3, p. 297.</ref>\n\n=== Principles of mental causality ===\nWhat is meant by these principles is ''the simple prerequisites of the linking of psychological facts that cannot be further extrapolated''. The system of principles has several repeatedly reworked versions, with corresponding laws of development for cultural psychology (Wundt, 1874, 1894, 1897, 1902\u20131903, 1920, 1921). Wundt mainly differentiated between four principles and explained them with examples that originate from the physiology of perception, the psychology of meaning, from apperception research, emotion and motivation theory, and from cultural psychology and ethics.\n\n(1) ''The Principle of [[creative synthesis]] or creative results'' (the emergence principle). \"Every perception can be broken down into elemental impressions. But it is never just the sum of these impressions, but from the linkage of them that a new one is created with individual features that were not contained in the impressions themselves. We thus put together the mental picture of a spatial form from a multitude of impressions of light. This principle proves itself in all mental causality linkages and accompanies mental development from its first to its consummate stage.\" Wundt formulated this creative synthesis, which today would also be described as the principle of emergence in [[system theory]], as an essential epistemological principle of empirical psychology \u2013 long before the phrase ''the whole is more than the sum of its parts'' or supra-summation was used in [[gestalt psychology]].<ref>Wundt: Vorlesungen \u00fcber Menschen- und Tierseele, 1863, Volume 1, p. 435 f.</ref><ref>Wundt: Erlebtes und Erkanntes, 1920, p. 183.</ref>\n\n(2) ''The Principle of relational analysis'' (context principle). This principle says that \"every individual mental content receives its meaning through the relationships in which it stands to other mental content.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1920, p. 401.</ref>\n\n(3) ''The Principle of mental contrasts or reinforcement of opposites or development in dichotomies.'' Typical contrast effects are to be seen in sensory perceptions, in the course of emotions and in volitional processes. There is a general tendency to order the subjective world according to opposites. Thus many individual, historical, economic and social processes exhibit highly contrasting developments.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3, S. 785.</ref>\n\n(4) ''The Principle of the [[heterogony]] of purpose (ends).'' The consequences of an action extend beyond the original intended purpose and give rise to new motives with new effects. The intended purpose always induces [[side-effects]] and knock-on effects that themselves become purposes, i.e. an ever-growing organisation through self-creation.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3, p. 789.</ref> \n \nIn addition to these four principles, Wundt explained the term of intellectual community and other categories and principles that have an important relational and insightful function.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Volume 3.</ref>\n\nWundt demands co-ordinated analysis of causal and teleological aspects; he called for a methodologically versatile psychology and did not demand that any decision be made between experimental-statistical methods and interpretative methods ([[qualitative methods]]). Whenever appropriate, he referred to findings from interpretation and experimental research within a [[multimethod]] approach. Thus, for example, the chapters on the development of language or on enlargement of fantasy activity in cultural psychology also contain experimental, statistical and psychophysiological findings.<ref>Meischner-Metge: Die Methode der Forschung, 2006, pp. 131-143.</ref><ref>Fahrenberg, 2016b.</ref> He was very familiar with these methods and used them in extended research projects. This was without precedent and has, since then, rarely been achieved by another individual researcher.\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== Wundt's philosophical orientation ===\nIn the introduction to his ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' in 1874, Wundt described [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] as the philosophers who had the most influence on the formation of his own views. Those who follow up these references will find that Wundt critically analysed both these thinkers\u2019 ideas. He distanced himself from Herbart's science of the soul and, in particular, from his \"mechanism of mental representations\" and pseudo-mathematical speculations.<ref>Wundt: Grundz\u00fcge,1874, Chapter 19.</ref>  While Wundt praised Kant's critical work and his rejection of a \"rational\" psychology deduced from metaphysics, he argued against Kant's epistemology in his publication ''Was soll uns Kant nicht sein?'' (What Kant should we reject?) 1892 with regard to the forms of perception and presuppositions, as well as Kant's category theory and his position in the dispute on causal and teleological explanations.\n\n[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] had a far greater and more constructive influence on Wundt's psychology, philosophy, epistemology and ethics. This can be gleaned from Wundt's Leibniz publication (1917) and from his central terms and principles, but has since received almost no attention.<ref>Fahrenberg, 2016a.</ref> Wundt gave up his plans for a biography of Leibniz, but praised Leibniz's thinking on the two-hundredth anniversary of his death in 1916. He did, however, disagree with Leibniz's [[monadology]] as well as theories on the mathematisation of the world by removing the domain of the mind from this view. Leibniz developed a new concept of the soul through his discussion on substance and [[actuality]], on dynamic spiritual change, and on the correspondence between body and soul ([[Psychophysical parallelism|parallelism]]). Wundt ''secularised'' such guiding principles and reformulated important philosophical positions of Leibniz away from belief in God as the creator and belief in an immortal soul. Wundt gained important ideas and exploited them in an original way in his principles and methodology of empirical psychology: the principle of actuality, psychophysical parallelism, combination of causal and teleological analysis, apperception theory, the psychology of ''striving'', i.e. volition and voluntary tendency, principles of epistemology and the perspectivism of thought. Wundt's differentiation between the \"natural causality\" of neurophysiology and the \"mental causality\" of psychology (the intellect), is a direct rendering from Leibniz's epistemology.<ref>Fahrenberg 2016a.</ref>\n\nWundt devised the term [[psychophysical parallelism]] and meant thereby two fundamentally different ways of considering the postulated psychophysical unit, not just two views in the sense of Fechner's theory of identity. Wundt derived the co-ordinated consideration of natural causality and mental causality from Leibniz's differentiation between causality and teleology ([[principle of sufficient reason]]). The psychological and physiological statements exist in two categorically different [[reference system]]s; the main categories are to be emphasised in order to prevent [[category mistake]]s. With his epistemology of mental causality, he differed from contemporary authors who also advocated the position of parallelism. Wundt had developed the first genuine epistemology and methodology of empirical psychology.\n\nWundt shaped the term apperception, introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling. When Leibniz differentiates between two fundamental functions, perception and striving, this approach can be recognised in Wundt's motivation theory. The central theme of \"unity in the manifold\" (unitas in multitudine) also originates from Leibniz, who has influenced the current understanding of [[perspectivism]] and viewpoint dependency.<ref>Fahrenberg: Zur Kategorienlehre, 2013, S. 288\u2013296.</ref> Wundt characterised this style of thought in a way that also applied for him: \"\u2026the principle of the equality of viewpoints that supplement one another\" plays a significant role in his thinking \u2013 viewpoints that \"supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply.\" <ref>Wundt: Leibniz, 1917, S.117.</ref>\n\nUnlike the great majority of contemporary and current authors in psychology, Wundt laid out the philosophical and methodological positions of his work clearly. Wundt was against the founding empirical psychology on a (metaphysical or structural) principle of soul as in Christian belief in an [[immortal soul]] or in a philosophy that argues \"substance\"-[[ontologically]]. Wundt's position was decisively rejected by several Christianity-oriented psychologists and philosophers as a ''psychology without soul'', although he did not use this formulation from Friedrich Lange (1866), who was his predecessor in Z\u00fcrich from 1870 to 1872. Wundt's guiding principle was the development theory of the mind. Wundt's ethics also led to polemical critiques due to his renunciation of an ultimate transcendental basis of ethics (God, the Absolute). Wundt's [[evolutionism]] was also criticised for its claim that ethical norms had been culturally changed in the course of human intellectual development.<ref>reception analysis, see Fahrenberg 2011, 2015a.</ref>\n\nWundt's autobiography <ref>Wundt: Erlebtes und Erkanntes, 1920</ref> and his inaugural lectures in Zurich and Leipzig <ref>Wundt, 1874; Wundt, 1875.</ref> as well as his commemorative speeches for Fechner <ref>Wundt, 1901.</ref> and his Essay on Leibniz <ref>Wundt, 1917</ref> provide an insight into the history of Wundt's education and the contemporary flows and intellectual controversies in the second half of the 19th century. Wundt primarily refers to Leibniz and Kant, more indirectly to [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]; and to [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]],  [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] regarding psychology. In addition to [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[David Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], one finds [[Francis Bacon]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Charles A. Spencer|Charles Spencer]], as well as French thinkers such as [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Hippolyte Taine]], all of whom are more rarely quoted by Wundt.<ref>Araoujo, 2016; Fahrenberg, 2016a.</ref>\n\n=== Metaphysics ===\n\nWundt distanced himself from the metaphysical term soul and from theories about its structure and properties, as posited by Herbart, Lotze and Fechner. Wundt followed Kant and warned against a primarily metaphysically founded, philosophically deduced psychology: \"where one notices the author's metaphysical point-of-view in the treatment of every problem then an unconditional empirical science is no longer involved \u2013 but a metaphysical theory intended to serve as an exemplification of experience.\" <ref>Wundt: Grundriss der Psychologie, 1896, p. 22.</ref> \nHe is, however, convinced that every single science contains general prerequisites of a philosophical nature. \"All psychological investigation extrapolates from metaphysical presuppositions.\" <ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1919, Volume 1, pp. IX f.</ref>  Epistemology was to help sciences find out about, clarify or supplement their metaphysical aspects and as far as possible free themselves of them. Psychology and the other sciences always rely on the help of philosophy here, and particularly on logic and epistemology, otherwise only an immanent philosophy, i.e. metaphysical assumptions of an unsystematic nature, would form in the individual sciences <ref>Wundt, System der Philosophie, 1897, p. 33.</ref>  Wundt is decidedly against the segregation of philosophy. He is concerned about psychologists bringing their own personal metaphysical convictions into psychology and that these presumptions would no longer be exposed to epistemological criticism. \"Therefore nobody would suffer more from such a segregation than the psychologists themselves and, through them, psychology.\" <ref>Wundt: Die Psychologie im Kampf ums Dasein. 1913, p. 24.</ref> \"Nothing would promote the degeneration [of psychology] to a mere craftsmanship more than its segregation from philosophy.\" <ref>Wundt: Die Psychologie im Kampf ums Dasein. 1913, p. 37.</ref>\n\n=== System of philosophy ===\nWundt claimed that philosophy as a general science has the task of \"uniting to become a consistent system through the general knowledge acquired via the individual sciences.\" Human rationality strives for a uniform, i.e. non-contradictory, explanatory principle for being and consciousness, for an ultimate reasoning for ethics, and for a philosophical world basis. \"Metaphysics is the same attempt to gain a binding world view, as a component of individual knowledge, on the basis of the entire scientific awareness of an age or particularly prominent content.\" <ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1919, Volume 1, p. 17.</ref> Wundt was convinced that empirical psychology also contributed fundamental knowledge on the understanding of humans \u2013 for anthropology and ethics \u2013 beyond its narrow scientific field. Starting from the active and creative-synthetic apperception processes of consciousness, Wundt considered that the unifying function was to be found in volitional processes and the conscious setting of objectives and subsequent activities. \"There is simply nothing more to a man that he can entirely call his own \u2013 except for his will.\" <ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1897, p. 377.</ref> One can detect a \"voluntaristic tendency\" in Wundt's theory of motivation, in contrast to the currently widespread cognitivism ([[intellectualism]]). Wundt extrapolated this empirically founded volitional psychology to a [[metaphysical voluntarism]]. He demands, however, that the empirical-psychological and derived metaphysical voluntarism are kept apart from one another and firmly maintained that his empirical psychology was created independently of the various teachings of metaphysics.<ref>Wundt: System der Philosophie, 1919, Volume 1, p. IX f.</ref>\n\nWundt interpreted intellectual-cultural progress and biological evolution as a general process of development whereby, however, he did not want to follow the abstract ideas of [[entelechy]], [[vitalism]], [[animism]], and by no means [[Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] volitional metaphysics. He believed that the source of dynamic development was to be found in the most elementary expressions of life, in reflexive and instinctive behaviour, and constructed a continuum of attentive and apperceptive processes, volitional or selective acts, up to social activities and ethical decisions. At the end of this rational idea he recognised a practical ideal: the idea of humanity as the highest yardstick of our actions and that the overall course of human history can be understood with regard to the ideal of humanity.<ref>Wundt: Ethik, 1886, p. 577.</ref>\n[[File:Portraitb\u00fcste 0686-90 F22838.jpg|thumb|<center>Wilhelm Wundt portrait bust by Max Klinger 1908</center>]]\n\n=== Ethics ===\nParallel to Wundt's work on cultural psychology he wrote his much-read ''Ethik'' (1886, 3rd ed. in 2 Vols., 1903), whose introduction stressed how important development considerations are in order to grasp [[religion]], [[customs]] and [[morality]]. Wundt considered the questions of ethics to be closely linked with the empirical psychology of motivated acts <ref>(Grundz\u00fcge, 1902\u20131903, Vol. 3.</ref> \"Psychology has been such an important introduction for me, and such an indispensable aid for the investigation of ethics, that I do not understand how one could do without it.\" <ref>Wundt: Ethik, 1886, Vorwort p. III.</ref> Wundt sees two paths: the anthropological examination of the facts of a moral life (in the sense of cultural psychology) and the scientific reflection on the concepts of morals. The derived principles are to be examined in a variety of areas: the family, society, the state, education, etc. In his discussion on [[free will]] (as an attempt to mediate between [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]]) he categorically distinguishes between two perspectives: there is indeed a natural causality of brain processes, though conscious processes are not determined by an intelligible, but by the empirical character of humans \u2013 volitional acts are subject to the principles of mental causality. \"When a man only follows inner causality he acts freely in an ethical sense, which is partly determined by his original disposition and partly by the development of his character.\"<ref>Wundt: Ethik, 1886, p. 410.</ref>\n\nOn the one hand, Ethics is a normative discipline while, on the other hand, these \u2018rules\u2019 change, as can be seen from the empirical examination of culture-related [[morality]]. Wundt's ethics can, put simply, be interpreted as an attempt to mediate between Kant's [[apriorism]] and [[empiricism]]. Moral rules are the legislative results of a universal intellectual development, but are neither rigidly defined nor do they simply follow changing life conditions. [[Individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]] are strictly rejected. In his view, only the universal intellectual life can be considered to be an [[end in itself]]. Wundt also spoke on the idea of humanity in ethics, on [[human rights]] and [[human duties]] in his speech as Rector of Leipzig University in 1889 on the centenary of the [[French Revolution]].\n\n=== Logic, epistemology and the scientific theory of psychology ===\nWundt divided up his three-volume ''Logik'' into General logic and epistemology, Logic of the exact sciences, and Logic of the humanities. While logic, the doctrine of categories, and other principles were discussed by Wundt in a traditional manner, they were also considered from the point of view of development theory of the human intellect, i.e. in accordance with the psychology of thought. The subsequent equitable description of the special principles of the natural sciences and the humanities enabled Wundt to create a new epistemology. The ideas that remain current include epistemology and the methodology of psychology: the tasks and directions of psychology, the methods of interpretation and comparison, as well as psychological experimentation.\n\n== Complete works and legacy ==\n\n=== Publications, libraries and letters ===\n[[File:Wundt-Plakette Leipzig.tif|thumb|<center>Wilhelm Wundt commemorative plaque, University of Leipzig</center>]]\nThe list of works at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]] includes a total of 589 German and foreign-language editions for the period from 1853 to 1950 MPI f\u00fcr Wissenschaftsgeschichte: ''Werkverzeichnis Wilhelm Wundt''.The American psychologist Edwin Boring counted 494 publications by Wundt (excluding pure reprints but with revised editions) that are, on average, 110 pages long and amount to a total of 53,735 pages. Thus Wundt published an average of seven works per year over a period of 68 years and wrote or revised an average of 2.2 pages per day.<ref>Boring: A history of experimental psychology (2nd ed.), 1950, p. 345.</ref> There is as yet no annotated edition of the essential writings, nor does a complete edition of Wundt's major works exist, apart from more-or-less suitable scans or digitalisations.\n\nApart from his library and his correspondence, Wundt's extraordinarily extensive written inheritance also includes many extracts, manuscripts, lecture notes and other materials <ref>Fahrenberg, 2016; Meyer, 2015; Ungerer, 2016.</ref> Wundt's written inheritance in Leipzig consists of 5,576 documents, mainly letters, and was digitalised by the Leipzig University Library. The catalogue is available at the ''Kalliope online portal''.\n\nOne-third of Wundt's own library was left to his children Eleonore and Max Wundt; most of the works were sold during the times of need after the First World War to [[Tohoku University]] in Sendai, Japan. The University's stock consists of 6,762 volumes in western languages (including bound periodicals) as well as 9,098 special print runs and brochures from the original Wundt Library.<ref>M. Takasuma: The Wundt Collection in Japan. In: R.W. Rieber, D. K. Robinson (Hrsg.): Wilhelm Wundt in history: The making of a scientific psychology.

[[T\u00fcbingen University]] Archive's stock includes copies of 613 letters, Wundt's will, lists from Wundt's original library, and other materials and \u2018Wundtiana\u2019:<ref>Inventory UAT 228 with inventory lists UAT 228/16 to 228/24.</ref>  The [[German Historical Museum]] in Berlin has a 1918 shellac disk on which Wundt repeats the closing words of his inaugural lecture (given in Z\u00fcrich on 31 October 1874 and re-read in 1918 for documentation purposes): \"On the task of philosophy in the present\" <ref>Signature T90/447, length of recording is 2 minutes.</ref>\n\n===Biographies ===\nThe last Wundt biography which tried to represent both Wundt's psychology and his philosophy was by Eisler (1902). One can also get an idea of Wundt's thoughts from his autobiography ''Erlebtes und Erkanntes'' (1920). Later biographies by Nef (1923) and Petersen (1925) up to Arnold in 1980 restrict themselves primarily to the psychology ''or'' the philosophy. Eleonore Wundt's (1928) knowledgeable but short biography of her father exceeds many others\u2019 efforts.\n\n=== Political attitude ===\nAt the start of the First World War, Wundt, like [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Max Planck]], signed the patriotic call to arms as did about 4,000 professors and lecturers in Germany, and during the following years he wrote several political speeches and essays that were also characterized by the feeling of a superiority of German science and culture. Wundt was a Liberal during his early Heidelberg time, affiliated with a Workers\u2019 Education Union (Arbeiterbildungsverein), and as a politician in the [[Baden]] State Parliament (see also his speech as Rector of Leipzig University in 1889). In old age he appeared to become more conservative (see Wundt, 1920; Wundt's correspondence), then \u2013 also in response to the war, the subsequent social unrest and the severe revolutionary events of the post-war period \u2013 adopted an attitude that was patriotic and lent towards nationalism. Wilhelm Wundt's son, philosopher Max Wundt, had an even more clearly intense, somewhat nationalist, stance. While he was not a member of the [[Nazi party]] (NSDAP), he wrote about national traditions and race in philosophical thinking.<ref>Mark Michalski: Der Gang des deutschen Denkens. K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann, W\u00fcrzburg 2010.</ref>\n\n===Wundt Societies ===\nFour ''Wilhelm Wundt Societies'' or Associations have been founded:\n\n* 1925 to 1968: ''Wilhelm Wundt Stiftung und Verband Freunde des Psychologischen Instituts der Universit\u00e4t Leipzig'', founded by former assistants and friends of Wundts.   \n* 1979: ''[http://www.wilhelm-wundt-gesellschaft.de Wilhelm Wundt Gesellschaft]'' (based in Heidelberg), \"a scientific association with a limited number of members set up with the aim of promoting fundamental psychological research and further developing it through its efforts.\" \n* 1992 to 1996: ''Wundt-Stiftung e.V. und F\u00f6rderverein Wundt-Stiftung e.V.'' (based in Bonn/Leipzig). \n* 2016: ''F\u00f6rderverein Wilhelm-Wundt-Haus in Grossbothen.''. The purpose of the association is \"the maintenance and restoration of the Wundt home in keeping with its listed building status, as well as its appropriate use\". The association was founded on the initiative of J\u00fcttemann (2014).\n\nDie ''Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie'' [[German Society for Psychology]] grants a Wilhelm-Wundt-Medaille.\n\n== Reception of Wundt's work ==\n\n=== Reception by his contemporaries ===\nThe psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] described the pioneering spirit at the new Leipzig Institute in this fashion: \"We felt that we were trailblazers entering virgin territory, like creators of a science with undreamt-of prospects. Wundt spent several afternoons every week in his adjacent modest Professorial office, came to see us, advised us and often got involved in the experiments; he was also available to us at any time.\" <ref>Emil Kraepelin: Nachruf Wilhelm Wundt. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie 1920, Volume 61, 351-362.</ref>\n\nThe philosopher [[Rudolf Eisler]] considered Wundt's approach as follows: \"A major advantage of Wundt's philosophy is that it neither consciously nor unconsciously takes metaphysics back to its beginnings, but strictly distinguishes between empirical-scientific and epistemological-metaphysical approaches, and considers each point-of-view in isolation in its relative legitimacy before finally producing a uniform world view. Wundt always differentiates between the physical-physiological and the purely psychological, and then again from the philosophical point-of-view. As a result, apparent \u2018contradictions\u2019 are created for those who do not observe more precisely and who constantly forget that the differences in results are only due to the approach and not the laws of reality ...\" <ref>Rudolf Eisler: W. Wundts Philosophie und Psychologie, 1902, p. 13.</ref> Traugott Oesterreich (1923/1951) wrote an unusually detailed description of Wundt's work in his Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie (Foundations of the History of Philosophy). This knowledgeable representation examines Wundt's main topics, views and scientific activities and exceeds the generally much briefer Wundt reception within the field of psychology, in which many of the important prerequisites and references are ignored right from the start.\n\nThe internal consistency of Wundt's work from 1862 to 1920, between the main works and within the reworked editions, has repeatedly been discussed and been subject to differing assessments in parts.<ref>Araujo, 2016; Fahrenberg, 2011, 2015, 2016; Graumann, 1980; J\u00fcttemann 2006.</ref>  One could not say that the scientific conception of psychology underwent a fundamental revision of principal ideas and central postulates, though there was gradual development and a change in emphasis. One could consider Wundt's gradual concurrence with Kant's position, that conscious processes are not measurable on the basis of self-observation and cannot be mathematically formulated, to be a major divergence. Wundt, however, never claimed that psychology could be advanced through experiment and measurement alone, but had already stressed in 1862 that the development history of the mind and comparative psychology should provide some assistance.<ref>Wundt: Beitr\u00e4ge, 1862, p. XIV.</ref>\n\nWundt attempted to redefine and restructure the fields of psychology and philosophy.\n<ref>Fahrenberg: Wilhelm Wundt, 2011, S. 14\u201316.</ref><ref>Paul Ziche: Wissenschaftslandschaften um 1900: Philosophie, die Wissenschaften und der nichtreduktive Szientismus, 2008.</ref> \"Experimental psychology in the narrower sense and child psychology form individual psychology, while cultural and animal psychology are both parts of a general and comparative psychology\" <ref>Wundt 1902, p. 6.</ref>). None of his Leipzig assistants and hardly any textbook authors in the subsequent two generations have adopted Wundt's broad theoretical horizon, his demanding scientific theory or the multi-method approach. [[Oswald K\u00fclpe]] had already ruled cultural and animal psychology out.<ref>K\u00fclpe, 1893, p. 7ff.</ref>\n\nWhile the ''Principles of physiological Psychology'' met with worldwide resonance, Wundt's cultural psychology (ethno-psychology) appeared to have had a less widespread impact. But there are indications that [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Franz Boas]], among others, were influenced by it.<ref>Eckardt, 1997; Graumann, 2006.</ref> In his [[Totem and Taboo]], [[Sigmund Freud]] frequently quoted Wundt's cultural psychology. In its time, Wundt's Ethik received more reviews than almost any of his other main works. Most of the objections were ranged against his renouncing any ultimate transcendental ethical basis (God, the Absolute), as well as against his ideas regarding evolution, i.e. that ethical standards changed culturally in the course of human intellectual development. As Wundt did not describe any concrete ethical conflicts on the basis of examples and did not describe any social ethics in particular, his teachings with the general idea of humanism appear rather too abstract.\n\nThe ''XXII International Congress for Psychology in Leipzig in 1980'', i.e. on the hundredth jubilee of the initial founding of the Institute in 1879, stimulated a number of publications about Wundt, also in the US <ref>Wolfgang G. Bringmann, Ryan D. Tweney (Eds.): Wundt studies, 1980; Wolfgang G. Bringmann, Eckart Scheerer (Eds.): Wundt centennial issue, 1980, Volume 42, pp. 1\u2013189; Robert W. Rieber, David K. Robinson (Eds.): Wilhelm Wundt in history: The making of a scientific psychology, 2001.</ref> Very little productive research work has been carried out since then. While Wundt was occasionally mentioned in the centenary review of the founding of the ''German Society for Experimental Psychology'' 1904/2004, it was without the principal ideas of his psychology and philosophy of science.<ref>Thomas Rammsayer, Stefan Troche (Eds.): Reflexionen der Psychologie. 100 Jahre Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie. Bericht \u00fcber den 44. Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie in G\u00f6ttingen 2004. Hogrefe: G\u00f6ttingen 2005.</ref>\n\n=== Research on reception of his work ===\nLeipzig was a world-famous centre for the new psychology after 1874. There are various interpretations regarding why Wundt's influence after the turn of the century, i.e. during his lifetime, rapidly waned and from his position as founding father Wundt became almost an outsider. A survey was conducted on the basis of more than 200 contemporary and later sources: reviews and critiques of his publications (since 1858), references to Wundt's work in textbooks on psychology and the history of psychology (from 1883 to 2010), biographies, congress reports, praise on his decadal birthdays, obituaries and other texts. A range of scientific controversies were presented in detail.<ref name=\"Fahrenberg 2011\"/> Reasons for the distancing of Wundt and why some of his concepts have fallen into oblivion can be seen in his scientific work, in his philosophical orientation, in his didactics or in the person of Wundt himself:\n\n*Possibly the most important reason for Wundt's relatively low influence might lie in his highly ambitious epistemologically founded conception of psychology, in his theory of science and in the level of difficulty involved in his wide-ranging methodology.\n* Most psychologies in the subsequent generation appear to have a considerably simpler, less demanding, philosophical point-of-view instead of coordinated causal and teleological considerations embedded in multiple reference systems that consequently also demanded a multi-method approach. Thus instead of perspectivism and a change in perspective an apparently straightforward approach is preferred, i.e. research oriented upon either the natural sciences or the humanities.\n* Wundt's assistants and colleagues, many of whom were also personally close, did not take on the role of students and certainly not the role of interpreters. Oswald K\u00fclpe, Ernst Meumann, Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg or Felix Krueger did not want to, or could not, adequately reference Wundt's comprehensive scientific conception of psychology in their books, for example they almost entirely ignored Wundt's categories and epistemological principles, his strategies in comparison and interpretation, the discussions regarding Kant's in-depth criticism of methodology, and Wundt's neuropsychology. Nobody in this circle developed a creative continuation of Wundt's concepts. Krueger's inner distance to a scientific concept and the entire work of his predecessor cannot be overlooked.<ref>Felix Krueger: Er\u00f6ffnung des XIII. Kongresses. Die Lage der Seelenwissenschaft in der deutschen Gegenwart. In: Otto Klemm (Hrsg.): Bericht \u00fcber den XIII. Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychologie in Leipzig vom 16.\u201319.

Fischer, Jena  1934, pp. 6\u201336.</ref>  \n* Through his definition of \"soul\" as an actual process, Wundt gave up the metaphysical idea of a \"substantial carrier\"; his psychology without a soul was heavily criticized by several contemporary and later psychologists and philosophers.\n* Wundt exposed himself to criticism with his theoretical and experimental psychologically differentiated apperception psychology as opposed to elemental association psychology, and with his comprehensive research programme on a development theory of the human intellect, now seen as an interdisciplinary or trans-disciplinary project.\n\n=== Misunderstandings of basic terms and principles ===\nWundt's terminology also created difficulties because he had \u2013 from today's point-of-view \u2013 given some of his most important ideas unfortunate names so that there were constant misunderstandings. Examples include:<br />\n \n* ''physiological psychology'' \u2013 specifically not a scientific physiological psychology, because by writing the adjective with a small letter Wundt wanted to avoid this misunderstanding that still exists today; for him it was the use of physiological aids in experimental general psychology that mattered. \n* ''Self-observation'' \u2013 not naive introspection, but with training and experimental control of conditions.\n* ''Experiment'' \u2013 this was meant with reference to Francis Bacon \u2013 general, i.e. far beyond the scientific rules of the empirical sciences, so not necessarily a statistically evaluated laboratory experiment.<ref>Wundt: \u00dcber Ausfrageexperimente, 1907, p.&nbsp;301ff</ref> For Wundt psychological experimentation primarily served as a check of trained self-observation. \n* ''Element'' \u2013 not in the sense of the smallest structure, but as a smallest unit of the intended level under consideration, so that, for example, even the central nervous system could be an \"element\". \n* ''V\u00f6lkerpsychologie'' \u2013 cultural psychology \u2013 not ethnology.\n* ''Apperception'' \u2013 not just an increase in attention, but a central and multimodal synthesis. \n* ''Voluntaristic tendency, voluntarism'' \u2013 not an absolute metaphysical postulate, but a primary empirically-psychologically based accentuation of motivated action against the intellectualism and cognitivism of other psychologists.\n\nA representation of Wundt's psychology as \u2018natural science\u2019, \u2018element psychology\u2019 or \u2018dualistic\u2019 conceptions is evidence of enduring misunderstandings. It is therefore necessary to remember Wundt's expressly stated desire for uniformity and lack of contradiction, for the mutual supplementation of psychological perspectives. Wundt's more demanding, sometimes more complicated and relativizing, then again very precise style can also be difficult \u2013 even for today's German readers; a high level of linguistic competence is required. There are only English translations for very few of Wundt's work. In particular, the ''Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen Psychologie'' expanded into three volumes and the ten volumes of V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, all the books on philosophy and important essays on the theory of science remain untranslated.\n\nSuch shortcomings may explain many of the fundamental deficits and lasting misunderstandings in the Anglo-American reception of Wundt's work. Massive misconceptions about Wundt's work have been demonstrated by William James, Granville Stanley Hall, Edward Boring and Edward Titchener  as well as among many later authors. Titchener, a two-year resident of Wundt's lab and one of Wundt's most vocal advocates in the United States, is responsible for several English translations and mistranslations of Wundt's works that supported his own views and approach, which he termed \"structuralism\" and claimed was wholly consistent with Wundt's position.<br />\nAs Wundt's three-volume Logik und Wissenschaftslehre, i.e. his theory of science, also remains untranslated the close interrelationships between Wundt's empirical psychology and his epistemology and methodology, philosophy and ethics are also regularly missing, even if later collections describe individual facets of them.<ref>Bringmann et al., 1980.</ref> Blumenthal's assessment <ref>Arthur L. Blumenthal: Wilhelm Wundt \u2013 Problems of interpretation. In: W.G. Bringmann, E.D. Tweney. (Eds.). Wundt Studies. A Centennial Collection. Hogrefe, Toronto 1980, pp.&nbsp;435\u2013445.</ref> that \"American textbook accounts of Wundt now present highly inaccurate and mythological caricatures of the man and his work\" still appears to be true of most publications about Wundt.\nA highly contradictory picture emerges from any systematic research on his reception. On the one hand, the pioneer of experimental psychology and founder of modern psychology as a discipline is praised, on the other hand, his work is insufficiently tapped and appears to have had little influence. Misunderstandings and stereotypical evaluations continue into the present, even in some representations of the history of psychology and in textbooks. Wundt's entire work is investigated in a more focused manner in more recent assessments regarding the reception of Wundt, and his theory of science and his philosophy is included (Araujo, 2016; Danziger, 1983, 1990, 2001; Fahrenberg, 2011, 2015, 2016; J\u00fcttemann, 2006; Kim, 2016; van Rappard, 1980).\n\n=== Scientific controversies and criticisms ===\nLike other important psychologists and philosophers, Wundt was subject to ideological criticism, for example by authors of a more Christianity-based psychology, by authors with [[Materialism|materialistic]] and [[Positivism|positivistic]] scientific opinions, or from the point-of-view of [[Marxist-Leninist]] philosophy and social theory, as in Leipzig, [[German Democratic Republic]], up to 1990. \nWundt was involved in a number of scientific controversies or was responsible for triggering them:\n* the Wundt-Zeller controversy about the measurability of awareness processes,\n* the Wundt-Meumann controversy about the necessary scope of the scientific principles of applied psychology,\n* the Wundt-B\u00fchler controversy about the methodology of the psychology of thought,\n* the controversy about the psychology of elemental (passive-mechanic) association and integrative (self-active) apperception,\n* the controversy about [[empirio-criticism]], [[positivism]] and critical realism, and \n* the controversy about [[psychologism]].\n\nThere are many forms of criticism of Wundt's psychology, of his apperception psychology, of his motivation theory, of his version of psychophysical parallelism with its concept of \"mental causality\", his refutation of psychoanalytic speculation about the unconscious, or of his critical realism. A recurring criticism is that Wundt largely ignored the areas of psychology that he found less interesting, such as differential psychology, child psychology and educational psychology. In his cultural psychology there is no empirical social psychology because there were still no methods for investigating it at the time. Among his postgraduate students, assistants and other colleagues, however, were several important pioneers: differential psychology, \"mental measurement\" and intelligence testing (James McKeen Cattell, Charles Spearman), social psychology of group pocesses and the psychology of work (Walther Moede), applied psychology (Ernst Meumann, Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg), psychopathology, psychopharmacology and clinical diagnosis (Emil Kraepelin). Wundt further influenced many American psychologists to create psychology graduate programs.\n\n== Wundt's excellence==\n[[File: Wilhelm Wundt, Statue, Southwest University Chongqing, China.jpg|thumb|<center> Wilhelm Wundt <br>\nSouthwest University Chongqing, China </center>]]\nWundt developed the first comprehensive and uniform theory of the science of psychology. The special epistemological and methodological status of psychology is postulated in this wide-ranging conceptualization, characterized by his neurophysiological, psychological and philosophical work. The human as a thinking and motivated subject is not to be captured in the terms of the natural sciences. Psychology requires special categories and autonomous epistemological principles. It is, on the one hand, an empirical humanity but should not, on the other hand, ignore its physiological basis and philosophical assumptions. Thus a varied, multi-method approach is necessary: self-observation, experimentation, generic comparison and interpretation. Wundt demanded the ability and readiness to distinguish between perspectives and reference systems, and to understand the necessary supplementation of these reference systems in changes of perspective. He defined the field of psychology very widely and as interdisciplinary, and also explained just how indispensable is the epistemological-philosophical criticism of psychological theories and their philosophical prerequisites. Psychology should remain connected with philosophy in order to promote this critique of knowledge of the metaphysical presuppositions so widespread among psychologists.\n\nThe conceptual relationships within the complete works created over decades and continuously reworked have hardly been systematically investigated. The most important theoretical basis is the empirical-psychological theory of apperception, based on Leibniz's philosophical position, that Wundt, on the one hand, based on experimental psychology and his neuropsychological modelling and, on the other hand, extrapolated into a development theory for culture. The fundamental reconstruction of Wundt's main ideas is a task that cannot be achieved by any one person today due to the complexity of the complete works. He tried to connect the fundamental controversies of the research directions epistemologically and methodologically by means of a co-ordinated concept \u2013 in a confident handling of the categorically basically different ways of considering the interrelations. Here, during the founding phase of university psychology, he already argued for a highly demanding meta-science meta-scientific reflection \u2013 and this potential to stimulate [[interdisciplinarity]] und [[perspectivism]] (complementary approaches) has by no means been exhausted.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n===Books and articles===\n* Lehre von der Muskelbewegung (The Patterns of Muscular Movement), (Vieweg, Braunschweig 1858).\n* Die Geschwindigkeit des Gedankens (The Velocity of Thought), (Die Gartenlaube 1862, Vol 17, p.&nbsp;263).\n* Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception), (Winter, Leipzig 1862).\n* Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Menschen- und Tierseele (Lectures about Human and Animal Psychology), (Voss, Leipzig Part 1 and 2, 1863/1864; 4th revised ed. 1906).\n* Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen (Textbook of Human Physiology), (Enke, Erlangen 1864/1865, 4th ed. 1878).\n* Die physikalischen Axiome und ihre Beziehung zum Causalprincip (Physical Axioms and their Bearing upon Causality Principles), (Enke, Erlangen 1866).\n* Handbuch der medicinischen Physik (Handbook of Medical Physics), (Enke, Erlangen 1867).

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=45}} The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Brook|2010|p=127}} The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}} The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.{{efn|group=note|\"The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan's terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty's conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (however theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.\"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}}}\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].{{sfn|Shepard|2006|p=19}} Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute. It is often argued that a [[Rus' Khaganate]] modelled on the Khazarian state had formed to the east, and that the Varangian chieftain of the coalition appropriated the title of qa\u011fan (''khagan'') as early as the 830s: the title survived to denote the princes of [[Kievan Rus']], whose capital, [[Kiev]], is often associated with a Khazarian foundation.{{sfn|Petrukhin|2007|p=245}}{{sfn|Noonan|2001|p=81}}{{efn|group=note|{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=243\u2013252}} argues however that:''The title of qaghan, with its claims to lordship over the steppe world, is likely to be no more than ideological booty from the 965 victory.''}}{{efn|group=note|{{harvnb|Korobkin|1998|p=xxvii}} citing {{harvnb|Golb|Pritsak|1982|p=15}} notes that Khazars have often been connected with Kiev's foundations.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.{{sfn|Mako|2010|p=45}} The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].{{sfn|Brook|2010|p=127}} The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.{{sfn|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}} Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.{{sfn|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}} The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.{{efn|group=note|\"The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan's terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty's conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (however theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.\"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}}}\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].{{sfn|Shepard|2006|p=19}} Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',{{sfn|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}} and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

It is located along the [[South Saskatchewan River]]. It is approximately {{cvt|169|km}} east of [[Lethbridge]] and {{cvt|295|km}} southeast of [[Calgary]]. This city and the adjacent Town of [[Redcliff, Alberta|Redcliff]] to the northwest are within  [[Cypress County]]. Medicine Hat was the [[List of cities in Alberta|sixth-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,230.\n\nStarted as a railway town, today Medicine Hat is served by the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]]) and the eastern terminus of the [[Crowsnest Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]]).  Nearby communities considered part of the Medicine Hat area include the Town of Redcliff (abutting the city's northwest boundary) and the hamlets of [[Desert Blume]], [[Dunmore, Alberta|Dunmore]], [[Irvine, Alberta|Irvine]], [[Seven Persons]], and [[Veinerville]].

Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] and the [[Cree]] in which a retreating Cree \"Medicine Man\" lost his headdress in the [[South Saskatchewan River]].\n\nA number of natural factors have always made Medicine Hat a gathering place. The gently sloping valley with its converging waterways and hardy native [[Populus|cottonwood]] trees attracted both the migratory [[American bison|bison]] herds which passed through the area, and humans who used the waterways and hunted the bison. Before Europeans arrived, the historic Blackfoot, Cree and [[Assiniboine]] nations used the area for hundreds of years, but they had been preceded for thousands of years by previous indigenous cultures.\n\nBeginning in 1971, archeological excavations supervised by scholars from [[Medicine Hat College]] (MHC) were conducted at what became known as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the [[Old Women's Phase]] to archeologists. They found \"quantities of stone tools, fire cracked rock, butchered bone and pottery\", marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They \"excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate the Saamis Site was initially occupied about AD 1500 and again around AD 1750\",<ref name=\"milne\">[https://www.mhc.ab.ca/alumni/real/real50/8_archaeology Dr. Laurie Milne, \"Uncovering Medicine Hat's history\"]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Medicine Hat College website, 2010</ref> well before most European contact.\n\nAlso in this area, further to the west, other MHC students and faculty were part of an excavation in 2000 at what became known as the Hillside Campsite, where two layers of finds were made. The upper layer had artifacts from the Old Women's Phase, but the lower layers were found to be much older, containing [[Pelican Lake Phase]] remains that were dated to between 1000 and 1500 BC.<ref name=\"milne\"/>\n\n=== Modern founding ===\n[[File:Medicine Hat Station 1906 0664-0001.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian Pacific Railway Station (1906)]]\nIn 1883, when the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) reached Medicine Hat and crossed the river, European Canadians established a town site. They named it from the [[First Nations]] legends. As growth took place, in 1889 Medicine Hat built the first hospital west of [[Winnipeg]]. The CPR established this town as a railway  [[divisional point]]. The frontier settlement was incorporated as a town on October 31, 1898, and as a city on May 9, 1906. Medicine Hat is halfway between Winnipeg and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast.\n\n=== Progress and growth ===\nRich in natural resources including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and was known in its early days as \"the [[Pittsburgh]] of the West\", referring to the industrial city in western Pennsylvania of the United States. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, pottery and glass bottle manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909\u20131914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.\n\nDuring World War II, one of the largest [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s (P.O.W.) in Canada was established here in the mid-1940s, used primarily to hold German and Italian prisoners. It was not until the 1950s of the post-war period that the town again had commercial growth.\n\nIn the 21st century, Medicine Hat promotes its quality of life and affordable cost of living, enjoying the savings of a city-owned gas utility and power generation plant. Major industries have included chemical plants, a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s),<ref>[http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile \"I-XL Industries Acquired by Friends of Medalta in Hope of Preserving Medicine Hat's Industrial Heritage\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709030954/http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile |date=July 9, 2013 }}</ref> to name a few. Friends of Medalta is a non-profit that has been formed to preserve some of the city's industrial heritage.\n\n[[File:Medicine Hat Teepee at Night, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Teepee at night]]\n[[File:Medicine Hat Speedway Derby, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Speedway Derby]]\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Medicine Hat landscape is dominated by the South Saskatchewan River valley. In addition, the tributaries Seven Persons Creek and Ross Creek both flow into the South Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the city. These waterways have cut a dramatic valley landscape with numerous cliffs, and finger [[coulee]]s throughout the city. Beyond the city and river valley, the land is flat to slightly rolling and is characterized by short-grass vegetation.\n\nLocated about {{cvt|40|km}} to the east at {{Coord|50|0|38.2|N|110|6|48.3|W|scale:7500|name=Badlands Guardian}} lies the [[Badlands Guardian|Badlands Guardian Geological Feature]].

He had purchased the land and a team of horses for $40.00 in 1895. The family kept the property for three generations, using part of it as a campground in the early 20th century. In 1930, they built the Maple Leaf motel on the property to generate some income. In 1990 a local family bought the property. With a view toward keeping the prominent property as part of the community, they adapted it as the Saamis Memorial Funeral Chapel & Crematorium.\n\nNow named the ''Saamis Teepee'', this work of public art is the world's tallest [[Tipi|teepee]]. It was installed in 1991 south of the Trans-Canada Highway and at the edge of the Blackfoot [[buffalo jump]], above the Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek. Commissioned for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]] as a symbol of Canada's Plains Indians, it stood {{cvt|215| feet}} high (more than 20 storeys) and is {{cvt|160| feet}} in diameter at the base. The sculpture was designed by Steve Illes of steel and concrete. He had the teepee painted \"white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun, and blue for flowing waters\". Within the teepee are ten circles, with painted illustrations that express ideas about the cultures of the Plains tribes. Explanation are on plaques set in the base.<ref name=\"peters\">[http://hammersonpeters.com/?p=500 \"The Saamis Tepee\"], in ''The Great White North'', Hammerson Peters website</ref>\n\nAlthough designed to withstand extreme temperatures and winds up to {{cvt|240|km/h}}, during a severe windstorm in January 2007, a portion of the teepee was damaged. Inspection revealed that extensive weathering had weakened the structure. The necessary repairs resulted in lowering the height of Saamis Teepee by approximately {{cvt|15|ft}}.\n\n=== Parks ===\nThere are over {{cvt|100|km}} of walking trails in the city.

It is located along the [[South Saskatchewan River]]. It is approximately {{cvt|169|km}} east of [[Lethbridge]] and {{cvt|295|km}} southeast of [[Calgary]]. This city and the adjacent Town of [[Redcliff, Alberta|Redcliff]] to the northwest are within  [[Cypress County]]. Medicine Hat was the [[List of cities in Alberta|sixth-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,230.\n\nStarted as a railway town, today Medicine Hat is served by the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]]) and the eastern terminus of the [[Crowsnest Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]]).  Nearby communities considered part of the Medicine Hat area include the Town of Redcliff (abutting the city's northwest boundary) and the hamlets of [[Desert Blume]], [[Dunmore, Alberta|Dunmore]], [[Irvine, Alberta|Irvine]], [[Seven Persons]], and [[Veinerville]]. The [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] (including [[Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park]]) is a relatively short distance (by car) to the southeast of the city.\n\nHistorically, Medicine Hat has been known for its large [[natural gas]] fields, being immortalized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] as having \"all hell for a basement\".<ref>{{Citation| last=Brennan| first=Brian| year=2003| title=Boondoggles, Bonanzas, and Other Alberta Stories| publisher=Fifth House| isbn=1-894004-94-9 |page=43 |quote=This part of the country seems to have all hell for a basement, and the only trap door appears to be in Medicine Hat.

Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] and the [[Cree]] in which a retreating Cree \"Medicine Man\" lost his headdress in the [[South Saskatchewan River]].\n\nA number of natural factors have always made Medicine Hat a gathering place. The gently sloping valley with its converging waterways and hardy native [[Populus|cottonwood]] trees attracted both the migratory [[American bison|bison]] herds which passed through the area, and humans who used the waterways and hunted the bison. Before Europeans arrived, the historic Blackfoot, Cree and [[Assiniboine]] nations used the area for hundreds of years, but they had been preceded for thousands of years by previous indigenous cultures.\n\nBeginning in 1971, archeological excavations supervised by scholars from [[Medicine Hat College]] (MHC) were conducted at what became known as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the [[Old Women's Phase]] to archeologists. They found \"quantities of stone tools, fire cracked rock, butchered bone and pottery\", marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They \"excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits.

The upper layer had artifacts from the Old Women's Phase, but the lower layers were found to be much older, containing [[Pelican Lake Phase]] remains that were dated to between 1000 and 1500 BC.<ref name=\"milne\"/>\n\n=== Modern founding ===\n[[File:Medicine Hat Station 1906 0664-0001.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian Pacific Railway Station (1906)]]\nIn 1883, when the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) reached Medicine Hat and crossed the river, European Canadians established a town site. They named it from the [[First Nations]] legends. As growth took place, in 1889 Medicine Hat built the first hospital west of [[Winnipeg]]. The CPR established this town as a railway  [[divisional point]]. The frontier settlement was incorporated as a town on October 31, 1898, and as a city on May 9, 1906. Medicine Hat is halfway between Winnipeg and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast.\n\n=== Progress and growth ===\nRich in natural resources including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and was known in its early days as \"the [[Pittsburgh]] of the West\", referring to the industrial city in western Pennsylvania of the United States. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, pottery and glass bottle manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909\u20131914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.\n\nDuring World War II, one of the largest [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s (P.O.W.) in Canada was established here in the mid-1940s, used primarily to hold German and Italian prisoners. It was not until the 1950s of the post-war period that the town again had commercial growth.\n\nIn the 21st century, Medicine Hat promotes its quality of life and affordable cost of living, enjoying the savings of a city-owned gas utility and power generation plant. Major industries have included chemical plants, a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s),<ref>[http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile \"I-XL Industries Acquired by Friends of Medalta in Hope of Preserving Medicine Hat's Industrial Heritage\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709030954/http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile |date=July 9, 2013 }}</ref> to name a few. Friends of Medalta is a non-profit that has been formed to preserve some of the city's industrial heritage.\n\n[[File:Medicine Hat Teepee at Night, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Teepee at night]]\n[[File:Medicine Hat Speedway Derby, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Speedway Derby]]\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Medicine Hat landscape is dominated by the South Saskatchewan River valley. In addition, the tributaries Seven Persons Creek and Ross Creek both flow into the South Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the city. These waterways have cut a dramatic valley landscape with numerous cliffs, and finger [[coulee]]s throughout the city. Beyond the city and river valley, the land is flat to slightly rolling and is characterized by short-grass vegetation.\n\nLocated about {{cvt|40|km}} to the east at {{Coord|50|0|38.2|N|110|6|48.3|W|scale:7500|name=Badlands Guardian}} lies the [[Badlands Guardian|Badlands Guardian Geological Feature]].

He had purchased the land and a team of horses for $40.00 in 1895. The family kept the property for three generations, using part of it as a campground in the early 20th century. In 1930, they built the Maple Leaf motel on the property to generate some income. In 1990 a local family bought the property. With a view toward keeping the prominent property as part of the community, they adapted it as the Saamis Memorial Funeral Chapel & Crematorium.\n\nNow named the ''Saamis Teepee'', this work of public art is the world's tallest [[Tipi|teepee]]. It was installed in 1991 south of the Trans-Canada Highway and at the edge of the Blackfoot [[buffalo jump]], above the Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek. Commissioned for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]] as a symbol of Canada's Plains Indians, it stood {{cvt|215| feet}} high (more than 20 storeys) and is {{cvt|160| feet}} in diameter at the base. The sculpture was designed by Steve Illes of steel and concrete. He had the teepee painted \"white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun, and blue for flowing waters\". Within the teepee are ten circles, with painted illustrations that express ideas about the cultures of the Plains tribes. Explanation are on plaques set in the base.<ref name=\"peters\">[http://hammersonpeters.com/?p=500 \"The Saamis Tepee\"], in ''The Great White North'', Hammerson Peters website</ref>\n\nAlthough designed to withstand extreme temperatures and winds up to {{cvt|240|km/h}}, during a severe windstorm in January 2007, a portion of the teepee was damaged. Inspection revealed that extensive weathering had weakened the structure. The necessary repairs resulted in lowering the height of Saamis Teepee by approximately {{cvt|15|ft}}.\n\n=== Parks ===\nThere are over {{cvt|100|km}} of walking trails in the city.

Currently the SALH has members serving in Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the First World War the [[175th (Medicine Hat) Battalion, CEF]], commanded by [[Nelson Spencer]], was a unit in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nMedicine Hat was also home to a [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] airfield (located at the present airport) and a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp (located at the present Exhibition & Stampede grounds) during the Second World War.\n\n[[CFB Suffield|Canadian Forces Base Suffield]] is located {{cvt|50|km}} west of the city. It is estimated that the base contributes C$120 million annually to the local economy, principally through its two lodger units: [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]], and [[Defence Research and Development Canada]] \u2013 Suffield).\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Terri Clark]], country singer\n* [[Amanda Cook (singer)|Amanda (Falk) Cook]], singer and worship leader with [[Bethel Music]] and winner of eight GMA [[Covenant Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=2094|title=Amanda Cook Artist Profile}}</ref>\n*[[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]], test pilot for the [[United States Air Force]] and the namesake of [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[southern California]].\n* [[Jurgen Gothe]], radio broadcaster<ref name=understands>\"Gothe understands the magic of his medium\".
