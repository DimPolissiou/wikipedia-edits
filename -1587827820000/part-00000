Her father has never been referred to in any way.\n\nShe graduated from Chesapeake Bay University with a B.A. in Criminal Justice<ref>\"Annihilator,\" Season 13 Episode 15</ref> and then from [[Yale University]] before joining the FBI, and had worked at its field offices in the Midwest before coming to the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). Prentiss is extremely well travelled due to her upbringing as an ambassador's daughter and her previous assignments while at [[Interpol]]. She is fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]],<ref>\"Lessons Learned,\" Season 2 Episode 10</ref> [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]],<ref>\"Lauren\" Season 6 Episode 18</ref> [[Italian language|Italian]],<ref name=\"demonology\" /> [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>\"Honor Among Thieves,\" Season 2 Episode 20</ref>\n\nPrentiss first appeared in the season two episode \"The Last Word.\" Her appearance surprised both SSA [[Aaron Hotchner]] and [[Jason Gideon]], as neither supervisor had signed off on the transfer. Hotchner was immediately suspicious of the new agent, but Prentiss, insisting that her mother had not pulled any strings for her to get the assignment, convinced him to let her join the team on a probationary basis, and eventually proved her competence and gained the team's trust.\n\nPrentiss was originally written as a lesbian and had a storyline where she woke up in bed next to a woman, which the creative team and Brewster were on board for, but CBS reportedly nixed the idea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://booksboobstvshows.tumblr.com/post/122909549517/a-million-years-ago-when-paget-was-still-on-the|title=<p>A million years ago when Paget was still on the show, they came up with this storyline that Paget's character was gonna like, get up out of bed, and there was gonna be a woman in bed with her, and...|website=You Gotta Have An Aquafina Man Mindset|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/416813-afterellens-podcast-lets-process-episode-five-kirsten-vangsness|title=AfterEllen's podcast \"Let's Process\" Episode Five: Kirsten Vangsness - AfterEllen|date=2015-02-23|work=AfterEllen|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}</ref> In a 2016 interview, following Brewster's return to the show, she stated that she would still \"be happy to play Emily as bisexual or gay.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://criminalmindsfans.com/exclusive-interview-paget-brewster-on-coming-home-emilys-future/|title=*EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW* Paget Brewster on Coming Home, Emily's Future!|website=criminalmindsfans.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29|date=2016-11-21}}</ref>\n\nPrentiss confided to [[David Rossi]] that she struggled to fit in as a teen, since she moved around so often, and would do \"almost anything\" to fit in. She told Rossi that during her mother's diplomatic posting in Italy, she got pregnant at 15 and had an abortion. She also states that the friend who accompanied her to the clinic \"saved [her] life.\"<ref name=\"demonology\">\"Demonology,\" Season 4 Episode 17</ref>\n\n==Relationships with colleagues==\n[[File:Criminal Minds scene (Season 6).jpg|thumb|250px|Paget Brewster (third from the right) filming in 2010]]\nInitially upon joining the BAU, Prentiss feels like an outsider and often worries that people doubt her ability as a profiler. Over time, Prentiss proves herself through her sharp profiling skills, competence, and dedication to the work, gradually earning the trust and respect of her fellow BAU team members.\n\nPrentiss has a good relationship with her supervisor [[Aaron Hotchner]] and establishes herself as one of the most reliable and capable agents on the BAU. Hotchner had previously worked as the Head of Security for Prentiss's Ambassador mother, Elizabeth Prentiss, but did not cross paths with Prentiss, because she was off to [[Yale]]. When she joins the BAU, they get off to a rocky start, but after a confrontation in his office about her feelings and opinions regarding politics and after she resigns instead of secretly feeding reports to Section Chief Erin Strauss, Hotchner begins to understand Prentiss and trust her more. Before leaving to be with the BAU on a case despite his suspension from the field, Hotchner stops by Prentiss' apartment to convince her to get on the plane with him to help their team catch the UNSUB.\n\nIn \"52 Pickup,\" Hotchner is seen asking Prentiss for advice on how to deal with JJ's temporary substitute, Agent Jordan Todd, and acts on her suggestions, even giving Agent Todd another chance to prove herself.\n\nFor the most part, Prentiss has also developed friendly relationships with the other members of the BAU team.\n\nPrentiss immediately bonds with Agent [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds character)|Derek Morgan]] due to their mutual love of [[Kurt Vonnegut]] books and they develop a close relationship. Their strong bond is most evident in the episodes leading up to and after Prentiss' death. Morgan is able to detect that Prentiss is worried about something and tries to get her to tell him what is bothering her. He also feels betrayed when Prentiss does not reveal the extent of her involvement with Doyle and the case and assumes she does not trust him enough. Rossi later tries to reason with him that Prentiss is merely trying to protect the BAU team. Morgan is also with Prentiss, holding her, when she is dying after being seriously injured by Doyle, and tells her that he understands what she did, and that she is brave, and he is proud of her. When he believes she has died, Morgan takes her death quite hard and expresses anger toward Doyle. When Emily returns to the BAU in season 7, Morgan shows concern for her safety and ability to protect herself in the field by making her sign up for re-certification.\n\nOver time, she also forms a close relationship with Agent [[Jennifer Jareau|Jennifer \"JJ\" Jareau]], especially when they are the only two female agents in the BAU in the field for several seasons. When Prentiss has to fake her death for the team's safety, JJ is the only one (aside from Hotchner) who knows the truth. JJ also flies to Paris and is involved in getting fake passports and setting up bank accounts for Prentiss to stay incognito. JJ expresses the most happiness when Prentiss came back from the dead and tells Prentiss how much she has missed her while she was gone. Prentiss later mentions to Hotchner that while she was away from the BAU and work, she played a lot of online [[Scrabble]] with someone with the online moniker \"cheetobreath\", implying it was JJ keeping her company. In the rare moments outside work, JJ and Prentiss have been seen having conversations about children and the men, or lack thereof, in Prentiss's life. Prentiss was also the first to congratulate JJ when she revealed she was pregnant with Henry.\n\nAfter [[Spencer Reid]] returns to work following his abduction by serial killer Tobias Hankel, Prentiss experiences a falling out with the young agent due to his harsh behavior toward her (a function of the irritability resulting from Reid's use of narcotics to cope with his recent trauma). However, the agents eventually gain a mutual respect and even share light-hearted moments. Prentiss sometimes joins in with Morgan in good-natured teasing of Reid's genius. She also amazes Reid when she beats him at poker even though he is from Las Vegas and never loses. Another turning point in their relationship is when Prentiss and Reid are held captive by a cult group and Prentiss admits she is the FBI agent, causing her to suffer a beating from the cult leader. As a result, Reid feels guilty, but Prentiss reassures him everything is all right and that is not his fault. Prentiss is also the only one Reid tells about his recurring headaches. Reid is one of the most affected by Prentiss' death, sobbing on JJ's shoulder because he never got to say goodbye, and even thought about giving up since he felt the BAU had failed at protecting a member of their team. Later, when Prentiss comes back, Reid feels betrayed by Prentiss for not telling him the truth, but Prentiss confronts him and they eventually reconcile.\n\nPrentiss is often seen hanging out with Jareau and Technical Analyst [[Penelope Garcia]] outside of work. Garcia looks up to Prentiss and never fails to vocalize her admiration, whether it is for Prentiss' fluency in Arabic, wit or the fact she took up salsa dancing classes. Garcia also notes that after four years with the team, Prentiss is a part of the \u201cBAU family;\u201d they hold a close friendship.\n\n==On the job==\nPrentiss is shown to be an extremely competent, level-headed agent. She is not as affected by the nightmares that come with the job and manages to keep her cool in hostile confrontations. She is also shown to put herself in the line of fire, for example, volunteering to enter into the unsub's house to rescue his young boy, and sacrifice herself for her teammates, as she did for [[Spencer Reid]] once in the season 4 episode, \"Minimal Loss.\" She does not act rashly and there was only one rare occasion where she allowed her personal feelings interfere with investigations.<ref name=\"demonology\" /> It has been mentioned by Morgan that she has problems trusting others, preferring to handle things independently instead of asking others to help, but it was revealed that this reluctance is due to her long background as an undercover agent.\n\n===Ian Doyle and \"Death\"===\nIn the sixth season, Agent Prentiss is notified by her former superiors at [[Interpol]] that a man named Ian Doyle has escaped from prison in [[North Korea]]. Later, after returning home from work, Prentiss receives several hang-up calls on her home phone from an unknown caller. Upon her return home on a subsequent night, she finds an anonymous gift on her doorstep, containing a single purple flower. She experiences a flashback to a past undercover job in Italy, during which she was acting as his girlfriend and observing Doyle. Recognizing that the gift of the purple flower means Doyle knows where she lives, Prentiss flees. In \"Coda,\" Prentiss enlists two former Interpol colleagues in hunting Doyle. In \u201cValhalla,\u201d Tsia Mosely, one of her [[Interpol]] colleagues, gets shot in the head by Doyle while visiting someone.<ref>\"Valhalla,\" Season 6 Episode 17</ref> At the end of that episode, Prentiss sneaks out of a meeting in order to save her BAU colleagues from Doyle.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Lauren,\" it is revealed that Prentiss had been a spy eight years previously, on a task force profiling terrorists; while undercover, she met Ian Doyle (an arms dealer) and became his lover. Her betrayal of Doyle led to his arrest and subsequent imprisonment, including time in a North Korean prison. Prentiss tracks down Doyle in Boston and tries to kill him, but he takes her hostage. Later, Rossi realized that she left their team meeting suddenly in order to protect them from Doyle as it was Prentiss that Doyle was after. Hotch says they will treat Doyle as an unsub and Prentiss as his victim, and profile them just as they would in any other case.\n\nThey eventually track them down to an abandoned building in Boston and arrive with a SWAT team. Prentiss reveals to Doyle that his son, whom Doyle believed had been killed, is actually alive, and that she staged photos of executing the boy in order to get Doyle to break under interrogation in North Korea. After an intense fight, Doyle manages to stab Prentiss in the abdomen with a broken table leg. Even though she is dying, she refuses to tell him where his son is hiding, and Doyle escapes shortly before Morgan reaches her. In the hospital, the BAU team is notified that Prentiss has died. They are seen attending her funeral. The last scene, however, reveals she is alive and in Paris, where JJ meets her and gives her an envelope with \"passports from three different countries, and a bank account in each one to keep [her] comfortable.\"\n\n===Returning to the BAU===\nIn the season seven premiere, Morgan captures Doyle and Emily returns to the BAU to assist the team in finding who kidnapped Doyle's son, Declan.<ref>\"It Takes a Village,\" Season 7 Episode 1</ref> The team comes under fire from the judiciary panel for their retaliatory actions to avenge Prentiss' death, but everyone stands their ground to protect the team. Section Chief Erin Strauss later reveals to them that the committee was persuaded by Prentiss' defense and eventually decided to lift the BAU's suspensions although they will still be \"keeping a close eye\" on the members. Reid, who is still angry over her 'death' refuses to speak to her or JJ or even look them in the eye. At the end of \"Proof,\" Prentiss talks it through with him and they make amends.<ref>\"Proof,\" Season 7 Episode 2</ref> In the premiere it is also revealed that Garcia has been taking care of her cat, Sergio, and when she inquires about him, Garcia jokingly states that she wants visitation rights.\n\nIn the season seven finale, Prentiss receives an offer to run [[Interpol]]'s [[London]] office. While still pondering her decision on the offer, Prentiss decides to leave the BAU. In the season eight premiere, Morgan and Garcia mention seeing her while they were in London and that Emily is doing fine.\n\nBrewster returned for guest appearances in the season 9 episode \"[[200 (Criminal Minds)|200]]\" in 2014 and the season 11 episode \"Tribute\" in early 2016 before returning as a regular cast member in the season 12 episode \"Taboo\" later in the year.<ref>\"Taboo,\" Season 12, Episode 3</ref>\n\nShe is now the Unit Chief of the BAU, following the departure of [[Aaron Hotchner]].<ref>\"Elliot's Pond,\" Season 12, Episode 6</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Criminal Minds}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prentiss, Emily}}\n[[Category:Criminal Minds characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional Behavioral Analysis Unit agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Fictional linguists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Character in American television series Criminal Minds}}\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Emily Prentiss\n|image = Emily Prentiss.jpg\n|caption = [[Paget Brewster]] as Emily Prentiss\n|series = [[Criminal Minds]]\n|portrayer = [[Paget Brewster]]\n|creator = [[Edward Allen Bernero]]\n|first = \"[[Criminal Minds (season 2)|The Last Word]]\"<br>2x09, November 15, 2006\n|last =  \"[[Criminal Minds (season 15)|And in the End]]\"<br>15x10, February 19, 2020\n|occupation = Chief of the London Interpol Office (Former)\n|title = FBI [[Behavioral Analysis Unit|BAU]] Supervisory Special Agent<br>FBI [[Behavioral Analysis Unit|BAU]] Unit Chief\n| lbl24 = Seasons\n| data24 = [[Criminal Minds (season 2)|2]], [[Criminal Minds (season 3)|3]], [[Criminal Minds (season 4)|4]], [[Criminal Minds (season 5)|5]], [[Criminal Minds (season 6)|6]], [[Criminal Minds (season 7)|7]], [[Criminal Minds (season 9)|9]], [[Criminal Minds (season 11)|11]], [[Criminal Minds (season 12)|12]], [[Criminal Minds (season 13)|13]], [[Criminal Minds (season 14)|14]], [[Criminal Minds (season 15)|15]]\n|family = Unnamed father<br />Elizabeth Prentiss<br />(mother)<br />Andrew Mendoza<br />(boyfriend) \n|nicknames = Emily, Em, Prentiss, Princess \n|alias = Lauren Reynolds\n}}\n'''Emily Prentiss''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[CBS]] [[police procedural|crime drama]] ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', portrayed by [[Paget Brewster]].

Reid is one of the most affected by Prentiss' death, sobbing on JJ's shoulder because he never got to say goodbye, and even thought about giving up since he felt the BAU had failed at protecting a member of their team. Later, when Prentiss comes back, Reid feels betrayed by Prentiss for not telling him the truth, but Prentiss confronts him and they eventually reconcile.\n\nPrentiss is often seen hanging out with Jareau and Technical Analyst [[Penelope Garcia]] outside of work. Garcia looks up to Prentiss and never fails to vocalize her admiration, whether it is for Prentiss' fluency in Arabic, wit or the fact she took up salsa dancing classes. Garcia also notes that after four years with the team, Prentiss is a part of the \u201cBAU family;\u201d they hold a close friendship.\n\n==On the job==\nPrentiss is shown to be an extremely competent, level-headed agent. She is not as affected by the nightmares that come with the job and manages to keep her cool in hostile confrontations. She is also shown to put herself in the line of fire, for example, volunteering to enter into the unsub's house to rescue his young boy, and sacrifice herself for her teammates, as she did for [[Spencer Reid]] once in the season 4 episode, \"Minimal Loss.\" She does not act rashly and there was only one rare occasion where she allowed her personal feelings interfere with investigations.<ref name=\"demonology\" /> It has been mentioned by Morgan that she has problems trusting others, preferring to handle things independently instead of asking others to help, but it was revealed that this reluctance is due to her long background as an undercover agent.\n\n===Ian Doyle and \"Death\"===\nIn the sixth season, Agent Prentiss is notified by her former superiors at [[Interpol]] that a man named Ian Doyle has escaped from prison in [[North Korea]]. Later, after returning home from work, Prentiss receives several hang-up calls on her home phone from an unknown caller. Upon her return home on a subsequent night, she finds an anonymous gift on her doorstep, containing a single purple flower. She experiences a flashback to a past undercover job in Italy, during which she was acting as his girlfriend and surveiling Doyle. Recognizing that the gift of the purple flower means Doyle knows where she lives, Prentiss flees. In \"Coda,\" Prentiss enlists two former Interpol colleagues in hunting Doyle. In \u201cValhalla,\u201d Tsia Mosely, one of her [[Interpol]] colleagues, gets shot in the head by Doyle while visiting someone.<ref>\"Valhalla,\" Season 6 Episode 17</ref> At the end of that episode, Prentiss sneaks out of a meeting in order to save her BAU colleagues from Doyle.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Lauren,\" it is revealed that Prentiss had been a spy eight years previously, on a task force profiling terrorists; while undercover, she met Ian Doyle (an arms dealer) and became his lover. Her betrayal of Doyle led to his arrest and subsequent imprisonment, including time in a North Korean prison. Prentiss tracks down Doyle in Boston and tries to kill him, but he takes her hostage. Later, Rossi realized that she left their team meeting suddenly in order to protect them from Doyle as it was Prentiss that Doyle was after. Hotch says they will treat Doyle as an unsub and Prentiss as his victim, and profile them just as they would in any other case.\n\nThey eventually track them down to an abandoned building in Boston and arrive with a SWAT team. Prentiss reveals to Doyle that his son, whom Doyle believed had been killed, is actually alive, and that she staged photos of executing the boy in order to get Doyle to break under interrogation in North Korea. After an intense fight, Doyle manages to stab Prentiss in the abdomen with a broken table leg. Even though she is dying, she refuses to tell him where his son is hiding, and Doyle escapes shortly before Morgan reaches her. In the hospital, the BAU team is notified that Prentiss has died. They are seen attending her funeral. The last scene, however, reveals she is alive and in Paris, where JJ meets her and gives her an envelope with \"passports from three different countries, and a bank account in each one to keep [her] comfortable.\"\n\n===Returning to the BAU===\nIn the season seven premiere, Morgan captures Doyle and Emily returns to the BAU to assist the team in finding who kidnapped Doyle's son, Declan.<ref>\"It Takes a Village,\" Season 7 Episode 1</ref> The team comes under fire from the judiciary panel for their retaliatory actions to avenge Prentiss' death, but everyone stands their ground to protect the team. Section Chief Erin Strauss later reveals to them that the committee was persuaded by Prentiss' defense and eventually decided to lift the BAU's suspensions although they will still be \"keeping a close eye\" on the members. Reid, who is still angry over her 'death' refuses to speak to her or JJ or even look them in the eye. At the end of \"Proof,\" Prentiss talks it through with him and they make amends.<ref>\"Proof,\" Season 7 Episode 2</ref> In the premiere it is also revealed that Garcia has been taking care of her cat, Sergio, and when she inquires about him, Garcia jokingly states that she wants visitation rights.\n\nIn the season seven finale, Prentiss receives an offer to run [[Interpol]]'s [[London]] office. While still pondering her decision on the offer, Prentiss decides to leave the BAU. In the season eight premiere, Morgan and Garcia mention seeing her while they were in London and that Emily is doing fine.\n\nBrewster returned for guest appearances in the season 9 episode \"[[200 (Criminal Minds)|200]]\" in 2014 and the season 11 episode \"Tribute\" in early 2016 before returning as a regular cast member in the season 12 episode \"Taboo\" later in the year.<ref>\"Taboo,\" Season 12, Episode 3</ref>\n\nShe is now the Unit Chief of the BAU, following the departure of [[Aaron Hotchner]].<ref>\"Elliot's Pond,\" Season 12, Episode 6</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Criminal Minds}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prentiss, Emily}}\n[[Category:Criminal Minds characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional Behavioral Analysis Unit agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Fictional linguists]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo found withWikipedia:Typo_Team/moss.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Prentiss"}

It is usually denoted by a symbol 1 or ''I'', sometimes in boldface or  [[blackboard bold]]face, with a subscript specifying the subset.\n\nIn other contexts, such as [[computer science]], this would more often be described as a '''boolean [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] function''' (to test set inclusion).\n\nThe [[Dirichlet function]] is an example of an indicator function and is the indicator of the [[rationals]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe indicator function of a subset ''A'' of a set ''X'' is a function\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_A \\colon X \\to \\{ 0,1 \\} </math>\n\ndefined as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_A(x) :=\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if } x \\in A, \\\\\n0 &\\text{if } x \\notin A.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe [[Iverson bracket]] allows the equivalent notation, <math>[x\\in A]</math>, to be used instead of <math>\\mathbf{1}_A(x)</math>.\n\nThe function <math>\\mathbf{1}_A</math> is sometimes denoted <math>I_A</math>, <math>\\chi_A</math>, ''K<sub>A</sub>'' or even just <math>A</math>. (The [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] <math>\\chi</math> appears because it is the initial letter of the Greek word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, which is the ultimate origin of the word ''characteristic''.)\n\nThe set of all indicator functions on <math>X</math> can be identified with <math>\\mathcal{P}(X)</math>, the [[power set]] of <math>X</math>.  Consequently, both sets are sometimes denoted by <math>2^X</math>. This is a special case (<math>Y =\\{0,1\\}=2</math>) of the notation <math>Y^X</math> for the set of all functions <math>f:X\\to Y </math>.\n\n==Remark on notation and terminology==\nThe notation <math>\\chi_A</math> is also used to denote the [[Characteristic function (convex analysis)|characteristic function]] in [[convex analysis]], which is defined as if using the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the standard definition of the indicator function.\n\nA related concept in [[statistics]] is that of a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. (This must not be confused with \"dummy variables\" as that term is usually used in mathematics, also called a [[free variables and bound variables|bound variable]].)\n\nThe term \"[[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]\" has an unrelated meaning in [[probability theory|classic probability theory]]. For this reason, [[List of probabilists|traditional probabilists]] use the term '''indicator function''' for the function defined here almost exclusively, while mathematicians in other fields are more likely to use the term ''characteristic function'' to describe the function that indicates membership in a set.\n\nIn [[fuzzy logic]] and [[Many-valued logic|modern many-valued logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.\n\n==Basic properties==\nThe ''indicator'' or ''characteristic'' [[function (mathematics)|function]] of a subset ''A'' of some set ''X'' [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] elements of ''X'' to the [[Range of a function|range]] {0, 1}.\n\nThis mapping is [[surjective]] only when ''A'' is a non-empty [[proper subset]] of ''X''. If ''A'' \u2261 ''X'', then\n'''1'''<sub>''A''</sub> = 1. By a similar argument, if ''A'' \u2261 \u00d8 then '''1'''<sub>''A''</sub> = 0.\n\nIn the following, the dot represents multiplication, 1\u00b71 = 1, 1\u00b70 = 0 etc. \"+\" and \"\u2212\" represent addition and subtraction. \"<math>\\cap </math>\" and \"<math>\\cup </math>\" is intersection and union, respectively.\n\nIf <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are two subsets of <math>X</math>, then\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_{A\\cap B} = \\min\\{\\mathbf{1}_A,\\mathbf{1}_B\\} = \\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot\\mathbf{1}_B,</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_{A\\cup B} = \\max\\{{\\mathbf{1}_A,\\mathbf{1}_B}\\} = \\mathbf{1}_A + \\mathbf{1}_B - \\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot\\mathbf{1}_B,</math>\nand the indicator function of the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of <math>A</math> i.e. <math>A^C</math> is:\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_{A^\\complement} = 1-\\mathbf{1}_A</math>.\n\nMore generally, suppose <math>A_1, \\dotsc, A_n</math> is a collection of subsets of ''X''.  For any\n''x'' \u2208 ''X'':\n\n:<math> \\prod_{k \\in I} ( 1 - \\mathbf{1}_{A_k}(x))</math>\n\nis clearly a product of 0s and 1s.  This product has the value 1 at\nprecisely those ''x'' \u2208 ''X'' that belong to none of the sets ''A<sub>k</sub>'' and\nis 0 otherwise. That is\n\n:<math> \\prod_{k \\in I} ( 1 - \\mathbf{1}_{A_k}) = \\mathbf{1}_{X - \\bigcup_{k} A_k} = 1 - \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcup_{k} A_k}.</math>\n\nExpanding the product on the left hand side,\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcup_{k} A_k}= 1 - \\sum_{F \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dotsc, n\\}} (-1)^{|F|} \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcap_F A_k} = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq F \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dotsc, n\\}} (-1)^{|F|+1} \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcap_F A_k} </math>\n\nwhere |''F''| is the cardinality of ''F''. This is one form of the principle of [[inclusion-exclusion]].\n\nAs suggested by the previous example, the indicator function is a useful notational device in [[combinatorics]].  The notation is used in other places as well, for instance in [[probability theory]]: if <math>X</math> is a [[probability space]] with probability measure <math>\\operatorname{P}</math> and <math>A</math> is a [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable set]], then <math>\\mathbf{1}_A</math> becomes a [[random variable]] whose [[expected value]] is equal to the probability of <math>A</math>:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}(\\mathbf{1}_A)= \\int_{X} \\mathbf{1}_A(x)\\,d\\operatorname{P} = \\int_{A} d\\operatorname{P} = \\operatorname{P}(A)</math>.\n\nThis identity is used in a simple proof of [[Markov's inequality]].\n\nIn many cases, such as [[order theory]], the inverse of the indicator function may be defined. This is commonly called the [[generalized M\u00f6bius function]], as a generalization of the inverse of the indicator function in elementary [[number theory]], the [[M\u00f6bius function]]. (See paragraph below about the use of the inverse in classical recursion theory.)\n\n==Mean, variance and covariance==\nGiven a [[probability space]] <math>\\textstyle (\\Omega, \\mathcal F, \\operatorname{P})</math> with <math>A \\in \\mathcal F</math>, the indicator random variable <math>\\mathbf{1}_A \\colon \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}</math> is defined by <math>\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega) = 1 </math> if <math> \\omega \\in A,</math> otherwise <math>\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega) = 0.</math>\n\n;[[Mean]]: <math>\\operatorname{E}(\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega)) = \\operatorname{P}(A) </math>\n\n;[[Variance]]: <math>\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega)) = \\operatorname{P}(A)(1 - \\operatorname{P}(A)) </math>\n\n;[[Covariance]]: <math> \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega), \\mathbf{1}_B (\\omega)) = \\operatorname{P}(A \\cap B) - \\operatorname{P}(A)\\operatorname{P}(B) </math>\n\n==Characteristic function in recursion theory, G\u00f6del's and Kleene's ''representing function''==\n[[Kurt G\u00f6del]] described the ''representing function'' in his 1934 paper \"On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems\". (The paper appears on pp.&nbsp;41\u201374 in [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable''):\n:\"There shall correspond to each class or relation R a representing function \u03c6(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>) = 0 if R(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>) and \u03c6(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>) = 1 if ~R(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>).\" (p. 42; the \"~\" indicates logical inversion i.e. \"NOT\")\n\n[[Stephen Kleene]] (1952) (p.&nbsp;227) offers up the same definition in the context of the [[primitive recursive function]]s as a function \u03c6 of a predicate P takes on values 0 if the predicate is true and 1 if the predicate is false.\n\nFor example, because the product of characteristic functions \u03c6<sub>1</sub>*\u03c6<sub>2</sub>* . . . *\u03c6<sub>n</sub> = 0 whenever any one of the functions equals 0, it plays the role of logical OR: IF \u03c6<sub>1</sub> = 0 OR \u03c6<sub>2</sub> = 0 OR . . . OR \u03c6<sub>n</sub> = 0 THEN their product is 0. What appears to the modern reader as the representing function's logical inversion, i.e. the representing function is 0 when the function R is \"true\" or satisfied\", plays a useful role in Kleene's definition of the logical  functions OR, AND, and IMPLY (p.&nbsp;228), the bounded- (p.&nbsp;228) and unbounded- (p.&nbsp;279ff) [[mu operator]]s (Kleene (1952)) and the CASE function (p.&nbsp;229).\n\n==Characteristic function in fuzzy set theory==\nIn classical mathematics, characteristic functions of sets only take values 1 (members) or 0 (non-members). In [[fuzzy set theory]], characteristic functions are generalized to take value in the real unit interval [0,&nbsp;1], or more generally, in some [[universal algebra|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (usually required to be at least a [[partially ordered set|poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Such generalized characteristic functions are more usually called [[membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]s, and the corresponding \"sets\" are called ''fuzzy'' sets. Fuzzy sets model the gradual change in the membership [[degree of truth|degree]] seen in many real-world [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]s like \"tall\", \"warm\", etc.\n\n==Derivatives of the indicator function==\n{{Main|Laplacian of the indicator}}\nA particular indicator function is the [[Heaviside step function]]. The Heaviside step function  ''H''(''x'') is the indicator function of the one-dimensional positive half-line, i.e. the domain [0, \u221e). The [[distributional derivative]] of the Heaviside step function is equal to the [[Dirac delta function]], i.e.\n\n:<math>\n\\delta(x)=\\tfrac{d H(x)}{dx},\n</math>\n\nwith the following property:\n\n:<math>\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\, \\delta(x) dx =  f(0).\n</math>\n\nThe derivative of the Heaviside step function can be seen as the 'inward normal derivative' at the 'boundary' of the domain given by the positive half-line. In higher dimensions, the derivative naturally generalises to the inward normal derivative, while the Heaviside step function naturally generalises to the indicator function of some domain ''D''. The surface of ''D'' will be denoted by ''S''. Proceeding, it can be derived that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] gives rise to a 'surface delta function', which can be indicated by \u03b4<sub>''S''</sub>('''x'''):\n\n:<math>\\delta_S(\\mathbf{x})=-\\mathbf{n}_x\\cdot\\nabla_x\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in D}</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' is the outward [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] of the surface ''S''. This 'surface delta function' has the following property:<ref>{{Citation |last=Lange |first=Rutger-Jan |title=Potential theory, path integrals and the Laplacian of the indicator |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=2012 |issue=11 |pages=29\u201330 |year=2012 |arxiv=1302.0864 |bibcode=2012JHEP...11..032L |doi=10.1007/JHEP11(2012)032}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n-\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n}f(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\mathbf{n}_x\\cdot\\nabla_x\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in D}\\;d^{n}\\mathbf{x}=\\oint_{S}\\,f(\\mathbf{\\beta})\\;d^{n-1}\\mathbf{\\beta}.\n</math>\n\nBy setting the function ''f'' equal to one, it follows that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] integrates to the numerical value of the [[surface area]] ''S''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Dirac measure]]\n* [[Laplacian of the indicator]]\n* [[Dirac delta]]\n* [[Extension (predicate logic)]]\n* [[Free variables and bound variables]]\n* [[Heaviside step function]]\n* [[Iverson bracket]]\n* [[Kronecker delta]], a function that can be viewed as an indicator for the [[Equality (mathematics)|identity relation]]\n* [[Macaulay brackets]]\n* [[Multiset]]\n* [[Membership function (mathematics)|Membership function]]\n* [[Simple function]]\n* [[Dummy variable (statistics)]]\n* [[Statistical classification]]\n* [[Zero-one loss function]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book |last=Folland |first=G.B. |title=Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-31716-6 |edition=Second}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Cormen |first=Thomas H. |title=Introduction to Algorithms |title-link=Introduction to Algorithms |last2=Leiserson |first2=Charles E. |last3=Rivest |first3=Ronald L. |last4=Stein |first4=Clifford |publisher=MIT Press and McGraw-Hill |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-262-03293-3 |edition=Second |pages=94\u201399 |chapter=Section 5.2: Indicator random variables |author-link=Thomas H.

For any\n''x'' \u2208 ''X'':\n\n:<math> \\prod_{k \\in I} ( 1 - \\mathbf{1}_{A_k}(x))</math>\n\nis clearly a product of 0s and 1s.  This product has the value 1 at\nprecisely those ''x'' \u2208 ''X'' that belong to none of the sets ''A<sub>k</sub>'' and\nis 0 otherwise. That is\n\n:<math> \\prod_{k \\in I} ( 1 - \\mathbf{1}_{A_k}) = \\mathbf{1}_{X - \\bigcup_{k} A_k} = 1 - \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcup_{k} A_k}.</math>\n\nExpanding the product on the left hand side,\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcup_{k} A_k}= 1 - \\sum_{F \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dotsc, n\\}} (-1)^{|F|} \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcap_F A_k} = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq F \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dotsc, n\\}} (-1)^{|F|+1} \\mathbf{1}_{\\bigcap_F A_k} </math>\n\nwhere |''F''| is the cardinality of ''F''. This is one form of the principle of [[inclusion-exclusion]].\n\nAs suggested by the previous example, the indicator function is a useful notational device in [[combinatorics]].  The notation is used in other places as well, for instance in [[probability theory]]: if <math>X</math> is a [[probability space]] with probability measure <math>\\operatorname{P}</math> and <math>A</math> is a [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable set]], then <math>\\mathbf{1}_A</math> becomes a [[random variable]] whose [[expected value]] is equal to the probability of <math>A</math>:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}(\\mathbf{1}_A)= \\int_{X} \\mathbf{1}_A(x)\\,d\\operatorname{P} = \\int_{A} d\\operatorname{P} = \\operatorname{P}(A)</math>.\n\nThis identity is used in a simple proof of [[Markov's inequality]].\n\nIn many cases, such as [[order theory]], the inverse of the indicator function may be defined. This is commonly called the [[generalized M\u00f6bius function]], as a generalization of the inverse of the indicator function in elementary [[number theory]], the [[M\u00f6bius function]]. (See paragraph below about the use of the inverse in classical recursion theory.)\n\n==Mean, variance and covariance==\nGiven a [[probability space]] <math>\\textstyle (\\Omega, \\mathcal F, \\operatorname{P})</math> with <math>A \\in \\mathcal F</math>, the indicator random variable <math>\\mathbf{1}_A \\colon \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}</math> is defined by <math>\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega) = 1 </math> if <math> \\omega \\in A,</math> otherwise <math>\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega) = 0.</math>\n\n;[[Mean]]: <math>\\operatorname{E}(\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega)) = \\operatorname{P}(A) </math>\n\n;[[Variance]]: <math>\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega)) = \\operatorname{P}(A)(1 - \\operatorname{P}(A)) </math>\n\n;[[Covariance]]: <math> \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbf{1}_A (\\omega), \\mathbf{1}_B (\\omega)) = \\operatorname{P}(A \\cap B) - \\operatorname{P}(A)\\operatorname{P}(B) </math>\n\n==Characteristic function in recursion theory, G\u00f6del's and Kleene's ''representing function''==\n[[Kurt G\u00f6del]] described the ''representing function'' in his 1934 paper \"On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems\". (The paper appears on pp.&nbsp;41\u201374 in [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable''):\n:\"There shall correspond to each class or relation R a representing function \u03c6(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>) = 0 if R(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>) and \u03c6(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>) = 1 if ~R(x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub>).\" (p. 42; the \"~\" indicates logical inversion i.e. \"NOT\")\n\n[[Stephen Kleene]] (1952) (p.&nbsp;227) offers up the same definition in the context of the [[primitive recursive function]]s as a function \u03c6 of a predicate P takes on values 0 if the predicate is true and 1 if the predicate is false.\n\nFor example, because the product of characteristic functions \u03c6<sub>1</sub>*\u03c6<sub>2</sub>* . . . *\u03c6<sub>n</sub> = 0 whenever any one of the functions equals 0, it plays the role of logical OR: IF \u03c6<sub>1</sub> = 0 OR \u03c6<sub>2</sub> = 0 OR . . . OR \u03c6<sub>n</sub> = 0 THEN their product is 0. What appears to the modern reader as the representing function's logical inversion, i.e. the representing function is 0 when the function R is \"true\" or satisfied\", plays a useful role in Kleene's definition of the logical  functions OR, AND, and IMPLY (p.&nbsp;228), the bounded- (p.&nbsp;228) and unbounded- (p.&nbsp;279ff) [[mu operator]]s (Kleene (1952)) and the CASE function (p.&nbsp;229).\n\n==Characteristic function in fuzzy set theory==\nIn classical mathematics, characteristic functions of sets only take values 1 (members) or 0 (non-members). In [[fuzzy set theory]], characteristic functions are generalized to take value in the real unit interval [0,&nbsp;1], or more generally, in some [[universal algebra|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (usually required to be at least a [[partially ordered set|poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Such generalized characteristic functions are more usually called [[membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]s, and the corresponding \"sets\" are called ''fuzzy'' sets. Fuzzy sets model the gradual change in the membership [[degree of truth|degree]] seen in many real-world [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]s like \"tall\", \"warm\", etc.\n\n==Derivatives of the indicator function==\n{{Main|Laplacian of the indicator}}\nA particular indicator function is the [[Heaviside step function]]. The Heaviside step function  ''H''(''x'') is the indicator function of the one-dimensional positive half-line, i.e. the domain [0, \u221e). The [[distributional derivative]] of the Heaviside step function is equal to the [[Dirac delta function]], i.e.\n\n:<math>\n\\delta(x)=\\tfrac{d H(x)}{dx},\n</math>\n\nwith the following property:\n\n:<math>\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\, \\delta(x) dx =  f(0).\n</math>\n\nThe derivative of the Heaviside step function can be seen as the 'inward normal derivative' at the 'boundary' of the domain given by the positive half-line. In higher dimensions, the derivative naturally generalises to the inward normal derivative, while the Heaviside step function naturally generalises to the indicator function of some domain ''D''. The surface of ''D'' will be denoted by ''S''. Proceeding, it can be derived that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] gives rise to a 'surface delta function', which can be indicated by \u03b4<sub>''S''</sub>('''x'''):\n\n:<math>\\delta_S(\\mathbf{x})=-\\mathbf{n}_x\\cdot\\nabla_x\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in D}</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' is the outward [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] of the surface ''S''. This 'surface delta function' has the following property:<ref>{{Citation |last=Lange |first=Rutger-Jan |title=Potential theory, path integrals and the Laplacian of the indicator |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=2012 |issue=11 |pages=29\u201330 |year=2012 |arxiv=1302.0864 |bibcode=2012JHEP...11..032L |doi=10.1007/JHEP11(2012)032}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n-\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n}f(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\mathbf{n}_x\\cdot\\nabla_x\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in D}\\;d^{n}\\mathbf{x}=\\oint_{S}\\,f(\\mathbf{\\beta})\\;d^{n-1}\\mathbf{\\beta}.\n</math>\n\nBy setting the function ''f'' equal to one, it follows that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] integrates to the numerical value of the [[surface area]] ''S''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Dirac measure]]\n* [[Laplacian of the indicator]]\n* [[Dirac delta]]\n* [[Extension (predicate logic)]]\n* [[Free variables and bound variables]]\n* [[Heaviside step function]]\n* [[Iverson bracket]]\n* [[Kronecker delta]], a function that can be viewed as an indicator for the [[Equality (mathematics)|identity relation]]\n* [[Macaulay brackets]]\n* [[Multiset]]\n* [[Membership function (mathematics)|Membership function]]\n* [[Simple function]]\n* [[Dummy variable (statistics)]]\n* [[Statistical classification]]\n* [[Zero-one loss function]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book |last=Folland |first=G.B. |title=Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-31716-6 |edition=Second}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Cormen |first=Thomas H. |title=Introduction to Algorithms |title-link=Introduction to Algorithms |last2=Leiserson |first2=Charles E. |last3=Rivest |first3=Ronald L. |last4=Stein |first4=Clifford |publisher=MIT Press and McGraw-Hill |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-262-03293-3 |edition=Second |pages=94\u201399 |chapter=Section 5.2: Indicator random variables |author-link=Thomas H.

The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

Meanwhile, all the Khalsa bands got together and passed a resolution that Nadir shah had plundered the city of Delhi and now he is taking Indian women as slaves to his country. Sikhs made a plan to free all the slaves. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was 21 years old at that time, he planned raids to free all slaves.

His repeated invasions destroyed the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] administration of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]\nand the rest of [[Northwestern India]].

In 1762, Ahmad Shah Durrani returned and had the Golden Temple blown up with gunpowder. Sikhs returned and celebrated Divali in its premises. In 1764, Baba Jassa Singh Ahluwalia collected donations to rebuild the Golden Temple.\n\n== Early life ==\nJassa Singh Ahluwalia was born at a village called Ahlu in the [[Lahore]] District of [[Punjab]] (modern day Pakistan).<ref name=\"Singhia 2009 page=111\"/><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fa6B20l9AeQC&pg=PA34&dq=kasur+arabic+punjab&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5vXF09nYAhUU8WMKHU-mAcc4ChDoAQg-MAY#v=onepage&q=kasur%20arabic%20punjab&f=false|title=Sikh Studies|last=Singha|first=Dr H.

Meanwhile, all the Khalsa bands got together and passed a resolution that Nadir shah had plundered the city of Delhi and now he is taking Indian women as slaves to his country. Sikhs made a plan to free all the slaves. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was 21 years old at that time, he planned raids to free all slaves. He along with other Sikh bands attacked Nadir shah forces, freed all slaves and send those slaves back to their families safely.<ref name=\"hello\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OVqP54UEe4QC&pg=PA117|title=Revenge and Reconciliation|author=Rajmohan Gandhi|pages=118}}</ref>\n\nAhluwalia participated in many battles as well where he proved himself to be a natural leader. In a 1748 meeting of the [[Sarbat Khalsa]], Nawab Kapur Singh appointed him as his successor.

He established his own dynasty, the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]], which was the name of the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] [[khel (clan)|khel]] to which he belonged to.\n\nStarting from December, 1747 till 1769, Abdali made a total of nine incursions into the northwestern [[India]]. His repeated invasions destroyed the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] administration of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]\nand the rest of [[Northwestern India]]. At the [[Third Battle of Panipat]], he along with [[Nawab of Oudh]] and [[Rohilla]]s, defeated the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], who after treaty signed in 1752 became the protector of the Mughal throne at Delhi and were controlling much of North India, including Punjab and [[Kashmir]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Gordon\n |first = Stewart\n |title = The Marathas 1600\u20131818, Volume 2\n |publisher = Cambridge University Press, 1993\n |isbn = 978-0-521-26883-7}}</ref>\nThus he created a power vacuum in the Punjab, which was filled by the [[Sikhs]].\n\n== The Sixth Abdali Incursion, 1762 ==\nOn 5 February 1762, the Sikhs were especially the target of Ahmad Shah Abdali's sixth invasion into India.

The Maharajas of Patiala and Jind stood before him in all reverence and humility. The Rajas of Nalagarh, Bilaspur, Kangra Hills and Jammu touched his knees. The Nawabs of Malerkotla and Kunjpura paid him homage. And yet he remained a humble and docile disciple of Guru Gobind Singh. In the person of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, the Guru actually made a sparrow kill hawks. Jassa Singh was a great warrior, mighty general and eminent organiser.
