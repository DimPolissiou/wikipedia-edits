Many '''royal heirs''' stayed in the Kuchesar Fort as a means of furthering profits stemming from India, thus increasing the trading depot's popularity. Eventually government officials closed the fort due to a significant number of [[Death|deaths]] and [[Disease|illnesses]]. Many theorized that a heap of overgrowing plants was responsible for the \"unhealthy environment\". Recently, the locals of [[Kuchesar]] took the initiative to clear away the plants that once grew all over the building. It was restored and is now known as \"Mud Hotel\" in the state of '''''[[Uttar Pradesh, India]],''''' and acts as a tourist attraction for the city and to do the supra.\n\n\n==History==\nKuchesar Fort was the seat of the Jat Princely estate at [[Kuchesar]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaJatsMinorKings.htm|title=Kingdoms of South Asia - Minor Indian Kingdoms of the Jats|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> during the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[British Raj]]. The [[Jat people]] competed with the [[Maratha]]s, the [[Rohilla|Rohillas,]] and French colonists and explorers, as well as the [[British East India Company]], after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]]. Kuchesar Fort was also a center for the Rai Brahmins, also called Bhatts \u2013 a branch of [[Kashmiri Brahmins]]. They were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State (Rajkavis are similar to [[Poet laureate|poets laureate]]). Rai Moti Bhatt was the last Rajkavi of the Kuchesar State.\n\nThe rulers of Kuchesar built the fort in 1734 and maintained state population and awareness records. The fort was granted to Ramdhan Singh's family on a perpetual lease by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] in 1790 (this grant was confirmed by the [[British Raj|British]] in 1807).

Many '''royal heirs''' stayed in the Kuchesar Fort as a means of furthering profits stemming from India, thus increasing the trading depot's popularity. Eventually government officials closed the fort due to a significant number of [[Death|deaths]] and [[Disease|illnesses]]. Many theorized that a heap of overgrowing plants was responsible for the \"unhealthy environment\". Recently, the locals of [[Kuchesar]] took the initiative to clear away the plants that once grew all over the building.
