From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party [[Liberal Democrats (Germany)|Liberal Democrats]] (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU/CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a [[bloc party (politics)|bloc party]] on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former bloc party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP centre-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new centre-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.

In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009.

From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.

In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009.

It assists in determining what to change, when to change it, and how to cause the change. The theory was established by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt through his 1984 bestselling novel [[The Goal]]. Since this time, TOC has continued to develop and evolve and is a primary management tool in the engineering industry. When Applying TOC, powerful tools are used to determine the constraint and reduce its effect on the procedure, including:\n\n*The Five Focusing Steps\n*The Thinking Process\n*Throughput Accounting\n\nAlthough still limited by varying factors, time factors and human identification, TOC is the ideal engineering solution to increasing profit and reducing idle time in a production through its elimination of 'the weak link.'\n\n== History ==\n\nTheory of Constraints is a method to determine a procedure in a sequence of procedures which has the greatest negative effect on the production line. The theory was first derived by Dr Eliyahu Goldratt through his 1984 bestselling novel, 'The Goal.' Dr Goldratt was a well-regarded educator in the construction industry, being sought-after by many large companies. In the mid 1990s, Goldratt in 2000, established Goldratt's Marketing Group to further enhance the TOC knowledge to those interested. Goldratt's Marketing Group was established to further enhance the knowledge of businesses in product production, suppliers and distributors, project managers and retail workers, further develop the quality of decision-making, improving communication and stimulating new solutions.<ref>[https://www.toc-goldratt.com/tocweekly/biography-of-dr-eliyahu-m-goldratt/ Goldratt's Marketing Group],</ref>\n\nThe theory operates with the assumption that every process has at least one influencing constraint, of which must be improved for the process to become more economic. Time spent trying to maximise processes which are not considered the bottleneck will not provide any benefits to the system. Attempting to reduce the influencing factor the bottleneck has on the entire system, will further the 'goal.' The procedure of reducing the influencing factor the bottleneck has on the system, continues as one bottleneck is minimised the attention turns to the new largest hindering procedure. \n\n==Bottleneck==\nIn streamline manufacturing, the bottleneck is the station of a production line where greatest limiting factor lies. It is generally the station with the greatest amount of [[work in process]] at the work station. Bottlenecks often results in slow production times, surplus of [[raw material]] and low employee morale. \n\nNearly every manufacturing system initially has a bottleneck. It is critical to be able to determine the procedure in the production line which is the limiting factor. Generally the  station which has accumulated the largest amount of WIP can be considered the Bottleneck, however other engineering management techniques can be applied to determine the bottle neck.\n\n== Application ==\nThere are several practiced techniques applied to streamline manufacturing to reduce and or eliminate the constraining factor in the system. The methods applied to the systems all are designed to isolate the constraint, break it down into its components and find a suitable solution to reducing the negative impact the station has on the entire system. The thinking processes as well as the identification of the bottleneck is conducted in different manners. The four most common practiced techniques include; Five Focusing Steps, Thinking Process, Throughput Accounting and the Drum-Buffer-Effect. \n=== Five Focusing Steps ===\nThe five focusing steps of TOC is an ideal approach to identifying the bottleneck and the correct procedure to reduce the impact keeping in mind the 'goal.' The five focusing steps are:\n#Identify the Constraint\n#Exploit the Constraint\n#Subordinate the Constraint\n#Elevate the Constraint\n#Repeat the Process\n\n====Identify the Constraint ====\nThe first step is to determine which process in the system is increasing the procedures overall [[throughput]]. Indicators of the bottleneck in the system will have accumulated a large amount of [[work in progress]] (WIP) and will have a higher average cycle time. \n\n==== Exploit the Constraint ====\nExploiting the constraint is the procedure of quickly improving the current bottleneck with minimal disruption to the production line. Common rapid relief techniques include:\n*Inventory buffers\n*Quality check\n*Continuous operation\n*Schedule around bottleneck\n*Offload constraint work\nImprovements in these fields will have a quick solution to improvement of the constraint which will result in improved throughput\n\n==== Subordinate to the Constraint ====\nThis step focuses on techniques to mitigate impact from upstream or downstream processes which may further delay the operations of the bottleneck. Techniques include:\n*Drum-Buffer-Rope\n*Subordinate maintenance\n*Added sprint capacity\n*Operations pace\n\n==== Elevate the Constraint ====\nIn this step, actions are taken to break the constraints by the implementation of larger changes to improve the bottleneck. These changes usually include a large investment of time and or money. Techniques used include:\n*Use of performance data\n*[[Single-Minute Exchange of Die]] (SMED) program\n*Design improvements\n*Purchase additional equipment/staff\n\n==== Repeat the Process ====\nOnce the initial steps of the Five Focusing Steps have been executed, the bottleneck of focus should no longer be the hindering process of the system. The implementation of the Five Focusing Steps is not used for one off improvement but for continuous improvements to the process. If the bottleneck has been broken, the next step is to repeat the focusing steps for the new bottleneck. If the bottleneck has not been broken, a new approach needs to be taken, including verifying that the investigated constraint has correctly been identified as the bottleneck. \n\n\n=== Thinking Process ===\nThe [[thinking process]] in TOC, are tools used to determine, and fixing a problem in a system. In streamline processing it is a fundamental approach to always be striving to improve processes, eliminate bottlenecks and reduce manufacturing time.  A common approach is to answer the following questions:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/Thinking%20Process.htm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911080409/http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/Thinking%20Process.htm |archivedate=2017-09-11 }} A Guide to Implementing the Theory of Constraints],</ref>\n*What should I change?\n*What should It change to?\n*How to cause the change?\n\nAsking these questions when faced with a problem in a production line, will offer a range of solutions simultaneously to improve the current situation. The thinking process allows a smooth transition through the layers of the process to be able to adapt a more suitable method to improve the manufacturing system.\n\n=== Throughput Accounting ===\n[[Throughput accounting]] (TA) is a simple management accounting technique providing managers with information support to make profitable decisions for their system. It is an alternative method to traditional cost accounting, in which limiting factors in a system are identified and simple solutions are adapted to move towards reaching the businesses goal. The actions of throughput accounting maximize the net profit from a system in the shortest amount of time, with limited resources and limited expenditures. \n\nThroughput accounting uses through methods in dealing with income and expenses in a system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldratt.co.uk/articles/newsletter/back_to_basics_1.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012094105/http://www.goldratt.co.uk/articles/newsletter/back_to_basics_1.html |archivedate=2017-10-12 }} Goldratt, Knowledge that Delivers],</ref>\n\n[[Throughput]] (T) is the rate at which a system can produce a unit. For profit orientated systems, throughput is considered [[net sales]] (S) minus [[totally variable cost]] (TVC). \n\n[[Investment]] (I) is the monetary value of the system. The value of inventory, buildings, machines and other assets are considered investments. \n\n[[Operating expenses]] (OE) is the cost of the supply chain operating to produce the unit. For a system manufacturing a physical item, the operating expense is the investment cost minus the cost of raw materials but including the cost of maintenance, rent and taxes. \n\n===Drum-Buffer-Rope ===\n\n== Constraints and Limitations ==\nA key process in TOC is the identification of the limiting factor in a production system to ultimately improve the production of units. A major limitation in the theory is that of identifying the station which is in fact the limiting procedure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/limitations-theory-constraints-16352.html/  |accessdate=2017-09-21 |df= }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Limitations of the Theory of Constrains],</ref>. \n\n=== Identification ===\nIt is not uncommon that when applying TOC the wrong work station is being examined as the limiting station when, however this station may only be the bottleneck due to another constraining factor not being focused on. This limitation theory, may encourage the waste of resources and times on a station which may in fact not require optimizing. \n\n=== Variation ===\nAnother limitation of the theory is the lack of consideration towards varying factors. Factors such as demand for a product are not directly examined when TOC is applied. If the market demand for a product is varying, the use of resources  to improve the situation may be better used expanding production capacity. \n\n=== Time === \nTime is an influential constraint when applying TOC. The theory does not consider the current time frame for the production system and the duration of the demand for the product. The theory limits itself to short-term effects on the system rather than forecasting for the future. Overcoming this constraint means examining the long-term effects of work done to improve the constraint. If findings in a short-term analysis seem to repeat they can be considered as long-term effects, therefore implementing changes may be appropriate. \n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Production economics]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=October 2017}}\n{{original research|date=October 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2017}}\n[[Theory of constraints]] (TOC) is an engineering management technique used to evaluate a manageable procedure, identifying the largest constraint (bottleneck) and strategizing to reduce task time and maximise profit.

The procedure of reducing the influencing factor the bottleneck has on the system, continues as one bottleneck is minimised the attention turns to the new largest hindering procedure. \n\n==Bottleneck==\nIn streamline manufacturing, the bottleneck is the station of a production line where greatest limiting factor lies. It is generally the station with the greatest amount of [[work in process]] at the work station. Bottlenecks often results in slow production times, surplus of [[raw material]] and low employee morale. \n\nNearly every manufacturing system initially has a bottleneck. It is critical to be able to determine the procedure in the production line which is the limiting factor. Generally the  station which has accumulated the largest amount of WIP can be considered the Bottleneck, however other engineering management techniques can be applied to determine the bottle neck.\n\n== Application ==\nThere are several practiced techniques applied to streamline manufacturing to reduce and or eliminate the constraining factor in the system. The methods applied to the systems all are designed to isolate the constraint, break it down into its components and find a suitable solution to reducing the negative impact the station has on the entire system. The thinking processes as well as the identification of the bottleneck is conducted in different manners. The four most common practiced techniques include; Five Focusing Steps, Thinking Process, Throughput Accounting and the Drum-Buffer-Effect. \n=== Five Focusing Steps ===\nThe five focusing steps of TOC is an ideal approach to identifying the bottleneck and the correct procedure to reduce the impact keeping in mind the 'goal.' The five focusing steps are:\n#Identify the Constraint\n#Exploit the Constraint\n#Subordinate the Constraint\n#Elevate the Constraint\n#Repeat the Process\n\n====Identify the Constraint ====\nThe first step is to determine which process in the system is increasing the procedures overall [[throughput]]. Indicators of the bottleneck in the system will have accumulated a large amount of [[work in progress]] (WIP) and will have a higher average cycle time. \n\n==== Exploit the Constraint ====\nExploiting the constraint is the procedure of quickly improving the current bottleneck with minimal disruption to the production line. Common rapid relief techniques include:\n*Inventory buffers\n*Quality check\n*Continuous operation\n*Schedule around bottleneck\n*Offload constraint work\nImprovements in these fields will have a quick solution to improvement of the constraint which will result in improved throughput\n\n==== Subordinate to the Constraint ====\nThis step focuses on techniques to mitigate impact from upstream or downstream processes which may further delay the operations of the bottleneck. Techniques include:\n*Drum-Buffer-Rope\n*Subordinate maintenance\n*Added sprint capacity\n*Operations pace\n\n==== Elevate the Constraint ====\nIn this step, actions are taken to break the constraints by the implementation of larger changes to improve the bottleneck. These changes usually include a large investment of time and or money. Techniques used include:\n*Use of performance data\n*[[Single-Minute Exchange of Die]] (SMED) program\n*Design improvements\n*Purchase additional equipment/staff\n\n==== Repeat the Process ====\nOnce the initial steps of the Five Focusing Steps have been executed, the bottleneck of focus should no longer be the hindering process of the system. The implementation of the Five Focusing Steps is not used for one off improvement but for continuous improvements to the process. If the bottleneck has been broken, the next step is to repeat the focusing steps for the new bottleneck. If the bottleneck has not been broken, a new approach needs to be taken, including verifying that the investigated constraint has correctly been identified as the bottleneck. \n\n\n=== Thinking Process ===\nThe [[thinking process]] in TOC, are tools used to determine, and fixing a problem in a system. In streamline processing it is a fundamental approach to always be striving to improve processes, eliminate bottlenecks and reduce manufacturing time.  A common approach is to answer the following questions:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/Thinking%20Process.htm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911080409/http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/Thinking%20Process.htm |archivedate=2017-09-11 }} A Guide to Implementing the Theory of Constraints],</ref>\n*What should I change?\n*What should It change to?\n*How to cause the change?\n\nAsking these questions when faced with a problem in a production line, will offer a range of solutions simultaneously to improve the current situation. The thinking process allows a smooth transition through the layers of the process to be able to adapt a more suitable method to improve the manufacturing system.\n\n=== Throughput Accounting ===\n[[Throughput accounting]] (TA) is a simple management accounting technique providing managers with information support to make profitable decisions for their system. It is an alternative method to traditional cost accounting, in which limiting factors in a system are identified and simple solutions are adapted to move towards reaching the businesses goal. The actions of throughput accounting maximize the net profit from a system in the shortest amount of time, with limited resources and limited expenditures. \n\nThroughput accounting uses through methods in dealing with income and expenses in a system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldratt.co.uk/articles/newsletter/back_to_basics_1.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012094105/http://www.goldratt.co.uk/articles/newsletter/back_to_basics_1.html |archivedate=2017-10-12 }} Goldratt, Knowledge that Delivers],</ref>\n\n[[Throughput]] (T) is the rate at which a system can produce a unit. For profit orientated systems, throughput is considered [[net sales]] (S) minus [[totally variable cost]] (TVC). \n\n[[Investment]] (I) is the monetary value of the system. The value of inventory, buildings, machines and other assets are considered investments. \n\n[[Operating expenses]] (OE) is the cost of the supply chain operating to produce the unit. For a system manufacturing a physical item, the operating expense is the investment cost minus the cost of raw materials but including the cost of maintenance, rent and taxes. \n\n===Drum-Buffer-Rope ===\n\n== Constraints and Limitations ==\nA key process in TOC is the identification of the limiting factor in a production system to ultimately improve the production of units. A major limitation in the theory is that of identifying the station which is in fact the limiting procedure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/limitations-theory-constraints-16352.html/  |accessdate=2017-09-21 |df= }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Limitations of the Theory of Constrains],</ref>. \n\n=== Identification ===\nIt is not uncommon that when applying TOC the wrong work station is being examined as the limiting station when, however this station may only be the bottleneck due to another constraining factor not being focused on. This limitation theory, may encourage the waste of resources and times on a station which may in fact not require optimizing. \n\n=== Variation ===\nAnother limitation of the theory is the lack of consideration towards varying factors. Factors such as demand for a product are not directly examined when TOC is applied. If the market demand for a product is varying, the use of resources  to improve the situation may be better used expanding production capacity. \n\n=== Time === \nTime is an influential constraint when applying TOC. The theory does not consider the current time frame for the production system and the duration of the demand for the product. The theory limits itself to short-term effects on the system rather than forecasting for the future. Overcoming this constraint means examining the long-term effects of work done to improve the constraint. If findings in a short-term analysis seem to repeat they can be considered as long-term effects, therefore implementing changes may be appropriate. \n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Production economics]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints_in_streamline_manufacturing"}

B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]]]]\nRSS was founded in 1925 by [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M.

He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other Universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it....

A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident.

Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

Even an unorthodox Hindu feels himself bound at least in some matters by the rules contained in the ''Smrithis'' and he feels powerless to give up altogether his adherence to them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Undoing India the RSS Way|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ5pO46SPk0C&pg=PA81|year=2002|publisher=Media House|isbn=978-81-7495-142-7|pages=81\u2013}}</ref>}} The RSS' opposition to, and vitriolic attacks against, the Constitution of India continued post-independence. In 1966 Golwalkar, in his book titled ''[[Bunch of Thoughts]]'' asserted:{{Quote|Our Constitution too is just a cumbersome and heterogeneous piecing together of various articles from various Constitutions of Western countries.

A Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to the murder of Gandhi was set, and its report was published by India's Ministry of Home Affairs in the year 1970. Accordingly, the [[Kapur Commission|Justice Kapur Commission]]<ref name=\"kapoor\">{{cite book|title=Report of Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi, By India (Republic).

Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same. Patel then demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution<ref name=\"PLJ100\">{{cite book |last1=Panicker |first1=P L John |title=Gandhian approach to communalism in contemporary India |page=100 |url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/7178/9/09_chapter%202.pdf#page=79 |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> and make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the [[Constitution of India]], accept the Tricolor as the [[National Flag]] of India, define the power of the head of the organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce violence and secrecy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=88, 89}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=14}}<ref name=\"Noorani2000\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PnBFW7cdtsC&pg=PT42|title=The RSS and the BJP: A Division of Labour|author=Abdul Gafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani|publisher=LeftWord Books|year=2000|isbn=978-81-87496-13-7}}</ref>{{rp|42\u2013}} Golwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=89}}\n\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.<ref name=\"Curran1950\"/><ref name=\"Noorani2000\" />\n\n===Decolonisation of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa===\n\nAfter India had achieved independence, the RSS was one of the socio-political organisations that supported and participated in movements to decolonise [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which at that time was ruled by Portugal. In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref> On the night of 21 July, United Front of Goans, a group working independently of the coalition, captured the Portuguese police station at Dadra and declared Dadra independent. Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954. A native administration was set up with Appasaheb Karmalkar of the NMLO as the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 11 August 1954.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\" />\n\nThe capture of Dadra and Nagar Haveli gave a boost to the movement against Portuguese colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\"/> In 1955 RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression. On 15 August 1955, the Portuguese police opened fire on the ''satyagrahis'', killing thirty or so civilians.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=130}}\n\nGoa was later [[Annexation of Goa|annexed into the Indian union]] in 1961 through an army operation, codenamed '[[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]', that was carried out by the Nehru government.\n\n===War-time activities===\nAfter the declaration of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Bangladesh War of Independence]] by [[Indira Gandhi]], RSS provided support to the government, by offering its services to maintain law and order in Delhi and its volunteers were apparently the first to donate blood.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=243}}\n\n===Movement against the Emergency===\nIn 1975 the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule in India]], thereby suspending [[fundamental rights (India)|fundamental rights]] and curtailing the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=emma>Emma Tarlo, ''Unsettling Memories: Narratives of India's \"emergency\"'', Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7824-066-1}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-066-4}}</ref> This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of [[malpractice]]s in the election.<ref name=emma/> Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders, including Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008}} RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=297}}\n\nDeoras, the then chief of RSS, wrote letters to Indira Gandhi, promising her to extend the organisation's co-operation in return for the lifting of the ban, asserting that RSS had no connection with the [[Bihar Movement|movement in Bihar]] and [[Navnirman Andolan|that in Gujarat]]. He tried to persuade Vinoba Bhave to mediate between the RSS and the government and also sought the offices of [[Sanjay Gandhi]], Indira Gandhi's son.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}{{sfn|Noorani, RSS and the BJP|2000|p=31}} Later, when there was no response, volunteers of the RSS formed underground movements against the Emergency.<ref name=\":0\" /> Literature that was censored in the media was clandestinely published and distributed on a large scale, and funds were collected for the movement.

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

G.|year=2000|isbn=9788187496137|location=New Delhi|pages=99}}</ref>\n\n=== Involvement in politics ===\nSeveral Sangh Parivar politicians such as [[Balraj Madhok]] in the 1960s and 1970s to the [[BJP]] leaders like [[L. K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]]]]\nRSS was founded in 1925 by [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M. L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol{{nbsp}}3) p.{{nbsp}}854 (Dr.{{nbsp}}Hedgewar with five other ''swayamsevaks'' who established RSS in 1925)</ref>]]\nHedgewar believed that a handful of British were able to rule over the vast country of India because Hindus were disunited, lacked valour (''pararkram'') and lacked a civic character.  He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other Universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it.... All defined a Hindu no less than a British \"other\".'</ref> When Gandhi called off the Non-co-operation movement due to outbreaks of violence, Muslims disagreed with his strategy. Once the movements failed, the mobilised Muslims turned their anger towards Hindus.<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001}}; {{harvp|Misra, Identity and Religion: Foundations of Anti-Islamism in India|2004}}</ref> The first major incident of religious violence was reportedly the [[Moplah rebellion]] in August 1921, it was widely narrated that the rebellion ended in large-scale violence against Hindu in [[Malabar region|Malabar]].  A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident. The above incident vastly enhanced the prestige of the RSS and enabled its subsequent expansion.{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Stigmatisation and emulation ===\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] points out the theme of \"stigmatisation and emulation\" in the ideology of the RSS along with other Hindu nationalist movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] and the Hindu Mahasabha.  Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

It stated:{{Quote|Even though Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have recently stated in [[Bombay]] that the days of Manu have ended it is nevertheless a fact that the daily lives of Hindus are even at present-day affected by the principles and injunctions contained in the ''Manusmrithi'' and other ''[[Smriti]]s''.

In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P.

Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954.

When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa.

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

He pledged the support of the RSS for this movement.<ref>Suresh Ramabhai, ''Vinoba and his mission'', published by Akhil Bharat Sarv Seva Sangh, 1954</ref> Consequently, many RSS volunteers, led by [[Nanaji Deshmukh]], participated in the movement.{{sfn|Andersen|Damle|1987|p=111}} But Golwalkar was also critical of the Bhoodan movement on other occasions for being reactionary and for working \"merely with a view to counteracting Communism\". He believed that the movement should inculcate a faith in the masses that would make them rise above the base appeal of Communism.<ref name=bunch/>\n\n=== Reform in 'caste' ===\nThe RSS has advocated the training of Dalits and other backward classes as temple high priests (a position traditionally reserved for [[Caste]] [[Brahmins]] and denied to lower castes).

G.|year=2000|isbn=9788187496137|location=New Delhi|pages=99}}</ref>\n\n=== Involvement in politics ===\nSeveral Sangh Parivar politicians such as [[Balraj Madhok]] in the 1960s and 1970s to the [[BJP]] leaders like [[L. K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

He toured with [[Jennifer Holliday]] in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/>\n\nHis disdain for Columbia's A&R executives or \"blaxperts\", as he termed them, trying to exert control over how he should sound if he wanted to sell more albums, played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign to a record label after 1985, effectively ending his performing career, even though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his 'retirement'.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bill-withers-the-soul-man-who-walked-away-20150414 |title=Bill Withers: The Soul Man Who Walked Away |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7928784/Bill-Withers-interview.html |title=Bill Withers interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/still_bill_the_story_of_bill_withers/ |title=Still Bill: The Story of Bill Withers |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7236327 |title=Songwriter Bill Withers And A Career Cut Short |publisher=NPR |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/08/as-is-2 |title=As Is |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he has said he was socialized as a 'regular guy' who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> After he left the music industry he said that he did not miss touring and performing live and did not regret leaving music behind.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph1\"/>\n\n===Post-Columbia career===\nIn 1988, a new version of \"Lovely Day\" from the 1977 ''Menagerie'' album, entitled \"Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)\" and remixed by [[Ben Liebrand]] was released.
