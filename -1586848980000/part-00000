The [[county town]] is the city of [[Winchester]]. Its two largest cities, [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]], are administered separately as [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]; the rest of the county is governed by [[Hampshire County Council]].\n\nFirst settled about 14,000 years ago, Hampshire's history dates to [[Roman Britain]], when its chief town was Winchester. When the Romans left Britain, the area was infiltrated by tribes from [[Scandinavia]] and [[mainland Europe]], principally in the river valleys. The county was recorded in the 11th century [[Domesday Book]], divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century, the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. By the 16th century, the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester. By the mid-19th century, with the county's population at 219,210 (double that at the beginning of the century) in more than 86,000 dwellings, agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest. Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars. The [[Isle of Wight]], [[Historic counties of England|historically part]] of Hampshire, became a separate [[ceremonial county]] in 1974.\n\nThe county's geography is varied, with upland to {{convert|286|m}} and mostly south-flowing rivers. There are areas of downland and marsh, and two national parks: the [[New Forest National Park|New Forest]], and part of the [[South Downs National Park|South Downs]], which together cover 45 per cent of Hampshire.\n\nHampshire is one of the most affluent counties in the country, with an unemployment rate lower than the national average, and its economy derived from major companies, maritime, agriculture and tourism.  Tourist attractions include many seaside resorts, the national parks and the [[Southampton Boat Show]]. The county is known as the home of writers [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]], the childhood home of [[Florence Nightingale]] and the birthplace of engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].\n\n==Name==\nHampshire takes its name from the settlement that is now the city of Southampton. Southampton was known in Old English as ''Hamtun'', roughly meaning \"village-town\", so its surrounding area or ''sc\u012br'' became known as ''Hamtunsc\u012br''. The old name was recorded in the [[Domesday book]] as ''Hantescire'', and from this spelling, the modern abbreviation \"Hants\" derives.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Hampshire|url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/abouthnt|publisher=Hampshire County Council|accessdate=3 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224622/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/abouthnt|archive-date=4 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  From 1889 until 1959, the [[administrative county]] was named the '''County of Southampton'''<ref>{{cite web|title=County of Hants (Southampton)|url=http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20%28by%20geography%29/England/1891&active=yes&mno=64&tocstate=expandnew&tocseq=2600&display=sections&display=tables&display=pagetitles&pageseq=first-nonblank|work=Census of England and Wales: 1891: Area, Houses and Population: Volume 1|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=27 August 2012|page=121|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515230422/http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse%2FCensus%20%28by%20geography%29%2FEngland%2F1891&active=yes&mno=64&tocstate=expandnew&tocseq=2600&display=sections&display=tables&display=pagetitles&pageseq=first-nonblank|archive-date=15 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Local Government Act 1959: Section 59: Change of Name of County|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/41639/pages/1241|work=The London Gazette|accessdate=27 August 2012|page=1241|date=20 February 1959|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507071652/http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/41639/pages/1241|archive-date=7 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and has also been known as '''Southamptonshire'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vision of Britain|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=831E0EE166940B068F901D2E5F5D2B33?text_id=929180&word=NULL|accessdate=13 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224152528/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=831E0EE166940B068F901D2E5F5D2B33?text_id=929180&word=NULL|archive-date=24 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Gaz1868>{{cite web|title=National Gazetteer|date=1868|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/HAM/Gaz1868.shtml|accessdate=13 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018015223/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/HAM/Gaz1868.shtml|archive-date=18 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHampshire was the departure point of some of those who left England to settle on the east coast of North America during the 17th century, giving its name in particular to the state of [[New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Origin of 'New Hampshire'| url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/new-hampshire/state-name-origin/origin-new-hampshire| publisher=State Symbols USA| accessdate=30 August 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904004447/http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/new-hampshire/state-name-origin/origin-new-hampshire| archive-date=4 September 2015| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The towns of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] and [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] take their names from Portsmouth in Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Portsmouth-New-Hampshire|accessdate=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008175605/https://www.britannica.com/place/Portsmouth-New-Hampshire|archive-date=8 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The City of Portsmouth, Virginia: History|url=http://www.portsmouthva.gov/474/History|accessdate=7 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053238/http://www.portsmouthva.gov/474/History|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory until the Norman Conquest===\n{{Main|History of Hampshire}}\nThe region is believed to have been continuously occupied since the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last Ice Age]] about 12,000 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last = Oppenheimer|first = Stephen|date = 2006|title = The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story|publisher = Carroll & Graf|isbn = 9780786718900|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786718900}}</ref> At this time, Britain was still attached to the European continent and was predominantly covered with deciduous woodland.

In the very late Bronze Age, fortified hilltop settlements known as [[hillforts]] began to appear in large numbers in many parts of Britain including Hampshire, and these became more and more important in the early and middle [[Iron Age]];<ref name= \"CunliffeIronAge\">Cunliffe, B, 2008, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'', fourth edition</ref> many of these are still visible in the landscape today and can be visited, notably [[Danebury|Danebury Rings]], the subject of a major study by archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]].

Probably around this period, the first recorded invasion of Britain took place, as southern Britain was largely conquered by warrior-elites from [[Belgae|Belgic tribes]] of northeastern Gaul - whether these two events are linked to the decline of hillforts is unknown. By the Roman conquest, the ''[[oppidum]]'' at [[Venta Belgarum]], modern-day Winchester, was the ''de facto'' regional administrative centre; Winchester was, however, of secondary importance to the Roman-style town of [[Calleva Atrebatum]], modern [[Silchester]], built further north by a dominant Belgic polity known as the [[Atrebates]] in the 50s BCE. Julius Caesar invaded southeastern England briefly in 55 and again in 54 BCE, but he never reached Hampshire. Notable sites from this period include [[Hengistbury Head]] (now in Dorset), which was a major port.<ref name=\"CunliffeIronAge\" /><ref>Pryor, F, 2004, ''Britain BC''{{full citation needed|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans invaded Britain again in 43 CE, and Hampshire was incorporated into the Roman province of Britannia very quickly. It is generally believed their political leaders allowed themselves to be incorporated peacefully. Venta became the capital of the administrative polity of the Belgae, which included most of Hampshire and Wiltshire and reached as far as Bath. Whether the people of Hampshire played any role in Boudicca's rebellion of 60-61 is not recorded, but evidence of burning is seen in Winchester dated to around this period.<ref>Cunliffe, B, 1991, ''Wessex to AD 1000'', p.218</ref> For most of the next three centuries, southern Britain enjoyed relative peace. The later part of the Roman period had most towns build defensive walls; a pottery industry based in the New Forest exported items widely across southern Britain. A fortification near Southampton was called [[Clausentum]], part of the [[Saxon Shore]] forts, traditionally seen as defences against maritime raids by Germanic tribes. The Romans withdrew from Britain in 410.<ref name=\"CunliffeWessex\">Cunliffe, B, 1991, ''Wessex to AD 1000''</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re|first = Guy|date= 2006|title = Roman Britain: A New History|publisher = Thames & Hudson |isbn = 9780500051405}}</ref><ref name=\"Pryor\">Pryor, F, 2004, ''Britain AD''{{full citation needed|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman Road plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque on Freemantle Common marking the route of the Roman Road from Chichester to Bitterne]]\nTwo major Roman roads, [[Ermin Way]] and [[Port Way]] cross the north of the country connecting Calleva Atrebatum  with [[Corinium Dobunnorum]], modern [[Cirencester]], and [[Old Sarum]] respectively.

}}\n''For the complete list of settlements see [[List of places in Hampshire]] and [[List of settlements in Hampshire by population]].''\n\nHampshire's [[county town]] is Winchester, a historic city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Wessex]] and of England until the [[Norman conquest of England]]. The port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth were split off as independent unitary authorities in 1997, although they are still included in Hampshire for ceremonial purposes. [[Fareham]], [[Gosport]] and [[Havant]] have grown into a [[conurbation]] that stretches along the coast between the two main cities. The three cities are all university cities, Southampton being home to the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Southampton Solent University]] (formerly Southampton Institute), Portsmouth to the [[University of Portsmouth]], and Winchester to the [[University of Winchester]] (formerly known as University College Winchester; King Alfred's College). The northeast of the county houses the [[Aldershot Urban Area|Blackwater Valley]] conurbation, which includes the towns of [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Aldershot]], [[Blackwater, Hampshire|Blackwater]] and [[Yateley]] and borders both [[Berkshire]] and Surrey.\n\nHampshire lies outside the [[green belt]] area of restricted development around London, but has good railway and motorway links to the capital, and in common with the rest of the south-east has seen the growth of [[dormitory town]]s since the 1960s. [[Basingstoke]], in the northern part of the county, has grown from a country town into a business and financial centre. Aldershot, Portsmouth, and Farnborough have strong military associations with the [[British Army|Army]], Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force respectively.

The [[county town]] is the city of [[Winchester]]. Its two largest cities, [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]], are administered separately as [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]; the rest of the county is governed by [[Hampshire County Council]].\n\nFirst settled about 14,000 years ago, Hampshire's history dates to [[Roman Britain]], when its chief town was Winchester. When the Romans left Britain, the area was infiltrated by tribes from [[Scandinavia]] and [[mainland Europe]], principally in the river valleys. The county was recorded in the 11th century [[Domesday Book]], divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century, the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. By the 16th century, the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester. By the mid-19th century, with the county's population at 219,210 (double that at the beginning of the century) in more than 86,000 dwellings, agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest. Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars. The [[Isle of Wight]], [[Historic counties of England|historically part]] of Hampshire, became a separate [[ceremonial county]] in 1974.\n\nThe county's geography is varied, with upland to {{convert|286|m}} and mostly south-flowing rivers. There are areas of downland and marsh, and two national parks: the [[New Forest National Park|New Forest]], and part of the [[South Downs National Park|South Downs]], which together cover 45 per cent of Hampshire.\n\nHampshire is one of the most affluent counties in the country, with an unemployment rate lower than the national average, and its economy derived from major companies, maritime, agriculture and tourism.  Tourist attractions include many seaside resorts, the national parks and the [[Southampton Boat Show]].

By the Roman conquest, the ''[[oppidum]]'' at [[Venta Belgarum]], modern-day Winchester, was the ''de facto'' regional administrative centre; Winchester was, however, of secondary importance to the Roman-style town of [[Calleva Atrebatum]], modern [[Silchester]], built further north by a dominant Belgic polity known as the [[Atrebates]] in the 50s BCE.

that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Wessex]] and of England until the [[Norman conquest of England]]. The port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth were split off as independent unitary authorities in 1997, although they are still included in Hampshire for ceremonial purposes. [[Fareham]], [[Gosport]] and [[Havant]] have grown into a [[conurbation]] that stretches along the coast between the two main cities. The three cities are all university cities, Southampton being home to the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Southampton Solent University]] (formerly Southampton Institute), Portsmouth to the [[University of Portsmouth]], and Winchester to the [[University of Winchester]] (formerly known as University College Winchester; King Alfred's College). The northeast of the county houses the [[Aldershot Urban Area|Blackwater Valley]] conurbation, which includes the towns of [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Aldershot]], [[Blackwater, Hampshire|Blackwater]] and [[Yateley]] and borders both [[Berkshire]] and Surrey.\n\nHampshire lies outside the [[green belt]] area of restricted development around London, but has good railway and motorway links to the capital, and in common with the rest of the south-east has seen the growth of [[dormitory town]]s since the 1960s. [[Basingstoke]], in the northern part of the county, has grown from a country town into a business and financial centre. Aldershot, Portsmouth, and Farnborough have strong military associations with the [[British Army|Army]], Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force respectively. The county also includes several [[market town]]s:Alresford  [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]], [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Bishop's Waltham]], [[Lymington]], [[New Milton]], [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], [[Ringwood]], [[Romsey]] and [[Whitchurch, Hampshire|Whitchurch]].\n\n==Demographics==\n===Population===\nAt the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]]<ref>[[Office for National Statistics]] & Hampshire County Council, 2003, [http://www.hants.gov.uk/census/ Census 2001 data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402212034/http://www.hants.gov.uk/census/ |date=2 April 2003 }}</ref> the ceremonial county recorded a population of 1,644,249, of which 1,240,103 were in the administrative county, 217,445 were in the unitary authority of Southampton, and 186,701 were in Portsmouth.

Tourism accounts for some 60,000 jobs in the county, around 9 per cent of the total.<ref name=Hants2018 />\n\nOne of the principal companies in the high tech sector is [[IBM]] which has its research and development laboratories at [[IBM Hursley|Hursley]] and its UK headquarters at [[Cosham]].\n\nMany rural areas of Hampshire have traditionally been reliant on agriculture, particularly [[dairy farming]], although the significance of agriculture as a rural employer and rural wealth creator has declined since the first half of the 20th century and agriculture currently employs 1.32 per cent of the rural population.\n\nThe extractive industries deal principally with sand, gravel, clay and hydrocarbons.  There are three active oilfields in Hampshire with one being also used as a natural gas store.  These are in the west of the county in the ''Wessex Basin''.  The ''Weald Basin'' to the east has potential as a source of shale oil but is not currently exploited.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hampshire Minerals & Waste Plan|url=http://documents.hants.gov.uk/mineralsandwaste/consultation-2015/OilandGasDevelopmentinHampshireBackgroundStudyv1June2015.pdf|website=hants.gov.uk|accessdate=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005202837/http://documents.hants.gov.uk/mineralsandwaste/consultation-2015/OilandGasDevelopmentinHampshireBackgroundStudyv1June2015.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe New Forest area is a national park, and tourism is a significant economic segment in this area, with 7.5&nbsp;million visitors in 1992.<ref>New Forest District Council, n.d. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050527172449/http://www.thenewforest.co.uk/moreinfo/students/students_.htm Tourism questions and answers].\"</ref> The South Downs and the cities of Portsmouth, Southampton, and Winchester also attract tourists to the county.

The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

In millions of years, [[slab pull]], [[ridge-push]], and other forces of [[tectonophysics]] will further separate and rotate those two continents. It was that temporary feature that inspired Wegener to study what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his hypothesis generally accepted.\n\nThe widespread distribution of [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

Often the gun suffered from a malfunction known as \"failure to extract\", which meant that the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a round was fired. According to a congressional report, the malfunction was caused by a change of gunpowder in the ammunition, which was done without adequate testing and by a money saving policy, headed by Robert S. McNamara, to not issue adequate cleaning kits to soldiers. This led to a myth of a self-cleaning gun. These decisions were made without regard to the safety of soldiers and resulted in many deaths.\n\nThe heavily armored, 90&nbsp;mm gun [[M48 Patton|M48A3 'Patton' tank]] saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with U.S. forces. They played an important role in infantry support though there were a  few tank versus tank battles. The [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank|M67A1 flamethrower tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam. Artillery was used extensively by both sides but the Americans were able to ferry the lightweight 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer]] by helicopter to remote locations on quick notice.<ref>Bart Hagerman, USA Airborne: 50th Anniversary, Turner Publishing Company, p.237</ref><ref name=\"Tolsonarmy\">{{cite book |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/vietnam/airmobility/airmobility-fm.html |title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961\u201371 |work = Department of the Army |author = Lieutenant General John J.

War]]''', which involved the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) or North Vietnamese Army (NVA), National Liberation Front for South Vietnam (NLF) or [[Viet Cong]] (VC), and the armed forces of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), [[United States Armed Forces|United States]], [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|Republic of Korea]], [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Thailand]], and the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian]], [[New Zealand Defence Force|New Zealand]] defence forces, and a variety of irregular troops.\n\nNearly all United States-allied forces were armed with U.S. weapons including the [[M1 Garand]], [[M1 carbine]], [[M14 rifle|M-14]] and [[M16 rifle|M-16]].  The Australian and New Zealand forces employed the 7.62&nbsp;mm [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] as their service rifle, with the occasional US M16.\n\nThe PAVN, although having inherited a variety of American, French, and Japanese weapons from [[World War II]] and the [[First Indochina War]] (aka French Indochina War), were largely armed and supplied by the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Soviet Union]], and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies. In addition, some weapons\u2014notably anti-personnel explosives, the [[K-50M]] (a [[PPSh-41]] copy), and \"home-made\" versions of the [[RPG-2]]\u2014were manufactured in North Vietnam. By 1969 the US Army had identified 40 rifle/carbine types, 22 machine gun types, 17 types of mortar, 20 recoilless rifle or rocket launcher types, nine types of antitank weapons, and 14 anti-aircraft artillery weapons used by ground troops on all sides. Also in use, primarily by anti-communist forces, were the 24 types of armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery, and 26 types of field artillery and rocket launchers.\n\n==Communist forces and weapons==\n[[File:Captured NVA Weapons.jpg|thumb|Captured PAVN weapons]]\nDuring the early stages of their insurgency, the Viet Cong mainly sustained itself with captured arms (often of American manufacture){{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=813.3}} or crude, self-made weapons (e.g. copies of the US [[Thompson submachine gun]]{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=187.2}} and [[shotgun]]s made of galvanized pipes).{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=994.1}} Most arms were captured from poorly defended ARVN militia outposts.{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=814.4}}\n\nCommunist forces were principally armed with Chinese and Soviet weaponry though some VC guerrilla units were equipped with Western infantry weapons either captured from French stocks during the first Indochina war, such as the [[MAT-49]], or from ARVN units or requisitioned through illicit purchase.\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1967, all Viet Cong battalions were reequipped with arms of Soviet design such as the [[AK-47]] assault rifle and the [[RPG-2]] anti-tank weapon.{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=1883.5}} Their weapons were principally of Chinese<ref>{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Seals|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/chinesesupport.aspx|title=Chinese Support for North Vietnam during the Vietnam War: The Decisive Edge|work=Military History Online|date=23 September 2008}}</ref> or Soviet manufacture.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Albert|last=Parray|magazine=Military Review|url=http://calldp.leavenworth.army.mil/eng_mr/txts/VOL47/00000006/art2.pdf|title=Soviet aid to Vietnam|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110428210157/http://calldp.leavenworth.army.mil/eng_mr/txts/VOL47/00000006/art2.pdf|archive-date=28 April 2011|url-status=dead|date=June 1967}}</ref> The period up to the conventional phase in the 1970, the Viet Cong and NVA were primarily limited to mortars, recoil-less rifles and small-arms and had significantly lighter equipment and firepower in comparison with the US arsenal, relying on ambushes alongside superior stealth, planning, marksmanship and small-unit tactics to face the disproportionate US technological advantage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jexmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT101|title=Indochina and Vietnam: The Thirty-five Year War, 1940\u20131975|last=Miller|first=Robert|last2=Wainstock|first2=Dennis D.|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1936274666|location=|pages=101\u201302|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany divisions within the NVA would incorporate armoured and mechanised battalions including the [[Type 59 tank]]., [[BTR-60]], [[D-74 122 mm field gun|Type 60 artillery]] and rapidly altered and integrated new war doctrines following the Tet Offensive into a mobile combined-arms force.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/north-vietnams-master-plan.htm|title=North Vietnam's Master Plan|website=HistoryNet|access-date=2018-06-01}}</ref> The North Vietnamese had both [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious tanks]] (such as the [[PT-76]]) and [[light tank]]s (such the [[Type 62]]) used during the conventional phase.

Often the gun suffered from a malfunction known as \"failure to extract\", which meant that the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a round was fired. According to a congressional report, the malfunction was caused by a change of gunpowder in the ammunition, which was done without adequate testing and by a money saving policy, headed by Robert S. McNamara, to not issue adequate cleaning kits to soldiers. This led to a myth of a self-cleaning gun. These decisions were made without regard to the safety of soldiers and resulted in many deaths.\n\nThe heavily armored, 90&nbsp;mm gun [[M48 Patton|M48A3 'Patton' tank]] saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with U.S. forces. They played an important role in infantry support though there were a  few tank versus tank battles. The [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank|M67A1 flamethrower tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam. Artillery was used extensively by both sides but the Americans were able to ferry the lightweight 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer]] by helicopter to remote locations on quick notice.<ref>Bart Hagerman, USA Airborne: 50th Anniversary, Turner Publishing Company, p.237</ref><ref name=\"Tolsonarmy\">{{cite book |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/vietnam/airmobility/airmobility-fm.html |title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961\u201371 |work = Department of the Army |author = Lieutenant General John J.

U.S. airpower was credited with breaking the [[Battle of Khe Sanh|siege of Khe Sanh]] and blunting the 1972 [[Easter Offensive]] against South Vietnam. At sea, the U.S. Navy had the run of the coastline, using aircraft carriers as platforms for offshore strikes and other naval vessels for offshore artillery support. Offshore naval fire played a pivotal role in the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]] in February 1968, providing accurate fire in support of the U.S. counter-offensive to retake the city.<ref>{{cite book|first=George W.|last=Smith|title=The siege at Hue|publisher= Lynne Reinner Publishers|date=1999|pp=142-143}}</ref>\n[[File:Khu_tr\u01b0ng_b\u00e0y_m\u00e1y_bay.JPG|thumb|Captured South Vietnamese warplanes in Ho Chi Minh City]]\nThe Vietnam War was the first conflict that saw wide scale tactical deployment of helicopters.<ref>Dwayne A.
