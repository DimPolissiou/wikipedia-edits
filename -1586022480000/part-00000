{"title_page": "Miniature Railway at Silver Lake, Ohio", "text_new": "[[File:Miniature Train built by Armitage - Herchell Co. of Niagara Falls, New York.jpg|thumb|[[Allan Herschell Company|Armitage-Herschell]] train around 1902]]\nThe '''Miniature Railway at Silver Lake, Ohio''' was a {{Track gauge|15in}} gauge [[miniature railway]] inaugurated by the Lodge family in 1902 at [[Silver Lake, Ohio]].\n\n== History ==\nThe [[ridable miniature railway]] was hauled by a scaled down steam locomotive, but the open passenger cars had no role model. The small locomotive was built around 1901 by the Armitage-Herschell Company of North Tonawanda in [[Niagara County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as park railways became increasingly popular. The locomotives of this manufacturer could pull up to ten passenger cars with seats for 40 children or 20 adults.<ref name=\"Daily\">[https://archive.org/stream/streetrailwayrev11amer/streetrailwayrev11amer#page/707/mode/1up Paying Park Attractions.] Daily Street Railway Review, Vol. XI (Vol. 11), No. 3, 11 October 1901, p. 707.</ref>\n\nThe steam locomotive, its tender and three passenger cars were purchased for a price of $1,050 for the locomotive and $75 for each car, equivalent to a price of $1.00 per pound, as the locomotive weighed 1,050 pounds. The [[Ohio Steel Company]] of [[Cuyahoga Falls]] made miniature rails with the unusually large weight of 16&nbsp;lb/yard (8&nbsp;kg/m), twice as heavy as those for other park railways, as well as switches and their [[flange-bearing frog]]s for 42 $/t.<ref Name=\"Lodge\">William R. Lodge (Manuskript): [http://www.villageofsilverlakeohio.com/railroad.html ''An Historical Anthology of Silver Lake.''] February 1947.</ref>\n\nThe railway loop began south of the large pavilion, built in 1898. The station was on the lakeshore at the boat landing dock. The route led along the lakeshore passing an old log cabin next to the later aquarium. It then passed the shooting gallery, the stone-built ice store, which was later rebuilt into the cage of the [[puma (genus)|puma]]s, as well as cages for monkeys, a wolf, raccoons, a badger and foxes. From there you could also see the aviaries for an eagle, hawks and owls and the bear pits. After the [[menagerie]], it led again along the lake, passed the ''Linwood'' log-cabin to another stretch along the lakeshore. This original route allowed the passengers a view of the lake and the zoo animals, which made the menagerie quickly known.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nHowever, the miniature railway with this original route was not as profitable as it should have been, because it was too far away from the main business. The following year, therefore, the track was laid along a new route with a long detour. This doubled the journey time, and the train journey became very popular. Over the years, the route has been changed several times.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nStarting in the second summer, the locomotive had to be repetitively repaired. Steamboat engineer Frank Jones was a valuable aid in repairing the locomotive and its parts. Nevertheless, the locomotive was taken out of service and offered for sale.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nSammy Wise. a [[Dwarfism|person of short stature]] from [[Loudonville, Ohio]], was employed as the first conductor of the park railway. He was just 48 inches (1.22 m) tall at the age of 28 when he came to Silver Lake. He was well-proportioned and self-important and very popular with campers and colleagues. In his uniform with a shiny lantern on his left arm and his ticket punch in his right hand, he was an attractive little conductor. He worked with the park railroad for several summers, until his death in the winter of 1906-1907.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\n[[File:'Travel Town Museum' 34.jpg|thumb|''Little General'' steam locomotive at [[Travel Town Museum]]]]\nGeorge Lodge was very enthusiastic about the train and the locomotive that he had built together with Frank Jones and Sammy Wise in 1903 for several months, using a new boiler of [[Biggs Boiler Works]] in [[Akron]].<ref name=\"Lodge\"/> In 1904 he built a more powerful locomotive, which was eventually called the ''Little General'' and is now on display in [[Travel Town Museum]].<ref>Daniel V. Markowitz: [http://www.villageofsilverlakeohio.com/lgeneral.html ''The \"Little General\" Miniature Train.'']</ref> After Frank Jones had died, he manufactured another even larger locomotive in his own workshop. He also built five new cars so that two trains with four cars each could drive at the same time.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nThe summer season of 1917 was the last time the park was operated, but the park railroad continued to be popular and in operation. The selling price of the park did not include the rails, locomotives and trains.

The small locomotive was built around 1901 by the Armitage-Herschell Company of North Tonawanda in [[Niagara County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as park railways became increasingly popular. The locomotives of this manufacturer could pull up to ten passenger cars with seats for 40 children or 20 adults.<ref name=\"Daily\">[https://archive.org/stream/streetrailwayrev11amer/streetrailwayrev11amer#page/707/mode/1up Paying Park Attractions.] Daily Street Railway Review, Vol. XI (Vol. 11), No. 3, 11 October 1901, p. 707.</ref>\n\nThe steam locomotive, its tender and three passenger cars were purchased for a price of $1,050 for the locomotive and $75 for each car, equivalent to a price of $1.00 per pound, as the locomotive weighed 1,050 pounds. The [[Ohio Steel Company]] of [[Cuyahoga Falls]] made miniature rails with the unusually large weight of 16&nbsp;lb/yard (8&nbsp;kg/m), twice as heavy as those for other park railways, as well as switches and their [[flange-bearing frog]]s for 42 $/t.<ref Name=\"Lodge\">William R. Lodge (Manuskript): [http://www.villageofsilverlakeohio.com/railroad.html ''An Historical Anthology of Silver Lake.''] February 1947.</ref>\n\nThe railway loop began south of the large pavilion, built in 1898. The station was on the lakeshore at the boat landing dock. The route led along the lakeshore passing an old log cabin next to the later aquarium. It then passed the shooting gallery, the stone-built ice store, which was later rebuilt into the cage of the [[puma (genus)|puma]]s, as well as cages for monkeys, a wolf, raccoons, a badger and foxes. From there you could also see the aviaries for an eagle, hawks and owls and the bear pits. After the [[menagerie]], it led again along the lake, passed the ''Linwood'' log-cabin to another stretch along the lakeshore. This original route allowed the passengers a view of the lake and the zoo animals, which made the menagerie quickly known.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nHowever, the miniature railway with this original route was not as profitable as it should have been, because it was too far away from the main business. The following year, therefore, the track was laid along a new route with a long detour. This doubled the journey time, and the train journey became very popular. Over the years, the route has been changed several times.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nStarting in the second summer, the locomotive had to be repetitively repaired. Steamboat engineer Frank Jones was a valuable aid in repairing the locomotive and its parts. Nevertheless, the locomotive was taken out of service and offered for sale.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nSammy Wise. a [[Dwarfism|person of short stature]] from [[Loudonville, Ohio]], was employed as the first conductor of the park railway. He was just 48 inches (1.22 m) tall at the age of 28 when he came to Silver Lake. He was well-proportioned and self-important and very popular with campers and colleagues. In his uniform with a shiny lantern on his left arm and his ticket punch in his right hand, he was an attractive little conductor. He worked with the park railroad for several summers, until his death in the winter of 1906-1907.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\n[[File:'Travel Town Museum' 34.jpg|thumb|''Little General'' steam locomotive at [[Travel Town Museum]]]]\nGeorge Lodge was very enthusiastic about the train and the locomotive that he had built together with Frank Jones and Sammy Wise in 1903 for several months, using a new boiler of [[Biggs Boiler Works]] in [[Akron]].<ref name=\"Lodge\"/> In 1904 he built a more powerful locomotive, which was eventually called the ''Little General'' and is now on display in [[Travel Town Museum]].<ref>Daniel V. Markowitz: [http://www.villageofsilverlakeohio.com/lgeneral.html ''The \"Little General\" Miniature Train.'']</ref> After Frank Jones had died, he manufactured another even larger locomotive in his own workshop. He also built five new cars so that two trains with four cars each could drive at the same time.<ref name=\"Lodge\"/>\n\nThe summer season of 1917 was the last time the park was operated, but the park railroad continued to be popular and in operation. The selling price price of the park did not include the rails, locomotives and trains. Since William Lodge could not find another buyer, he bought the rails<!--TBC--> and rolling stock for $1,000 and stored them on his farm. After a few years, he sold the locomotive and wagons to [[Buckeye Lake (Ohio)|Buckeye Lake Park Co.]] in [[Licking County]], Ohio.

The battle took place along the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] on the outskirts of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France between 15 and 25 August 1917.\n\nThe objectives of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the [[3rd Battle of Ypres]] and to make the German hold on Lens untenable.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=125}} The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire, some of which used the new technique of [[predicted fire]], would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the [[Ypres Salient]] but failed to draw in troops from other areas.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=132}}\n\nA later attempt by the Canadian Corps to extend its position into the city of Lens failed but the German and Canadian assessments of the battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective. The battle was costly for both sides and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]], including the new German [[Yellow Cross (chemical warfare)|Yellow Cross]] shell containing the blistering agent [[sulphur mustard]] (mustard gas).\n\n==Background==\n\n===Western front===\n\nBy May 1917, the [[Nivelle Offensive]], despite the successful opening of the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]], had come to a disastrous conclusion with the [[1917 French Army mutinies|French Army mutinies]].{{sfn|Delaney|2016|pp=6\u201310}} On 30 April, as the French hesitated to continue the [[Second Battle of the Aisne]] (16 April \u2013 9 May 1917), the commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], Field Marshal Sir [[Douglas Haig]], gave orders to the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] (General [[Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne|Henry Horne]]), to advance towards Lens to gain a line from M\u00e9ricourt to Sallaumines Hill, Lens and Hill 70. Horne already desired to cut off the salient containing Lens, to shorten the front, while unwilling to risk a costly and slow frontal assault into the maze of ruins. The First Army was understrength after the Battle of Arras but after the German [[Operation Alberich]] the withdrawal to the [[Hindenburg Line]] in March, there was some hope that the [[6th Army (German Empire)|6th Army]] (General [[Otto von Below]]) could be manoeuvred out of Lens by gradual advances to capture the higher ground to the south, west and north of the city.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nOn 7 May, Haig informed the British army commanders that the French had terminated the Nivelle Offensive and the strategy of returning to a war of manoeuvre. Operations to exhaust the powers of resistance of the German armies would resume by systematic surprise attacks  and when this was complete, the British would begin an offensive at Ypres to capture the Belgian coast and reach the frontier with the Netherlands.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80\u201381}} The objectives of the First Army were unchanged but instead of capturing ground around Lens to shorten the front, the intention was to menace the German hold on Lens and the defences south of Lille, to distract, divert and weaken the defenders. The operations were not a diversion but a means to keep the First Army front active for as long as possible, to mislead the Germans as to British intentions in Flanders.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80\u201381}} On 8 May, Horne told the corps commanders that\n\n{{quote|The ruling principles in the conduct of these operations will be careful selection of important objectives of a limited nature, deliberate preparation of the attack, concentration or artillery and economy of infantry, combined in each case with feint attacks and smoke and gas on other positions of the front.|First Army GS 651, 8 May 1917{{sfn|Humphries|2016|p=81}}}}\n\n===Lens===\n[[File:An Impression of Lens, France, Seen from an Aeroplane- the Anglo-german Front Line, 1918 Art.IWMART2661.jpg|thumb|{{centre|\"An Impression of Lens, France, Seen from an Aeroplane, the Anglo-German Front Line, 1918\" ([[Richard Carline]] Art.IWMART2661)}}]]\nFrom Vimy Ridge the ground declines about {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} into the Douai Plain; the valley of the Souchez river is about {{convert|20|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and flows south-west to north-east through the south of the city of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]. In 1914, the river had several road and rail bridges. By 1917, much of the city was derelict due to years of artillery bombardments, the ruins being natural strongpoints overlooked by {{lang|fr|crassiers}} (slag heaps) and several hills, including Hill 70, Hill 65 and Sallaumines Hill. The city is in a shallow, saucer-shaped depression surrounded by the {{lang|fr|crassiers}} and hills. To the south-east, on terrain that is {{convert|25|to|45|m|ft|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} above sea level, Sallaumines Hill rises to {{convert|55|m|ft|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. On the west side of Lens is Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill) north of the Souchez, which is steep-sided and gives a fine view of the city.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nTo the north-west, on the east side of the Lens\u2013Bethune road is a hill about {{convert|70|m|ft|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} high with the suburb of Cit\u00e9 St Pierre on top. Hill 70 is north of the city and has a flat top, giving a fine view of the city and the ground to the north and east. The hill slopes gently towards Lens and there is a shallow depression between it and Cit\u00e9 St Pierre. The slopes of Hill 70 towards Cit\u00e9 St Auguste are steeper.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=79\u201380}} Lens, Hill 70, Sallaumines and Sallaumines Hill to the south-east and their commanding views over the area and the city, fell under German control in October 1914, during the [[Race to the Sea]].{{sfn|Burg|Purcell|2004|p=29}} In September 1915, the British overran the hill during the [[Battle of Loos]] but it was recaptured by the Germans.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=171}}\n\n===Local operations===\n\nHorne began to make plans for the capture of Lens during the [[Battle of Arras (1917)#Third Battle of the Scarpe (3\u20134 May 1917)|Third Battle of the Scarpe]] (3\u20134 May). Horne wanted the Canadian Corps to continue its operations east of [[Vimy Ridge]] to capture M\u00e9ricourt and La Coulotte, which would endanger the German defences of Sallaumines Hill, south-east of Lens, as [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Arthur Holland (British Army officer)|Arthur Holland]]) north of the Souchez, with twelve tanks, captured Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill) and Hill 70. The attacks would envelop Lens on three sides and give [[Artillery observer|forward observation officers]] (FOO) sight of the German defences in the city, potentially to force the 6th Army to retire without the need for a frontal attack. In May, Holland had surveyed the I Corps front, noted that the tactical value of Hill 70 and that it would be inevitable that the Germans would make great efforts to re-capture the hill. German counter-attacks could only be resisted if plenty of reserves and much artillery support were made available. Deliberate attacks to capture the high ground around Lens would meet the goals of the First Army despite its limited means.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80, 82}} In May and early June, First Army units conducted eighteen raids and minor actions, moving the front line slowly eastwards over the Douai Plain. By 6 June, the First Army had captured all the high ground in the area, except that around Lens. I Corps was west of the city from the Souchez north to Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill), through {{lang|fr|Cit\u00e9 St Theodore}} and along the ridge of the 70-metre hill to the north of Cit\u00e9 St Pierre.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=82}}\n\nOn 9 June, the commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant-General [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]] was promoted and assumed command the [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]]. [[Arthur Currie]], the [[1st Canadian Division]] commander, was promoted in his place.{{sfn|Granatstein|2004|pp=118\u2013119}} On 10 June, Holland told Horne that only the capture of Hill 70 was important and suggested inflicting mass casualties by raids, bombardments and gas attacks, to create the impression that a big attack was imminent. The defenders would be subjected to anxiety and have to move more troops and artillery to the hill, despite the inevitable losses. Horne doubted that the army had sufficient men and artillery for the task and arranged for the [[46th (North Midland) Division]], on the right of I Corps, to make preparations to take Hill 70 and the vicinity but only if reinforcements from GHQ were forthcoming. While waiting, I Corps would capture Hill 65 and south of the Souchez, XIII Corps and the right hand divisions of the Canadian Corps would prepare to attack from Gavrelle to Oppy, Fresnoy, Acheville and M\u0117ricourt, digging jumping-off trenches to simulate a threat to Lens from the south. The real attack was to come from the left flank of the Canadian Corps towards Sallaumines Hill and the east end of Avion. Success would trap the Germans in Lens between Sallaumines Hill to the south and Hill 70 to the north. If the 6th Army did not retire, the preparations by I Corps at Hill 70 would make it impossible to predict from which direction the next attack would come.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|p=83}}\n\n====Affairs south of the Souchez====\n{{see also|Capture of Oppy Wood}}\n\n[[File:Deule.png|thumb|{{centre|Diagram of the Souchez River and associated canal system}}]]\nTo create a threat to Lens, Horne intended that XIII Corps on the southern flank would attack to reach better positions between the villages of Gavrelle and Oppy by advancing the front line for {{convert|200|to|500|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|2300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} front. The [[4th Canadian Division]] on the left flank of the Canadian Corps south of the [[Souchez]] River (a tributary of the [[De\u00fble]]) and the 46th (North Midland) Division on the right of I Corps, north of the river, were to attack on a front of {{convert|4800|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} to eliminate a German salient from [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]] to the west end of Lens and to occupy Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill). I Corps was to plan for an attack on Hill 70 with the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]] on the left (northern) flank. Horne expected that the operations would take place in early July but found that many of the best heavy guns were to be sent to Flanders and brought forward the date to 28 June. The plans were made less ambitious; the XIII Corps scheme was retained but the attack either side of the Souchez was reduced to the capture the German front line west of Avion and Hill 65; the Hill 70 plan was postponed.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n28 June was dull, humid and storm clouds appeared in the south over the afternoon. The First Army artillery, assisted by Third Army guns en route to Flanders, began a bombardment along the {{convert|14|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} army front from [[Gavrelle]] to [[Hulluch]]. The simulation of a much bigger attack on Lens was enhanced by lightning, thunder and a downpour, which began at {{nowrap|7:10 p.m.}} when the infantry advance began. The adjacent brigades of the 31st and 5th divisions had been bombarded in their jumping-off trenches at {{nowrap|5:30 p.m.}} and suffered 200 casualties before the advance began. The survivors moved so fast that when a German counter-barrage fell on no man's land three minutes later, the British were on the far side and unharmed. The attackers suffered few casualties, took {{nowrap|200 prisoners}} and counted {{nowrap|280 dead}} German soldiers. Gavrelle Mill and a new line was consolidated, despite the rainstorm, from which the areas to the north-east and east around [[Neuvireuil]] and [[Fresnes-l\u00e8s-Montauban|Fresnes]] could be observed, along with Greenland Hill to the south-west.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n====Capture of Avion====\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62771.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Avion, Sallaumines and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62065)}}]]\nOrders from the First Army HQ reached Currie on 12 June, who replied with a suggestion that the capture of Hill 65 was tactically desirable to gain observation over Lens and to deprive the Germans of reciprocal observation of the British rear. The capture of Avion could be replaced by a raid, to avoid the casualties of a permanent occupation. Preparations for offensive operations towards Avion would be more meaningful to German observers than the attack which followed. The suggested alternative was not well received by Major-general W. H. Anderson, the First Army chief of staff, because one purpose of the operation was to threaten Lille, which could only occur with the capture of Lens, after the attack on Avion. The Canadian operation was only a stage in the plan, to be followed by an attack or decoy towards Sallaumines Hill. A few days later more artillery was transferred to Flanders, which led to the postponement of the Hill 70 attack.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nFurther north, opposite the 4th Canadian and 46th (North Midland) divisions, the German [[56th Infantry Division (German Empire)|56th Division]] had on 22 June, moved into reserve to substitute for a division transferred to Flanders. The division holding the line had orders to retire from the salient to the Avion\u2013Lens railway if pressed. The western slopes of Hill 65 had been occupied on 24 June after a German retirement and patrols pushed forward towards Avion Trench, which was taken early on 28 June. The divisions made ready to resume the advance when the army barrage began at {{nowrap|7:10 p.m.}} Most of Avion, [[\u00c9leu-dit-Leauwette]] and the eastern slope of Hill 65 was captured, as the [[3rd Canadian Division]] formed a defensive flank along the [[Arleux]]\u2013Avion road, joining with the 4th Canadian Division in Avion. Rain and the flooding from the Souchez stopped patrols from probing the German main line of resistance in the north-eastern part of Avion and along a railway embankment about {{nowrap|600|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} further on.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===First Army===\n[[File:Lens-Position.png|thumb|Location of Lens]]\nThe Canadian Corps (Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie) had the 1st, 2nd and 4th Canadian divisions for the attack and the 3rd Canadian Division in reserve. Artillery planning was delegated to Major [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] who had 240 [[QF 18-pounder gun|18-pounder]] field guns and 78 [[QF 4.5-inch howitzer|4.5-inch]] howitzers of the Canadian Corps field artillery, 31 of the 18-pounders being unusable due to barrel-wear. I Corps contributed twelve more 18-pounders and XIII Corps eighteen. Brooke also had 38 batteries of heavy siege howitzers consisting of twenty [[BL 9.2-inch howitzer|9.2-inch howitzers]], twenty [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI \u2013 VIII|8-inch howitzers]], eighty [[BL 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer|6-inch howitzers]], 42 [[BL 60-pounder gun|60-pounder guns]] and two [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|6-inch guns]]. The British contributed 28 batteries but approximately 25 per cent of the heavy artillery for the operation was of dubious value due to barrel wear. Twenty batteries were in three Heavy Artillery Groups (HAGs) for destructive bombardment, and 18 batteries in three HAGs for counter-battery-fire, four British and two Canadian.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=108\u2013109}}{{efn|From 1916, siege batteries were affiliated temporarily to a HAG and HAGs were sent to corps as necessary.{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=109}}}}\n\n===6th Army===\nThe 6th Army was responsible for the defence of the area between Lille and Cambrai, Lens being about halfway between. The town was an important railway junction and after the Battle of Arras, earlier in 1917, had become a salient in the German defences. Hill 70 and the vicinity was held by the [[7th Division (German Empire)|7th Division]], part of {{lang|de|Gruppe Loos}}, the headquarters of [[IV Corps (German Empire)|IV Corps]]. (The German army had begun to use corps headquarters as territorial command units, rather than of a permanent complement of divisions, during the Battle of the Somme.){{sfn|Edmonds|1991|loc=p. 226 (footnote)}} Lens was garrisoned by the [[11th Reserve Division (German Empire)|11th Reserve Division]] in {{lang|de|Gruppe Souchez}} ([[VI Corps (German Empire)|VI Corps]]).

In the south the Canadian Corps was to attack beyond Avion to a railway embankment, ready to advance to Sallaumines Hill. Soon afterwards, GHQ announced that more artillery would be forthcoming and Horne met the corps commanders again on 10 July; Currie wanted to make the main effort north of the Souchez, the Canadian Corps taking responsibility for the front from Avion to Hill 70. Horne agreed and on 11 July, Currie issued the first orders for the attack. The Canadian plan for 30 July used the I Corps plan for the abortive June attack as a basis; the scheduled attack to the embankment east of Avion was to go ahead, to obtain a good jumping off point for a later advance on Sallaumines Hill to mislead the defenders about preparations for an attack. From 11 to 19 July, Canadian Corps intelligence discovered that German dispositions had changed. A new third defensive line had been completed along the northern outskirts of the city, from Cinnabar Trench along Nun's Alley, Norman Trench, Hugo Trench to Bois Hugo, beyond the objectives given to Currie on 10 July. The position had three thick belts of barbed wire, a light railway for supply and eleven strongpoints with fields of fire into Commotion Trench, the final Canadian objective. The new position was judged to have become the main German defence line.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=87\u201389}}\n\nHill 70 overlooked Lens and the Douai plain and Currie believed that the Germans would commit troops that they could ill-afford to lose, to regain a position that they dared not leave in Canadian possession. Artillery observers on the hill could defeat German counter-attacks with accurate artillery-fire.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=285}} The hill was to be occupied quickly and strongpoint defensive positions were to be established around the {{nowrap|48 [[Vickers machine gun]]s}} allocated to each brigade. A combination of small-arms and artillery firepower would defeat German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=1992|1pp=74\u201375|2a1=Walthert|2y=2015|2p=23}} The 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions were to attack on a front of {{convert|4000|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} to a depth of {{convert|1500|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} and capture the main enemy defensive positions on the eastern (reverse) slope of Hill 70. In the first stage, the first objective of the attackers was the German front-line, the second objective (blue line) was the German second position on the crest of the hill and the third objective (green line) was the German third line, on the far slope, about {{convert|1500|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} from the start line. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division would attack north of Hill 70 and its 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade would attack the summit.{{sfn|Bell|1992|p=75}} The 4th and 5th Canadian Infantry Brigades of the 2nd Canadian Division would attack the ruins of suburbs {{lang|fr|Cit\u00e9 St \u00c9douard}}, {{lang|fr|St Laurent}} and {{lang|fr|St \u00c9mile}} directly south of the hill.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\nBy 16 July, the 1st Canadian Division infantry had transferred from the south-west of Lens to the north-western fringe of Hill 70. On 22 July, the divisional artillery arrived and by 25 July was in position from the south of Li\u00e9vin to [[Grenay, Pas-de-Calais|Bully-Grenay]], among mine workings, slag heaps and ruined villages, many next to light rail lines, the Canadians having inherited the preliminary work done by I Corps. Wire-cutting had been going on since 11 July but there was no time for the fifteen-day preliminary bombardment laid down in the artillery plan of 11 July. On 26 July the last orders were issued and a document \"Canadian Corps Scheme of Operations\" by the [[Brigadier-General]], [[General Staff]] (BGGS), Percy Radcliffe set 30 July as the date of the attack, to coincide with the Flanders Offensive. Heavy rains reduced the area to a swamp, grounded the RFC, which provided information on the progress of the bombardment, some guns were late arriving and others had too many defects to use for wire-cutting. The attack was postponed and despite the mediocre state of many of the guns, the bombardment continued into August and several creeping barrages were fired to provoke German counter-barrages and reveal German gun positions. The 15th, 50th and 2nd Canadian Heavy Artillery Group bombarded German gun positions revealed by aerial photographs, [[flash spotting]] and [[Artillery sound ranging|sound ranging]], neutralisation being more effective than destruction.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\n====Artillery====\nFor the {{nowrap|attack, 204}} eighteen-pounders and forty-eight {{nowrap|4.5-inch howitzers}} were to fire a creeping barrage; the 1st Canadian Division front {{nowrap|had 72}} eighteen-pounders from the 1st and 3rd Canadian divisional artilleries and thirty field guns from the British, {{nowrap|18 from}} the 14th Army Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA), six from the 53rd Battery and six from the 112th Battery. The 2nd Canadian Division had its {{nowrap|36 divisional}} eighteen-pounders and another {{nowrap|76 British}} {{nowrap|guns, 36}} eighteen-pounders of the 46th (North Midland) divisional artillery, twelve 18-pounders of the 179th Army Field Brigade and another {{nowrap|18 from}} the 120th, 165th and 317th batteries. All of the 4.5-inch howitzers were from the 2nd Canadian divisional artillery, making sixty Canadian and {{nowrap|76 British}} guns. The attack had {{nowrap|318 field}} guns and howitzers, with {{nowrap|164 siege}} guns and howitzers, with {{nowrap|300,000 18-pounder}} shells, {{nowrap|150,000 4.5-inch}} and more than {{nowrap|250,000 heavy}} artillery rounds. The Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery HQ had the 63rd, 64th Heavy Artillery Groups HAG) with eight siege batteries each and the Canadian Heavy Artillery Group with five, for wire-cutting and trench destruction. Barrel wear and general unreliability meant that about half of the 18-pounders could not be used in the preliminary bombardment. {{nowrap|About 165}} eighteen-pounders were to fire the first layer of the creeping barrage, with the infantry advancing about {{cvt|75|yd|m|0}} behind. To make it harder for the German artillery to bombard the infantry by following the creeping barrage, the rest of the 18-pounders and some 4.5-inch howitzers were to fire a barrage {{cvt|200|yd|m|0}} further forward; 6-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers were to fire {{cvt|100|to|200|yd|m|0}} beyond the second barrage line.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nThe 15th, 50th and 2nd Canadian Heavy Artillery Group had {{nowrap|111 artillery}} pieces, from 60-pounder guns to 9.2-inch howitzers and four super heavy [[BL 12-inch Mk X naval gun|12-inch gun]] and one [[BL 15-inch howitzer|15-inch howitzer]]. The 12-inch guns had the ammunition for eighty rounds-per-day-per-gun for fifteen days. High explosive, gas and shrapnel shells were to be fired at German gun positions revealed by RFC reconnaissance photographs and the flash-spotters and sound rangers, to kill gunners and supply horses. One report had the 6th Army artillery in nine groups of {{nowrap|70\u201380 guns,}} half of them field guns and half of them heavy. On the eve of the attack, the counter-batteries claimed that forty of 102 German guns had been knocked out. Many of the field guns were beyond the range of Hill 70 but I Corps on the northern (left) flank and XIII Corps on the southern (right) flank were to induce German guns to reply to harassing fire. The counter-batteries were also to be used to destroy German counter-attacks and soon after zero hour, guns from the bombardment HAGs were to join in with the counter-battery HAGs against German infantry counter-attacks. Forward Observation Observers were to accompany the Canadian infantry and establish observation posts connected to the rear with telephones, wireless and visual signalling equipment to direct the artillery.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n====Gas====\nBy 1917, gas was delivered by shell, the substances being classed as lethal, harassing and persistent; lethal types were chlorine, phosgene and diphosgene, the phosgene types having little colour or smell. Harassing gases were non-lethal and included tear gas to compel the opponents to wear their gas masks. Catching troops not wearing gas masks with a lethal concentration of gas was difficult but phosgene bombardments could cause casualties, slow the completion of tasks and tire the victims. The Canadians collected {{nowrap|15,000}} 4.5-inch and 60-pounder gas shells for the operation. Before the attack, the Royal Engineers bombarded the German defences with {{nowrap|3,500 drums}} ({{cvt|46|LT|t|0}}) of gas fired from [[Livens Projector]]s. Two prisoners of Infantry Regiment 156 said that their companies of eighty men and 56 men had suffered twenty and 29 gas casualties. A prisoner from Infantry Regiment 22 said that two companies had suffered 90 gas casualties.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\n====Machine-guns====\n\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|alt=Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917|{{centre|Example of a Vickers gun in action}}]]\nSixteen companies from the Canadian Machine Gun Corps with 128 Vickers machine guns and the armoured cars of the Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade (CMMGB) with 32 guns, under the command of the divisions were to supplement the artillery by firing a barrage over the heads of the Canadian infantry. The harassing machine-gun fire was to impede the movement of German troops and supplies, with targets engaged by at least four guns. The Vickers guns were supplied with 20,000 bullets per gun per day, to fire day and night, to make it more difficult for German troops to repair their defences and put out more barbed wire. The cars of the CMMGB drove back and forth behind Canadian lines and from mid-July to early August fired {{nowrap|2,694,700 rounds;}} including the static guns about ten million rounds were fired before the Canadian attack. When the hill was captured, {{nowrap|48 Vickers}} guns were to be dug in, one for every {{cvt|35|yd|m|0}} of front, guarded but several infantry sections.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n====Royal Flying Corps====\n\n{{main|Royal Flying Corps}}\n\nThe Canadian Corps had [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|16 Squadron]] ([[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|BE2cs]]), [[No. 40 Squadron RAF|40 Squadron]] ([[Nieuport 17]]s) and [[No. 43 Squadron RAF|43 Squadron]] ([[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter]]s)<!--a proper name not a fraction--> RFC in support and the Sopwith Camels of [[No. 208 Squadron RAF|8 (Naval) Squadron]], [[Royal Naval Air Service]] for high patrols over the battlefield. An advanced landing ground at Petit Sains was made ready for 43 Squadron Strutters to mount continuous, counter-attack reconnaissance patrols. Formations of three Strutters were to observe an area {{convert|7000|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1,500|to|2500|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} deep, that counter-attacking German troops would have to traverse. The Strutter crews were to report their observations by wireless to the Canadian Corps and Heavy Artillery Group headquarters, then attack with their machine-guns any German artillery or concentrations of troops seen at bottlenecks. Contact patrols to mark the progress of the Canadian infantry were to be flown by the B.E.2c crews of 16 Squadron.{{sfnm|1a1=Wise|1y=1981|1p=422|2a1=Edmonds|2y=1991|2p=221}}\n\nOn 9 August, six 40 Squadron Nieuport 17s made a low-level attack on the six German observation balloons along the Hill 70\u2013Lens front and shot them down. German artillery observation was obstructed but the attack made the Canadian interest in the area obvious. For the two days and nights before the attack, [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|10 Squadron]], [[No. 25 Squadron RAF|25 Squadron]] ([[Airco DH.4|DH.4]]) and [[No. 27 Squadron RAF|27 Squadron]] ([[Martinsyde G.100|Martinsyde Elephant]]) bombed railway junctions, airfields and billets. In earlier battles, British fighters patrolling at height to engage German fighters had not been able to see low-flying, camouflaged German aircraft, which flew artillery-observation and ground attack sorties without interference. Six Nieuport 17s of 40 Squadron moved to an advanced landing ground at [[Mazingarbe]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the front and a ground station was established on the heights west of Loos. When observers spotted a German aircraft at low altitude, a wireless message was sent to Mazingarbe for a Nieuport 17 to be sent up to engage the German aircraft. A letter-code on white canvas sheets containing the location of German aircraft could be laid on the ground for an airborne fighter pilot to read.{{sfn|Wise|1981|p=422}}\n\n====Deception operations====\n[[File:Hill 70 - Map of harassing fire.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Artillery map of the Lens area, marking locations to bombard with harassing fire.}}]]\nBy 16 July, the Canadian Corps had redeployed for the attack on Hill 70; the 1st Canadian Division had taken over from I Corps to the north-west of the hill, and the Canadian Corps occupied a line from the Souchez River northwards to just beyond Hill 70. To deceive the Germans about the place and size of the attack and to disguise Canadian preparations, the XIII, Canadian, I and XI, corps began to conduct larger raids in battalion strength, on most nights from the middle of July, along with gas discharges along the front. Towards the end of the month, raids and bombardments on the army front increased, XI Corps to the north raided nightly, I Corps conducted destructive and wire-cutting bombardments at night and bombarded the German front with machine-guns and mortars during the day; XIII Corps conducted similar operations on the right (southern) army flank.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1962|1p=285|2a1=Gardner|2y=2016|2pp=39\u201340}}\n\nIn late July, the 9th Canadian Brigade feinted a direct attack of Lens by engaging units of the German [[36th Reserve Division (German Empire)|36th Reserve Division]] at M\u00e9ricourt Trench.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1962|1p=285|2a1=Farr|2y=2007|2p=171|3a1=Walthert|3y=2015|3p=23}} Bad weather led to the attack on Hill 70 being postponed from late July until mid-August. In the interim, special companies of the [[Royal Engineers]] augmented the regular level of bombardment by firing {{nowrap|3,500 gas}} drums from Livens projectors and {{nowrap|900 gas}} shells into Lens by 15 August. The artillery neutralized {{nowrap|40 out}} of an estimated {{nowrap|102 German}} batteries in the area by zero hour, partly using the technique of [[predicted fire]] using datum points and calibrated guns for the first time, which greatly improved the accuracy of the artillery.{{sfn|Farndale|1986|p=205}} Troops were rotated through the reserve area to conduct training and rehearsals in preparation for the assault.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=286}} On the northern (left) flank, the 46th (North Midland) Division made a diversionary attack north of the hill, with [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] discharges, artillery bombardments and the preparation of dummy tanks and troops on the two nights before the attack to be exposed to view at zero hour.{{sfn|Gardner|2016|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n==Battle==\n===15 August===\n\n[[File:Hill 70 - Water tanks in ruined house.jpg|thumb|left|upright|{{centre|A ruined house west of Lens, used to shelter water tanks.}}]]\nDuring the night of {{nowrap|14/15 August}} the Canadian infantry assembled in their jumping-off points; harassing fire from German artillery continued but with no particular intensity.{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=118}} The Germans had moved up reserves on the previous night in anticipation of an attack and the main assembly of Canadian troops was detected by {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}}{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=287\u2013289}} At {{nowrap|4:25 a.m.}} the Canadian creeping barrage began and the infantry advanced, some troops having left their trenches early to avoid the German counter-barrage expected as soon as the attack began. At {{nowrap|4:26 a.m.}} Special Companies RE fired {{nowrap|400 drums}} of oil from Livens projectors, which dropped into the German defences in Cit\u00e9 St \u00c9lisabeth, creating a smoke-screen and began an hour-long smoke bombardment from 4-inch Stokes mortars.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=118\u2013119}} Artillery Forward Observation Officers moved forward with the infantry and artillery-observation aircraft flew overhead sending {{nowrap|240 calls}} for artillery fire by wireless that day.{{sfn|Farndale|1986|p=205}}{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=287\u2013289}}\n\nIn the 1st Canadian Division area, 4 Special Company RE fired mortars and Livens projectors against the left flank of the attack, as a deception and to shield the attack front from observers on higher ground several miles to the north. On the right (southern) flank in the 4th Canadian Division area, a Special Company used Livens projectors to fire {{nowrap|200 gas}} cylinders into German positions around Avion.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=118\u2013119}} After four minutes, the creeping barrage began to  move in {{cvt|100|yd|m|0}} increments, keeping about 25 percent of the ground to be crossed under bombardment. Vickers gunners fired a machine-gun barrage at maximum range then gradually fired shorter towards the German positions. The Canadian infantry reached the blue line, {{cvt|600|yd|m|0}} forward in twenty minutes and paused to dig in. The advance began again and reached the final objective (red line) at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} German resistance was determined and the Canadians used Lewis guns to pin down the German infantry as rifle- and bombing-sections attacked from a flank. On the southern (right) flank, the 4th Canadian Division diversion succeeded and with fewer guns in support, the German artillery reply was more effective than further north. The 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade anticipated the German artillery bombardment and the Canadians took cover in deep shelters in the edge of Lens, the brigade suffering fewer than 24 casualties during the first day.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=119\u2013121}}\n\nThe four attacking Canadian brigades began to consolidate as soon as they reached their objectives and each brigade emplaced 48 Vickers guns in its section of the blue line. Connexions to the artillery were established by observers with field telephones, wireless and signal lamps and the artillery changed from bombardment and creeping barrage fire to be ready to fire SOS barrages against German counter-attacks. At about {{nowrap|8:15 a.m.}} the 4th Guard Division began the first German attack, having been seen assembling in Cit\u00e9 St Auguste. The Germans had to move over about {{cvt|0.75|mi|km|0}} of open ground and the Canadian gun-, machine-gun- and rifle-fire covered the ground with corpses and wounded. An attack at {{nowrap|12:45 p.m.}} met the same fate, the few Germans reaching the Canadians being bombed out. German counter-attacks continued and the German artillery still in action tried to support the attacks and shell the Canadian defences. A counter-attack at {{nowrap|1:15 p.m.}} was prepared by German heavy artillery, which cut many of the field telephone links to the Canadian artillery but some remained operational and several runners got through with messages. The 2nd Canadian Division artillery received the message \"Please turn Artillery on.\" and did, repulsing the attack; the Canadian gunners did the same to another German attempt at {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} Canadian machine-gunners fired all day, seven guns of the 3rd Canadian Machine Gun Company firing {{nowrap|5,000 rounds}} in a few minutes.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=121\u2013122}}{{efn|The 3rd Canadian Machine Gun Company fired {{nowrap|271,000 rounds}} during the battle and the 8th Canadian Machine Gun {{nowrap|Company 360,000.}}{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=122}}}}\n\n===Air operations===\nThe Sopwith&nbsp;{{frac|1|1|2}}&nbsp;Strutters of 43 Squadron received many hits from ground fire but only two were shot down, three crew being wounded; a German aircraft was shot down and others driven off but four more Sopwith&nbsp;{{frac|1|1|2}}&nbsp;Strutters were too badly damaged to be serviceable for 16 August.

Between {{nowrap|7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.}} on the morning of 15 August, the Germans executed four local attacks against Canadian positions. Each attack was repulsed due in large part to the work of forward artillery observers, who could now overlook some of the German positions. On one occasion, a German counter-attack was only repulsed after engaging in hand-to-hand fighting. The Germans rapidly brought up seven additional battalions from the 4th Guards Division and 185th Division to reinforce the eight line battalions. Over the following three days, the Germans counter-attacked 21 times against Canadian positions.{{sfn|Cook|2000|pp=129, 131}} A frontal attack against the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade on the afternoon of 15 August ultimately failed.

The attack was costly as the Germans opposite were preparing their own counter-attack and hand-to-hand fighting took place at the chalk quarry, which cost the Germans 100 fatal casualties, 100 wounded and thirty prisoners. The Germans began to counter-attack at {{nowrap|7:15 p.m.}} after a delay but good observation enabled the attacks to be repulsed by massed artillery-fire, machine-gun fire and the fire of the Canadian infantry. To the south, the 5th Canadian Battalion retired about {{cvt|200|yd|m|0}} from the final objective to shell-holes, after suffering many casualties and running short of ammunition.The brigade suffered {{nowrap|249 men}} killed, {{nowrap|1,177 men}} wounded and {{nowrap|225 men}} missing.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1962|1pp=290\u2013291|2a1=Edmonds|2y=1991|2p=227}}\n\nAttempts by the 4th and 11th Canadian Infantry Brigades to eliminate a German salient between Cit\u00e9 St \u00c9lisabeth and Lens on 17 August failed and as had been foreseen, the Germans continued to mount determined counter-attacks. The German commanders realized that the Canadian and British artillery would need to be neutralized before a counter-attack could succeed. The Germans began a series of counter-attacks against a chalk quarry under Canadian control outside Cit\u00e9 St. Auguste and tried to mislead the Canadian artillery by sending up false flare signals or provoking the infantry to call for unnecessary artillery fire.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=130}} The Germans stopped wave attacks and counter-attacked with dispersed groups of troops trickling forward using cover; some managed to reach the Canadian defences and fight hand-to-hand.{{sfn|Cook|2009|p=289}} The Germans began to use poison gas in earnest and from 15,000 to 20,000 of the new [[Yellow Cross (chemical warfare)|Yellow Cross]] shells, containing the blistering agent [[sulphur mustard]], were fired in addition to [[diphosgene|Green Cross]] (diphosgene) shells. The positions of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Artillery Field Brigades and the Canadian front line were gassed.

For the Canadian Corps, the following two days consisted largely of consolidation. The front line was drawn back {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, midway between the original intermediate and final objectives. The 4th Canadian Division slightly advanced its forward posts on the outskirts of Lens and extended its front northward to include the Lens\u2013B\u00e9thune road. Currie wished to further improve the position around Hill 70 and ordered an attack against German positions along a {{convert|3000|yd|mi+km|abbr=on}} front, opposite the 2nd and 4th Canadian Divisions.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=293}}\n\n===21\u201322 August (Attack on Lens)===\nThe operation was scheduled for the morning of 21 August, the tasks being divided between the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade on the left and the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade on the right. The attack was to begin at {{nowrap|4:35 a.m.}} but the Germans began shelling the Canadian positions at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} Just before the Canadian attack, the left flank of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade was attacked by units of the 4th Guard Division and a battalion of the 220th Division. The forces met between their objectives and fought hand-to-hand and with the bayonet; in the ''m\u00e9l\u00e9e'' the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade advance was stopped and the troops forced back to their start line. Communication between the forward units and brigade headquarters had broken down at the beginning of the attack and could not be restored due to the German bombardment, making it all but impossible to co-ordinate the infantry and artillery.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=293\u2013295}}\n\nOn the right flank, a unit of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered a large number of casualties to the German artillery while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire, near its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives late in the evening, creating a salient in the 4th Canadian Division line. On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful and an attack on 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking the Green Crassier slag heap and the mine complex at Fosse St Louis. The attack was repulsed, most of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Arthur Ambrose McEvoy - Official Portrait of Filip Konowal.jpg|thumb|upright|{{centre|Corporal Filip Konowal, the only Ukrainian Victoria Cross recipient.}}]]\nOn 15 August, Haig made a diary note that the attack had gone \"very well\"; Horne called it \"an unqualified success\", despite the failure of the 6th Army to retreat and began to plan an attack on Sallaumines Hill for early September.{{sfn|Gardner|2016|p=44}} In 1942, the writers of {{lang|de|Der Weltkrieg}}, the German official history (volume XIII), wrote that since mid-July, the German defences at Lens and for about {{convert|7|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the north had been under bombardment, which became more intense in August because Haig wanted a diversion from the offensive in Flanders. On 15 August, the Canadian Corps attacked the German positions from Lens to about {{convert|2|km|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} north, took an important height [Hill 70] for observation and pushed beyond the First Position ({{lang|de|I Stellung}}). Counter-attacks recaptured pockets of ground but the Canadians could not be expelled from {{lang|de|I Stellung}}.

The Canadian plan had succeeded but had depended on the determination of the Canadian infantry against equally determined opponents, who suffered approximately {{nowrap|20,000 casualties,}} against {{nowrap|5,600 Canadian.}} The attack ended on 25 August and was a considerable victory despite the Germans retaining their hold on occupation of Lens. Two German divisions intended for Flanders had been diverted to Hill 70 and the reinforcement plan for the fighting at Ypres had been dislocated. Cook called the battle the most one-sided German defeat apart from the Battle of Messines in June. The attacks into Lens had been \"clumsy, hurried affairs\" and that the Canadians suffered nearly {{nowrap|4,000 casualties}} from 21 to 25 August. The frontal attacks on 21 and 23 August were rash and demonstrated that Currie lacked experience; Cook placed blame on Watson and Hilliam, the latter of whom should have been sacked.{{sfn|Cook|2009|pp=295, 306}}\n\nIn 2016, Robert Foley wrote that Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht and the 6th Army headquarters thought that the Canadian advance had been stopped by 16 August. Below wrote in his diary that more than ten attacks by the Canadians, \"the best English (sic) troops\", had been repulsed. The Canadian attack had been stopped because the \"English\" lacked the flexibility to exploit success, a criticism that had emerged during the Battle of the Somme in 1916.{{sfn|Foley|2016|pp=198\u2013199}} The Canadian attack was seen as a feint to divert German divisions from Flanders and the army group ordered the 6th Army to fight with its own resources, including the seven divisions in army reserve. The 4th Guard and the 220th divisions acted as {{lang|de|[[Eingreif division|Eingreifdivisionen]]}} on 15 August and with the existing divisions, conducted most of the German defence. Once the German counter-attack in 15 August had failed, the attempt to recapture Hill 70 was abandoned and counter-attacks were restricted local efforts to repulse Canadian attacks and for tactical improvements to the German defences. Two divisions were moved from reserve to replace the 4th Guard and the 220th divisions, three more divisions in reserve remaining available to the 6th Army. No forces were transferred to Lens from Flanders or anywhere else and no divisions were sent to Flanders from 15 to 25 August. Foley wrote that the 1st Guard Reserve Division had been included in some accounts but that neither Below or other German sources from the time refer to it; Foley also wrote that Canadian sources mention the 185th Division in interrogation reports.{{sfn|Foley|2016|pp=198\u2013199, 201}} In 2017, Andrew Rawson wrote that the Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders.{{sfn|Rawson|2017|p=120}}\n\n===Casualties===\nAround 22 August, the First Army intelligence department estimated that the Germans had suffered {{nowrap|12,000 to 15,000}} casualties.{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=131}} In the [[History of the Great War]] (1948), the British official historian, [[James Edward Edmonds|James Edmonds]] wrote that from 15 to 23 August, the 1st Canadian Division suffered {{nowrap|3,035 casualties}}, {{nowrap|881 being fatal.}} The Second Canadian Division suffered {{nowrap|2,724 casualties,}} {{nowrap|763 men}} being killed and the 4th Canadian Division had {{nowrap|1,432 casualties,}} including {{nowrap|381 killed.}} Corps troops and other troops attached to the 1st Canadian Division suffered {{nowrap|105 casualties,}} a total of {{nowrap|8,418 casualties,}} {{nowrap|1,389 German}} troops were taken prisoner.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=230}} In the Canadian Official History (1962), [[G.

In the subsequent attacks into Lens, the Canadian Corps suffered another {{nowrap|5,671 casualties}} increasing the number to {{nowrap|9,198 men}} in eleven days.{{sfn|Rawling|1992|p=142}}\n\nIn 2009, Tim Cook wrote that the Canadians suffered {{nowrap|2,000 casualties}} during the preparations for the attack in the first two weeks of August and {{nowrap|9,198 casualties}} from 15 to 25 August, {{nowrap|8,677 at}} Hill 70 and another {{nowrap|521 elsewhere}} on the Western Front. The Canadians had suffered nearly {{nowrap|4,000 of}} their casualties from 21 to 25 August. {{sfn|Cook|2009|p=306}} In ''Capturing Hill 70'' (2016, eds. Douglas Delaney and Serge Durflinger) Delaney wrote that Tim Cook had remedied a mistake in the Canadian official history which gave Canadian Corps casualties for August rather than for the period 15 to 25 August. In 2016, Robert Foley wrote that German casualties were difficult to measure, the German official history (''Der Weltkrieg'') volume noting that complete records did not exist. The 7th Division suffered about {{nowrap|2,000 casualties}} before being withdrawn on 17 August, the 4th Guard Division about {{nowrap|1,200 from}} 15 to 21 August and that the 220th Division also suffered many casualties, Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 losing {{nowrap|474 men}} in four days. Foley estimated that the Germans suffered {{circa|10,000}} casualties; Delaney and Durflinger wrote that the lower estimates of German casualties were higher than those of the attackers, an unusual occurrence in the war.{{sfnm|1a1=Delaney|1y=2016|1pp=4, 27|2a1=Foley|2y=2016|2pp=190\u2013191|3a1=Delaney|3a2=Durflinger|3y=2016|3p=253}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\nFrom the rest of August to the beginning of October the front was relatively quiet, with Canadian efforts devoted mainly to preparations for another offensive, although none took place, largely because the First Army lacked sufficient resources for the task.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=297}} The Canadian Corps was transferred to the Ypres sector in early October in preparation for the [[Second Battle of Passchendaele]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=312}} Soon after the battle, Below was transferred to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], where he took command of the new Austro-German [[14th Army (German Empire)|14th Army]].

The battle took place along the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] on the outskirts of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France between 15 and 25 August 1917.\n\nThe objectives of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the [[3rd Battle of Ypres]] and to make the German hold on Lens untenable.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=125}} The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire, some of which used the new technique of [[predicted fire]], would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the [[Ypres Salient]] but failed to draw in troops from other areas.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=132}}\n\nA later attempt by the Canadian Corps to extend its position into the city of Lens failed but the German and Canadian assessments of the battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective. The battle was costly for both sides and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]], including the new German [[Yellow Cross (chemical warfare)|Yellow Cross]] shell containing the blistering agent [[sulphur mustard]] (mustard gas).\n\n==Background==\n\n===Western front===\n\nBy May 1917, the [[Nivelle Offensive]], despite the successful opening of the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]], had come to a disastrous conclusion with the [[1917 French Army mutinies|French Army mutinies]].{{sfn|Delaney|2016|pp=6\u201310}} On 30 April, as the French hesitated to continue the [[Second Battle of the Aisne]] (16 April \u2013 9 May 1917), the commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], Field Marshal Sir [[Douglas Haig]], gave orders to the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] (General [[Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne|Henry Horne]]), to advance towards Lens to gain a line from M\u00e9ricourt to Sallaumines Hill, Lens and Hill 70. Horne already desired to cut off the salient containing Lens, to shorten the front, while unwilling to risk a costly and slow frontal assault into the maze of ruins. The First Army was understrength after the Battle of Arras but after the German [[Operation Alberich]] the withdrawal to the [[Hindenburg Line]] in March, there was some hope that the [[6th Army (German Empire)|6th Army]] (General [[Otto von Below]]) could be manoeuvred out of Lens by gradual advances to capture the higher ground to the south, west and north of the city.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nOn 7 May, Haig informed the British army commanders that the French had terminated the Nivelle Offensive and the strategy of returning to a war of manoeuvre. Operations to exhaust the powers of resistance of the German armies would resume by systematic surprise attacks  and when this was complete, the British would begin an offensive at Ypres to capture the Belgian coast and reach the frontier with the Netherlands.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80\u201381}} The objectives of the First Army were unchanged but instead of capturing ground around Lens to shorten the front, the intention was to menace the German hold on Lens and the defences south of Lille, to distract, divert and weaken the defenders. The operations were not a diversion but a means to keep the First Army front active for as long as possible, to mislead the Germans as to British intentions in Flanders.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80\u201381}} On 8 May, Horne told the corps commanders that\n\n{{quote|The ruling principles in the conduct of these operations will be careful selection of important objectives of a limited nature, deliberate preparation of the attack, concentration or artillery and economy of infantry, combined in each case with feint attacks and smoke and gas on other positions of the front.|First Army GS 651, 8 May 1917{{sfn|Humphries|2016|p=81}}}}\n\n===Lens===\n[[File:An Impression of Lens, France, Seen from an Aeroplane- the Anglo-german Front Line, 1918 Art.IWMART2661.jpg|thumb|{{centre|\"An Impression of Lens, France, Seen from an Aeroplane, the Anglo-German Front Line, 1918\" ([[Richard Carline]] Art.IWMART2661)}}]]\nFrom Vimy Ridge the ground declines about {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} into the Douai Plain; the valley of the Souchez river is about {{convert|20|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and flows south-west to north-east through the south of the city of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]. In 1914, the river had several road and rail bridges. By 1917, much of the city was derelict due to years of artillery bombardments, the ruins being natural strongpoints overlooked by {{lang|fr|crassiers}} (slag heaps) and several hills, including Hill 70, Hill 65 and Sallaumines Hill. The city is in a shallow, saucer-shaped depression surrounded by the {{lang|fr|crassiers}} and hills. To the south-east, on terrain that is {{convert|25|to|45|m|ft|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} above sea level, Sallaumines Hill rises to {{convert|55|m|ft|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. On the west side of Lens is Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill) north of the Souchez, which is steep-sided and gives a fine view of the city.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nTo the north-west, on the east side of the Lens\u2013Bethune road is a hill about {{convert|70|m|ft|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} high with the suburb of Cit\u00e9 St Pierre on top. Hill 70 is north of the city and has a flat top, giving a fine view of the city and the ground to the north and east. The hill slopes gently towards Lens and there is a shallow depression between it and Cit\u00e9 St Pierre. The slopes of Hill 70 towards Cit\u00e9 St Auguste are steeper.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=79\u201380}} Lens, Hill 70, Sallaumines and Sallaumines Hill to the south-east and their commanding views over the area and the city, fell under German control in October 1914, during the [[Race to the Sea]].{{sfn|Burg|Purcell|2004|p=29}} In September 1915, the British overran the hill during the [[Battle of Loos]] but it was recaptured by the Germans.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=171}}\n\n===Local operations===\n\nHorne began to make plans for the capture of Lens during the [[Battle of Arras (1917)#Third Battle of the Scarpe (3\u20134 May 1917)|Third Battle of the Scarpe]] (3\u20134 May). Horne wanted the Canadian Corps to continue its operations east of [[Vimy Ridge]] to capture M\u00e9ricourt and La Coulotte, which would endanger the German defences of Sallaumines Hill, south-east of Lens, as [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Arthur Holland (British Army officer)|Arthur Holland]]) north of the Souchez, with twelve tanks, captured Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill) and Hill 70. The attacks would envelop Lens on three sides and give [[Artillery observer|forward observation officers]] (FOO) sight of the German defences in the city, potentially to force the 6th Army to retire without the need for a frontal attack. In May, Holland had surveyed the I Corps front, noted that the tactical value of Hill 70 and that it would be inevitable that the Germans would make great efforts to re-capture the hill. German counter-attacks could only be resisted if plenty of reserves and much artillery support were made available. Deliberate attacks to capture the high ground around Lens would meet the goals of the First Army despite its limited means.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=80, 82}} In May and early June, First Army units conducted eighteen raids and minor actions, moving the front line slowly eastwards over the Douai Plain. By 6 June, the First Army had captured all the high ground in the area, except that around Lens. I Corps was west of the city from the Souchez north to Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill), through {{lang|fr|Cit\u00e9 St Theodore}} and along the ridge of the 70-metre hill to the north of Cit\u00e9 St Pierre.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=82}}\n\nOn 9 June, the commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant-General [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]] was promoted and assumed command the [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]]. [[Arthur Currie]], the [[1st Canadian Division]] commander, was promoted in his place.{{sfn|Granatstein|2004|pp=118\u2013119}} On 10 June, Holland told Horne that only the capture of Hill 70 was important and suggested inflicting mass casualties by raids, bombardments and gas attacks, to create the impression that a big attack was imminent. The defenders would be subjected to anxiety and have to move more troops and artillery to the hill, despite the inevitable losses. Horne doubted that the army had sufficient men and artillery for the task and arranged for the [[46th (North Midland) Division]], on the right of I Corps, to make preparations to take Hill 70 and the vicinity but only if reinforcements from GHQ were forthcoming. While waiting, I Corps would capture Hill 65 and south of the Souchez, XIII Corps and the right hand divisions of the Canadian Corps would prepare to attack from Gavrelle to Oppy, Fresnoy, Acheville and M\u0117ricourt, digging jumping-off trenches to simulate a threat to Lens from the south. The real attack was to come from the left flank of the Canadian Corps towards Sallaumines Hill and the east end of Avion. Success would trap the Germans in Lens between Sallaumines Hill to the south and Hill 70 to the north. If the 6th Army did not retire, the preparations by I Corps at Hill 70 would make it impossible to predict from which direction the next attack would come.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|p=83}}\n\n====Affairs south of the Souchez====\n{{see also|Capture of Oppy Wood}}\n\n[[File:Deule.png|thumb|{{centre|Diagram of the Souchez River and associated canal system}}]]\nTo create a threat to Lens, Horne intended that XIII Corps on the southern flank would attack to reach better positions between the villages of Gavrelle and Oppy by advancing the front line for {{convert|200|to|500|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} on a {{convert|2300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} front. The [[4th Canadian Division]] on the left flank of the Canadian Corps south of the [[Souchez]] River (a tributary of the [[De\u00fble]]) and the 46th (North Midland) Division on the right of I Corps, north of the river, were to attack on a front of {{convert|4800|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} to eliminate a German salient from [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]] to the west end of Lens and to occupy Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill). I Corps was to plan for an attack on Hill 70 with the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]] on the left (northern) flank. Horne expected that the operations would take place in early July but found that many of the best heavy guns were to be sent to Flanders and brought forward the date to 28 June. The plans were made less ambitious; the XIII Corps scheme was retained but the attack either side of the Souchez was reduced to the capture the German front line west of Avion and Hill 65; the Hill 70 plan was postponed.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n28 June was dull, humid and storm clouds appeared in the south over the afternoon. The First Army artillery, assisted by Third Army guns en route to Flanders, began a bombardment along the {{convert|14|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} army front from [[Gavrelle]] to [[Hulluch]]. The simulation of a much bigger attack on Lens was enhanced by lightning, thunder and a downpour, which began at {{nowrap|7:10 p.m.}} when the infantry advance began. The adjacent brigades of the 31st and 5th divisions had been bombarded in their jumping-off trenches at {{nowrap|5:30 p.m.}} and suffered 200 casualties before the advance began. The survivors moved so fast that when a German counter-barrage fell on no man's land three minutes later, the British were on the far side and unharmed. The attackers suffered few casualties, took {{nowrap|200 prisoners}} and counted {{nowrap|280 dead}} German soldiers. Gavrelle Mill and a new line was consolidated, despite the rainstorm, from which the areas to the north-east and east around [[Neuvireuil]] and [[Fresnes-l\u00e8s-Montauban|Fresnes]] could be observed, along with Greenland Hill to the south-west.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n====Capture of Avion====\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62771.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Avion, Sallaumines and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62065)}}]]\nOrders from the First Army HQ reached Currie on 12 June, who replied with a suggestion that the capture of Hill 65 was tactically desirable to gain observation over Lens and to deprive the Germans of reciprocal observation of the British rear. The capture of Avion could be replaced by a raid, to avoid the casualties of a permanent occupation. Preparations for offensive operations towards Avion would be more meaningful to German observers than the attack which followed. The suggested alternative was not well received by Major-general W. H. Anderson, the First Army chief of staff, because one purpose of the operation was to threaten Lille, which could only occur with the capture of Lens, after the attack on Avion. The Canadian operation was only a stage in the plan, to be followed by an attack or decoy towards Sallaumines Hill. A few days later more artillery was transferred to Flanders, which led to the postponement of the Hill 70 attack.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nFurther north, opposite the 4th Canadian and 46th (North Midland) divisions, the German [[56th Infantry Division (German Empire)|56th Division]] had on 22 June, moved into reserve to substitute for a division transferred to Flanders. The division holding the line had orders to retire from the salient to the Avion\u2013Lens railway if pressed. The western slopes of Hill 65 had been occupied on 24 June after a German retirement and patrols pushed forward towards Avion Trench, which was taken early on 28 June. The divisions made ready to resume the advance when the army barrage began at {{nowrap|7:10 p.m.}} Most of Avion, [[\u00c9leu-dit-Leauwette]] and the eastern slope of Hill 65 was captured, as the [[3rd Canadian Division]] formed a defensive flank along the [[Arleux]]\u2013Avion road, joining with the 4th Canadian Division in Avion. Rain and the flooding from the Souchez stopped patrols from probing the German main line of resistance in the north-eastern part of Avion and along a railway embankment about {{nowrap|600|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} further on.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===First Army===\n[[File:Lens-Position.png|thumb|Location of Lens]]\nThe Canadian Corps (Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie) had the 1st, 2nd and 4th Canadian divisions for the attack and the 3rd Canadian Division in reserve. Artillery planning was delegated to Major [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] who had 240 [[QF 18-pounder gun|18-pounder]] field guns and 78 [[QF 4.5-inch howitzer|4.5-inch]] howitzers of the Canadian Corps field artillery, 31 of the 18-pounders being unusable due to barrel-wear. I Corps contributed twelve more 18-pounders and XIII Corps eighteen. Brooke also had 38 batteries of heavy siege howitzers consisting of twenty [[BL 9.2-inch howitzer|9.2-inch howitzers]], twenty [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI \u2013 VIII|8-inch howitzers]], eighty [[BL 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer|6-inch howitzers]], 42 [[BL 60-pounder gun|60-pounder guns]] and two [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|6-inch guns]]. The British contributed 28 batteries but approximately 25 per cent of the heavy artillery for the operation was of dubious value due to barrel wear. Twenty batteries were in three Heavy Artillery Groups (HAGs) for destructive bombardment, and 18 batteries in three HAGs for counter-battery-fire, four British and two Canadian.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=108\u2013109}}{{efn|From 1916, siege batteries were affiliated temporarily to a HAG and HAGs were sent to corps as necessary.{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=109}}}}\n\n===6th Army===\nThe 6th Army was responsible for the defence of the area between Lille and Cambrai, Lens being about halfway between. The town was an important railway junction and after the Battle of Arras, earlier in 1917, had become a salient in the German defences. Hill 70 and the vicinity was held by the [[7th Division (German Empire)|7th Division]], part of {{lang|de|Gruppe Loos}}, the headquarters of [[IV Corps (German Empire)|IV Corps]]. (The German army had begun to use corps headquarters as territorial command units, rather than of a permanent complement of divisions, during the Battle of the Somme.){{sfn|Edmonds|1991|loc=p. 226 (footnote)}} Lens was garrisoned by the [[11th Reserve Division (German Empire)|11th Reserve Division]] in {{lang|de|Gruppe Souchez}} ([[VI Corps (German Empire)|VI Corps]]). In anticipation of an attack, Army Group Crown prince Rupprecht had moved the [[4th Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|4th Guard Division]] and the [[220th Infantry Division (German Empire)|220th Division]] into the 6th Army area in reserve. The divisions in reserve rehearsed reinforcement and counter-attacks with the two front divisions, Below having written of an expected Canadian ({{lang|de|Angriffstruppe}}) attack on 15 July.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=188}}{{efn|Adjacent units provided supporting artillery fire and the [[49th Reserve Division (German Empire)|49th Reserve Division]], [[39th Division (German Empire)|39th Division]] and the [[240th Division (German Empire)|240th Division]] moved into reserve at times between 20 and 25 August.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=197}} Tim Cook wrote that the [[185th Infantry Division (German Empire)|185th Division]] also participated in the battle.{{sfn|Cook|2009|p=287}}}}\n\n===Plan===\nOn 7 July, due to a lack of artillery, Currie was ordered to take over more of the line to the north and to attack the objectives west of Lens not taken by the 46th (North Midland) Division from 29 June and 2 July. In the south the Canadian Corps was to attack beyond Avion to a railway embankment, ready to advance to Sallaumines Hill. Soon afterwards, GHQ announced that more artillery would be forthcoming and Horne met the corps commanders again on 10 July; Currie wanted to make the main effort north of the Souchez, the Canadian Corps taking responsibility for the front from Avion to Hill 70. Horne agreed and on 11 July, Currie issued the first orders for the attack. The Canadian plan for 30 July used the I Corps plan for the abortive June attack as a basis; the scheduled attack to the embankment east of Avion was to go ahead, to obtain a good jumping off point for a later advance on Sallaumines Hill to mislead the defenders about preparations for an attack. From 11 to 19 July, Canadian Corps intelligence discovered that German dispositions had changed. A new third defensive line had been completed along the northern outskirts of the city, from Cinnabar Trench along Nun's Alley, Norman Trench, Hugo Trench to Bois Hugo, beyond the objectives given to Currie on 10 July. The position had three thick belts of barbed wire, a light railway for supply and eleven strongpoints with fields of fire into Commotion Trench, the final Canadian objective. The new position was judged to have become the main German defence line.{{sfn|Humphries|2016|pp=87\u201389}}\n\nHill 70 overlooked Lens and the Douai plain and Currie believed that the Germans would commit troops that they could ill-afford to lose, to regain a position that they dared not leave in Canadian possession. Artillery observers on the hill could defeat German counter-attacks with accurate artillery-fire.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=285}} The hill was to be occupied quickly and strongpoint defensive positions were to be established around the {{nowrap|48 [[Vickers machine gun]]s}} allocated to each brigade. A combination of small-arms and artillery firepower would defeat German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=1992|1pp=74\u201375|2a1=Walthert|2y=2015|2p=23}} The 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions were to attack on a front of {{convert|4000|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} to a depth of {{convert|1500|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} and capture the main enemy defensive positions on the eastern (reverse) slope of Hill 70. In the first stage, the first objective of the attackers was the German front-line, the second objective (blue line) was the German second position on the crest of the hill and the third objective (green line) was the German third line, on the far slope, about {{convert|1500|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} from the start line. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division would attack north of Hill 70 and its 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade would attack the summit.{{sfn|Bell|1992|p=75}} The 4th and 5th Canadian Infantry Brigades of the 2nd Canadian Division would attack the ruins of suburbs {{lang|fr|Cit\u00e9 St \u00c9douard}}, {{lang|fr|St Laurent}} and {{lang|fr|St \u00c9mile}} directly south of the hill.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\nBy 16 July, the 1st Canadian Division infantry had transferred from the south-west of Lens to the north-western fringe of Hill 70. On 22 July, the divisional artillery arrived and by 25 July was in position from the south of Li\u00e9vin to [[Grenay, Pas-de-Calais|Bully-Grenay]], among mine workings, slag heaps and ruined villages, many next to light rail lines, the Canadians having inherited the preliminary work done by I Corps. Wire-cutting had been going on since 11 July but there was no time for the fifteen-day preliminary bombardment laid down in the artillery plan of 11 July. On 26 July the last orders were issued and a document \"Canadian Corps Scheme of Operations\" by the [[Brigadier-General]], [[General Staff]] (BGGS), Percy Radcliffe set 30 July as the date of the attack, to coincide with the Flanders Offensive. Heavy rains reduced the area to a swamp, grounded the RFC, which provided information on the progress of the bombardment, some guns were late arriving and others had too many defects to use for wire-cutting. The attack was postponed and despite the mediocre state of many of the guns, the bombardment continued into August and several creeping barrages were fired to provoke German counter-barrages and reveal German gun positions. The 15th, 50th and 2nd Canadian Heavy Artillery Group bombarded German gun positions revealed by aerial photographs, [[flash spotting]] and [[Artillery sound ranging|sound ranging]], neutralisation being more effective than destruction.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\n====Artillery====\nFor the {{nowrap|attack, 204}} eighteen-pounders and forty-eight {{nowrap|4.5-inch howitzers}} were to fire a creeping barrage; the 1st Canadian Division front {{nowrap|had 72}} eighteen-pounders from the 1st and 3rd Canadian divisional artilleries and thirty field guns from the British, {{nowrap|18 from}} the 14th Army Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA), six from the 53rd Battery and six from the 112th Battery. The 2nd Canadian Division had its {{nowrap|36 divisional}} eighteen-pounders and another {{nowrap|76 British}} {{nowrap|guns, 36}} eighteen-pounders of the 46th (North Midland) divisional artillery, twelve 18-pounders of the 179th Army Field Brigade and another {{nowrap|18 from}} the 120th, 165th and 317th batteries. All of the 4.5-inch howitzers were from the 2nd Canadian divisional artillery, making sixty Canadian and {{nowrap|76 British}} guns. The attack had {{nowrap|318 field}} guns and howitzers, with {{nowrap|164 siege}} guns and howitzers, with {{nowrap|300,000 18-pounder}} shells, {{nowrap|150,000 4.5-inch}} and more than {{nowrap|250,000 heavy}} artillery rounds. The Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery HQ had the 63rd, 64th Heavy Artillery Groups HAG) with eight siege batteries each and the Canadian Heavy Artillery Group with five, for wire-cutting and trench destruction. Barrel wear and general unreliability meant that about half of the 18-pounders could not be used in the preliminary bombardment. {{nowrap|About 165}} eighteen-pounders were to fire the first layer of the creeping barrage, with the infantry advancing about {{cvt|75|yd|m|0}} behind. To make it harder for the German artillery to bombard the infantry by following the creeping barrage, the rest of the 18-pounders and some 4.5-inch howitzers were to fire a barrage {{cvt|200|yd|m|0}} further forward; 6-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers were to fire {{cvt|100|to|200|yd|m|0}} beyond the second barrage line.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nThe 15th, 50th and 2nd Canadian Heavy Artillery Group had {{nowrap|111 artillery}} pieces, from 60-pounder guns to 9.2-inch howitzers and four super heavy [[BL 12-inch Mk X naval gun|12-inch gun]] and one [[BL 15-inch howitzer|15-inch howitzer]]. The 12-inch guns had the ammunition for eighty rounds-per-day-per-gun for fifteen days. High explosive, gas and shrapnel shells were to be fired at German gun positions revealed by RFC reconnaissance photographs and the flash-spotters and sound rangers, to kill gunners and supply horses. One report had the 6th Army artillery in nine groups of {{nowrap|70\u201380 guns,}} half of them field guns and half of them heavy. On the eve of the attack, the counter-batteries claimed that forty of 102 German guns had been knocked out. Many of the field guns were beyond the range of Hill 70 but I Corps on the northern (left) flank and XIII Corps on the southern (right) flank were to induce German guns to reply to harassing fire. The counter-batteries were also to be used to destroy German counter-attacks and soon after zero hour, guns from the bombardment HAGs were to join in with the counter-battery HAGs against German infantry counter-attacks. Forward Observation Observers were to accompany the Canadian infantry and establish observation posts connected to the rear with telephones, wireless and visual signalling equipment to direct the artillery.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n====Gas====\nBy 1917, gas was delivered by shell, the substances being classed as lethal, harassing and persistent; lethal types were chlorine, phosgene and diphosgene, the phosgene types having little colour or smell. Harassing gases were non-lethal and included tear gas to compel the opponents to wear their gas masks. Catching troops not wearing gas masks with a lethal concentration of gas was difficult but phosgene bombardments could cause casualties, slow the completion of tasks and tire the victims. The Canadians collected {{nowrap|15,000}} 4.5-inch and 60-pounder gas shells for the operation. Before the attack, the Royal Engineers bombarded the German defences with {{nowrap|3,500 drums}} ({{cvt|46|LT|t|0}}) of gas fired from [[Livens Projector]]s. Two prisoners of Infantry Regiment 156 said that their companies of eighty men and 56 men had suffered twenty and 29 gas casualties. A prisoner from Infantry Regiment 22 said that two companies had suffered 90 gas casualties.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\n====Machine-guns====\n\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|alt=Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917|{{centre|Example of a Vickers gun in action}}]]\nSixteen companies from the Canadian Machine Gun Corps with 128 Vickers machine guns and the armoured cars of the Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade (CMMGB) with 32 guns, under the command of the divisions were to supplement the artillery by firing a barrage over the heads of the Canadian infantry. The harassing machine-gun fire was to impede the movement of German troops and supplies, with targets engaged by at least four guns. The Vickers guns were supplied with 20,000 bullets per gun per day, to fire day and night, to make it more difficult for German troops to repair their defences and put out more barbed wire. The cars of the CMMGB drove back and forth behind Canadian lines and from mid-July to early August fired {{nowrap|2,694,700 rounds;}} including the static guns about ten million rounds were fired before the Canadian attack. When the hill was captured, {{nowrap|48 Vickers}} guns were to be dug in, one for every {{cvt|35|yd|m|0}} of front, guarded but several infantry sections.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n====Royal Flying Corps====\n\n{{main|Royal Flying Corps}}\n\nThe Canadian Corps had [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|16 Squadron]] ([[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|BE2cs]]), [[No. 40 Squadron RAF|40 Squadron]] ([[Nieuport 17]]s) and [[No. 43 Squadron RAF|43 Squadron]] ([[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter]]s)<!--a proper name not a fraction--> RFC in support and the Sopwith Camels of [[No. 208 Squadron RAF|8 (Naval) Squadron]], [[Royal Naval Air Service]] for high patrols over the battlefield. An advanced landing ground at Petit Sains was made ready for 43 Squadron Strutters to mount continuous, counter-attack reconnaissance patrols. Formations of three Strutters were to observe an area {{convert|7000|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1,500|to|2500|yd|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} deep, that counter-attacking German troops would have to traverse. The Strutter crews were to report their observations by wireless to the Canadian Corps and Heavy Artillery Group headquarters, then attack with their machine-guns any German artillery or concentrations of troops seen at bottlenecks. Contact patrols to mark the progress of the Canadian infantry were to be flown by the B.E.2c crews of 16 Squadron.{{sfnm|1a1=Wise|1y=1981|1p=422|2a1=Edmonds|2y=1991|2p=221}}\n\nOn 9 August, six 40 Squadron Nieuport 17s made a low-level attack on the six German observation balloons along the Hill 70\u2013Lens front and shot them down. German artillery observation was obstructed but the attack made the Canadian interest in the area obvious. For the two days and nights before the attack, [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|10 Squadron]], [[No. 25 Squadron RAF|25 Squadron]] ([[Airco DH.4|DH.4]]) and [[No. 27 Squadron RAF|27 Squadron]] ([[Martinsyde G.100|Martinsyde Elephant]]) bombed railway junctions, airfields and billets. In earlier battles, British fighters patrolling at height to engage German fighters had not been able to see low-flying, camouflaged German aircraft, which flew artillery-observation and ground attack sorties without interference. Six Nieuport 17s of 40 Squadron moved to an advanced landing ground at [[Mazingarbe]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the front and a ground station was established on the heights west of Loos. When observers spotted a German aircraft at low altitude, a wireless message was sent to Mazingarbe for a Nieuport 17 to be sent up to engage the German aircraft. A letter-code on white canvas sheets containing the location of German aircraft could be laid on the ground for an airborne fighter pilot to read.{{sfn|Wise|1981|p=422}}\n\n====Deception operations====\n[[File:Hill 70 - Map of harassing fire.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Artillery map of the Lens area, marking locations to bombard with harassing fire.}}]]\nBy 16 July, the Canadian Corps had redeployed for the attack on Hill 70; the 1st Canadian Division had taken over from I Corps to the north-west of the hill, and the Canadian Corps occupied a line from the Souchez River northwards to just beyond Hill 70. To deceive the Germans about the place and size of the attack and to disguise Canadian preparations, the XIII, Canadian, I and XI, corps began to conduct larger raids in battalion strength, on most nights from the middle of July, along with gas discharges along the front. Towards the end of the month, raids and bombardments on the army front increased, XI Corps to the north raided nightly, I Corps conducted destructive and wire-cutting bombardments at night and bombarded the German front with machine-guns and mortars during the day; XIII Corps conducted similar operations on the right (southern) army flank.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1962|1p=285|2a1=Gardner|2y=2016|2pp=39\u201340}}\n\nIn late July, the 9th Canadian Brigade feinted a direct attack of Lens by engaging units of the German [[36th Reserve Division (German Empire)|36th Reserve Division]] at M\u00e9ricourt Trench.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1962|1p=285|2a1=Farr|2y=2007|2p=171|3a1=Walthert|3y=2015|3p=23}} Bad weather led to the attack on Hill 70 being postponed from late July until mid-August. In the interim, special companies of the [[Royal Engineers]] augmented the regular level of bombardment by firing {{nowrap|3,500 gas}} drums from Livens projectors and {{nowrap|900 gas}} shells into Lens by 15 August. The artillery neutralized {{nowrap|40 out}} of an estimated {{nowrap|102 German}} batteries in the area by zero hour, partly using the technique of [[predicted fire]] using datum points and calibrated guns for the first time, which greatly improved the accuracy of the artillery.{{sfn|Farndale|1986|p=205}} Troops were rotated through the reserve area to conduct training and rehearsals in preparation for the assault.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=286}} On the northern (left) flank, the 46th (North Midland) Division made a diversionary attack north of the hill, with [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] discharges, artillery bombardments and the preparation of dummy tanks and troops on the two nights before the attack to be exposed to view at zero hour.{{sfn|Gardner|2016|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n==Battle==\n===15 August===\n\n[[File:Hill 70 - Water tanks in ruined house.jpg|thumb|left|upright|{{centre|A ruined house west of Lens, used to shelter water tanks.}}]]\nDuring the night of {{nowrap|14/15 August}} the Canadian infantry assembled in their jumping-off points; harassing fire from German artillery continued but with no particular intensity.{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=118}} The Germans had moved up reserves on the previous night in anticipation of an attack and the main assembly of Canadian troops was detected by {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}}{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=287\u2013289}} At {{nowrap|4:25 a.m.}} the Canadian creeping barrage began and the infantry advanced, some troops having left their trenches early to avoid the German counter-barrage expected as soon as the attack began. At {{nowrap|4:26 a.m.}} Special Companies RE fired {{nowrap|400 drums}} of oil from Livens projectors, which dropped into the German defences in Cit\u00e9 St \u00c9lisabeth, creating a smoke-screen and began an hour-long smoke bombardment from 4-inch Stokes mortars.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=118\u2013119}} Artillery Forward Observation Officers moved forward with the infantry and artillery-observation aircraft flew overhead sending {{nowrap|240 calls}} for artillery fire by wireless that day.{{sfn|Farndale|1986|p=205}}{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=287\u2013289}}\n\nIn the 1st Canadian Division area, 4 Special Company RE fired mortars and Livens projectors against the left flank of the attack, as a deception and to shield the attack front from observers on higher ground several miles to the north.

Vickers gunners fired a machine-gun barrage at maximum range then gradually fired shorter towards the German positions. The Canadian infantry reached the blue line, {{cvt|600|yd|m|0}} forward in twenty minutes and paused to dig in. The advance began again and reached the final objective (red line) at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} German resistance was determined and the Canadians used Lewis guns to pin down the German infantry as rifle- and bombing-sections attacked from a flank. On the southern (right) flank, the 4th Canadian Division diversion succeeded and with fewer guns in support, the German artillery reply was more effective than further north. The 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade anticipated the German artillery bombardment and the Canadians took cover in deep shelters in the edge of Lens, the brigade suffering fewer than 24 casualties during the first day.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=119\u2013121}}\n\nThe four attacking Canadian brigades began to consolidate as soon as they reached their objectives and each brigade emplaced 48 Vickers guns in its section of the blue line. Connexions to the artillery were established by observers with field telephones, wireless and signal lamps and the artillery changed from bombardment and creeping barrage fire to be ready to fire SOS barrages against German counter-attacks. At about {{nowrap|8:15 a.m.}} the 4th Guard Division began the first German attack, having been seen assembling in Cit\u00e9 St Auguste. The Germans had to move over about {{cvt|0.75|mi|km|0}} of open ground and the Canadian gun-, machine-gun- and rifle-fire covered the ground with corpses and wounded. An attack at {{nowrap|12:45 p.m.}} met the same fate, the few Germans reaching the Canadians being bombed out. German counter-attacks continued and the German artillery still in action tried to support the attacks and shell the Canadian defences. A counter-attack at {{nowrap|1:15 p.m.}} was prepared by German heavy artillery, which cut many of the field telephone links to the Canadian artillery but some remained operational and several runners got through with messages. The 2nd Canadian Division artillery received the message \"Please turn Artillery on.\" and did, repulsing the attack; the Canadian gunners did the same to another German attempt at {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} Canadian machine-gunners fired all day, seven guns of the 3rd Canadian Machine Gun Company firing {{nowrap|5,000 rounds}} in a few minutes.{{sfn|Cook|2016|pp=121\u2013122}}{{efn|The 3rd Canadian Machine Gun Company fired {{nowrap|271,000 rounds}} during the battle and the 8th Canadian Machine Gun {{nowrap|Company 360,000.}}{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=122}}}}\n\n===Air operations===\nThe Sopwith&nbsp;{{frac|1|1|2}}&nbsp;Strutters of 43 Squadron received many hits from ground fire but only two were shot down, three crew being wounded; a German aircraft was shot down and others driven off but four more Sopwith&nbsp;{{frac|1|1|2}}&nbsp;Strutters were too badly damaged to be serviceable for 16 August.

The crews called on the Canadian heavy artillery and then attacked with their machine-guns, which \"all but annihilated\" the German force.{{sfn|Wise|1981|pp=422\u2013423}} From 15 to 17 August, the RFC sent {{nowrap|240 reports}} of German artillery in action and all were answered by the counter-battery groups.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=221}}\n\n===Counter-attacks===\nTo prepare for German counter-attacks, the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions began to reverse captured trenches and construct strong points immediately after capturing the blue line. Within two hours of the start of the battle, the Germans began using their immediate reserves to mount local counter-attacks ({{lang|de|Gegensto\u00dfe}}). Between {{nowrap|7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.}} on the morning of 15 August, the Germans executed four local attacks against Canadian positions. Each attack was repulsed due in large part to the work of forward artillery observers, who could now overlook some of the German positions. On one occasion, a German counter-attack was only repulsed after engaging in hand-to-hand fighting. The Germans rapidly brought up seven additional battalions from the 4th Guards Division and 185th Division to reinforce the eight line battalions. Over the following three days, the Germans counter-attacked 21 times against Canadian positions.{{sfn|Cook|2000|pp=129, 131}} A frontal attack against the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade on the afternoon of 15 August ultimately failed. A German attack against the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade re-captured Chicory Trench but the German infantry were expelled later that afternoon.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=289\u2013290}}\n\n===16\u201317 August===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R22888, Westfront, Flammenwerfer.jpg|thumb|right|{{centre|German [[flamethrower]] teams temporarily breached the Canadian line.}}]]\nThe morning of 16 August was relatively quiet, with only a few attempts made by small German parties to approach the Canadian lines. After having failed to capture all their objectives the previous day and after several postponements, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade relieved the two attacking battalions with the 5th and 10th Canadian battalions, which attacked by short dashes for {{cvt|400|yd|m|0}} down the bare slope and captured the remainder of the final objective. The attack was costly as the Germans opposite were preparing their own counter-attack and hand-to-hand fighting took place at the chalk quarry, which cost the Germans 100 fatal casualties, 100 wounded and thirty prisoners. The Germans began to counter-attack at {{nowrap|7:15 p.m.}} after a delay but good observation enabled the attacks to be repulsed by massed artillery-fire, machine-gun fire and the fire of the Canadian infantry. To the south, the 5th Canadian Battalion retired about {{cvt|200|yd|m|0}} from the final objective to shell-holes, after suffering many casualties and running short of ammunition.The brigade suffered {{nowrap|249 men}} killed, {{nowrap|1,177 men}} wounded and {{nowrap|225 men}} missing.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholson|1y=1962|1pp=290\u2013291|2a1=Edmonds|2y=1991|2p=227}}\n\nAttempts by the 4th and 11th Canadian Infantry Brigades to eliminate a German salient between Cit\u00e9 St \u00c9lisabeth and Lens on 17 August failed and as had been foreseen, the Germans continued to mount determined counter-attacks. The German commanders realized that the Canadian and British artillery would need to be neutralized before a counter-attack could succeed. The Germans began a series of counter-attacks against a chalk quarry under Canadian control outside Cit\u00e9 St. Auguste and tried to mislead the Canadian artillery by sending up false flare signals or provoking the infantry to call for unnecessary artillery fire.{{sfn|Cook|2000|p=130}} The Germans stopped wave attacks and counter-attacked with dispersed groups of troops trickling forward using cover; some managed to reach the Canadian defences and fight hand-to-hand.{{sfn|Cook|2009|p=289}} The Germans began to use poison gas in earnest and from 15,000 to 20,000 of the new [[Yellow Cross (chemical warfare)|Yellow Cross]] shells, containing the blistering agent [[sulphur mustard]], were fired in addition to [[diphosgene|Green Cross]] (diphosgene) shells. The positions of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Artillery Field Brigades and the Canadian front line were gassed. The 1st Canadian Division artillery suffered 183 casualties and three batteries suffered direct hits. Many gunners became casualties after gas fogged the goggles of their respirators and they were forced to remove them to set fuses, lay their sights and maintain accurate fire.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=1991|1p=228|2a1=Cook|2y=2000|2p=130}}\n\n===17/18 August===\nOn the night of {{nowrap|17/18 August,}} German troops made several attempts to recapture the chalk quarry and Chicory Trench under the cover of gas. All attempts against the chalk quarry failed and only one company of the Reserve Infantry Regiment 55 (on loan to the 11th Reserve Division) managed to breach the Canadian defences at Chicory Trench before being repulsed. German troops employing [[flamethrowers]] managed to penetrate the Canadian line north of the quarry on the morning of 18 August before being driven out.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=291\u2013292}}\n\n===19\u201320 August===\n\n[[File:David Milne - Loos from the Trenches on Hill 70.jpg|thumb|{{centre|[[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]] - Loos from the Trenches on Hill 70.}}]]\nThe front quietened significantly after the final counter-attack against the chalk quarry. For the Canadian Corps, the following two days consisted largely of consolidation. The front line was drawn back {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, midway between the original intermediate and final objectives. The 4th Canadian Division slightly advanced its forward posts on the outskirts of Lens and extended its front northward to include the Lens\u2013B\u00e9thune road. Currie wished to further improve the position around Hill 70 and ordered an attack against German positions along a {{convert|3000|yd|mi+km|abbr=on}} front, opposite the 2nd and 4th Canadian Divisions.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=293}}\n\n===21\u201322 August (Attack on Lens)===\nThe operation was scheduled for the morning of 21 August, the tasks being divided between the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade on the left and the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade on the right. The attack was to begin at {{nowrap|4:35 a.m.}} but the Germans began shelling the Canadian positions at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} Just before the Canadian attack, the left flank of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade was attacked by units of the 4th Guard Division and a battalion of the 220th Division. The forces met between their objectives and fought hand-to-hand and with the bayonet; in the ''m\u00e9l\u00e9e'' the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade advance was stopped and the troops forced back to their start line. Communication between the forward units and brigade headquarters had broken down at the beginning of the attack and could not be restored due to the German bombardment, making it all but impossible to co-ordinate the infantry and artillery.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=293\u2013295}}\n\nOn the right flank, a unit of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered a large number of casualties to the German artillery while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire, near its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives late in the evening, creating a salient in the 4th Canadian Division line. On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful and an attack on 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking the Green Crassier slag heap and the mine complex at Fosse St Louis. The attack was repulsed, most of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Arthur Ambrose McEvoy - Official Portrait of Filip Konowal.jpg|thumb|upright|{{centre|Corporal Filip Konowal, the only Ukrainian Victoria Cross recipient.}}]]\nOn 15 August, Haig made a diary note that the attack had gone \"very well\"; Horne called it \"an unqualified success\", despite the failure of the 6th Army to retreat and began to plan an attack on Sallaumines Hill for early September.{{sfn|Gardner|2016|p=44}} In 1942, the writers of {{lang|de|Der Weltkrieg}}, the German official history (volume XIII), wrote that since mid-July, the German defences at Lens and for about {{convert|7|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the north had been under bombardment, which became more intense in August because Haig wanted a diversion from the offensive in Flanders. On 15 August, the Canadian Corps attacked the German positions from Lens to about {{convert|2|km|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} north, took an important height [Hill 70] for observation and pushed beyond the First Position ({{lang|de|I Stellung}}). Counter-attacks recaptured pockets of ground but the Canadians could not be expelled from {{lang|de|I Stellung}}. Fighting continued intermittently until 24 August but did not lead to more significant changes. The Canadians took over {{nowrap|1,100 prisoners}} and in their counter-attacks the Germans over {{nowrap|1,002}} prisoners.{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1942|p=67}}\n\nIn 1981, Sydney Wise, author of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] official history, called the attack at Hill 70 \"a demonstration of how a set-piece attack should be carried out\".{{sfn|Wise|1981|p=423}} The Germans refrained from attempts to recapture the lost ground at Lens, due to the need to avoid  diverting resources from the Third Battle of Ypres in Flanders, the main strategic effort on the Western Front by both sides.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=329}} In 2009, Tim Cook wrote that the Canadian attack had crushed the defenders by 18 August, 21 German counter-attacks being repulsed. The Canadian plan had succeeded but had depended on the determination of the Canadian infantry against equally determined opponents, who suffered approximately {{nowrap|20,000 casualties,}} against {{nowrap|5,600 Canadian.}} The attack ended on 25 August and was a considerable victory despite the Germans retaining their hold on occupation of Lens. Two German divisions intended for Flanders had been diverted to Hill 70 and the reinforcement plan for the fighting at Ypres had been dislocated. Cook called the battle the most one-sided German defeat apart from the Battle of Messines in June. The attacks into Lens had been \"clumsy, hurried affairs\" and that the Canadians suffered nearly {{nowrap|4,000 casualties}} from 21 to 25 August. The frontal attacks on 21 and 23 August were rash and demonstrated that Currie lacked experience; Cook placed blame on Watson and Hilliam, the latter of whom should have been sacked.{{sfn|Cook|2009|pp=295, 306}}\n\nIn 2016, Robert Foley wrote that Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht and the 6th Army headquarters thought that the Canadian advance had been stopped by 16 August. Below wrote in his diary that more than ten attacks by the Canadians, \"the best English (sic) troops\", had been repulsed. The Canadian attack had been stopped because the \"English\" lacked the flexibility to exploit success, a criticism that had emerged during the Battle of the Somme in 1916.{{sfn|Foley|2016|pp=198\u2013199}} The Canadian attack was seen as a feint to divert German divisions from Flanders and the army group ordered the 6th Army to fight with its own resources, including the seven divisions in army reserve. The 4th Guard and the 220th divisions acted as {{lang|de|[[Eingreif division|Eingreifdivisionen]]}} on 15 August and with the existing divisions, conducted most of the German defence. Once the German counter-attack in 15 August had failed, the attempt to recapture Hill 70 was abandoned and counter-attacks were restricted local efforts to repulse Canadian attacks and for tactical improvements to the German defences. Two divisions were moved from reserve to replace the 4th Guard and the 220th divisions, three more divisions in reserve remaining available to the 6th Army. No forces were transferred to Lens from Flanders or anywhere else and no divisions were sent to Flanders from 15 to 25 August. Foley wrote that the 1st Guard Reserve Division had been included in some accounts but that neither Below or other German sources from the time refer to it; Foley also wrote that Canadian sources mention the 185th Division in interrogation reports.{{sfn|Foley|2016|pp=198\u2013199, 201}} In 2017, Andrew Rawson wrote that the Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders.{{sfn|Rawson|2017|p=120}}\n\n===Casualties===\nAround 22 August, the First Army intelligence department estimated that the Germans had suffered {{nowrap|12,000 to 15,000}} casualties.{{sfn|Cook|2016|p=131}} In the [[History of the Great War]] (1948), the British official historian, [[James Edward Edmonds|James Edmonds]] wrote that from 15 to 23 August, the 1st Canadian Division suffered {{nowrap|3,035 casualties}}, {{nowrap|881 being fatal.}} The Second Canadian Division suffered {{nowrap|2,724 casualties,}} {{nowrap|763 men}} being killed and the 4th Canadian Division had {{nowrap|1,432 casualties,}} including {{nowrap|381 killed.}} Corps troops and other troops attached to the 1st Canadian Division suffered {{nowrap|105 casualties,}} a total of {{nowrap|8,418 casualties,}} {{nowrap|1,389 German}} troops were taken prisoner.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=230}} In the Canadian Official History (1962), [[G. W. L. Nicholson]] wrote that the Canadians and attached troops suffered {{nowrap|9,198 casualties.}} In ''Surviving Trench Warfare'' (1992) Bill Rawling wrote that the attack on Hill 70 cost the Canadian Corps {{nowrap|3,527 casualties,}} {{nowrap|1,056 killed,}} {{nowrap|2,432 wounded}} and {{nowrap|39 taken}} prisoner. In the subsequent attacks into Lens, the Canadian Corps suffered another {{nowrap|5,671 casualties}} increasing the number to {{nowrap|9,198 men}} in eleven days.{{sfn|Rawling|1992|p=142}}\n\nIn 2009, Tim Cook wrote that the Canadians suffered {{nowrap|2,000 casualties}} during the preparations for the attack in the first two weeks of August and {{nowrap|9,198 casualties}} from 15 to 25 August, {{nowrap|8,677 at}} Hill 70 and another {{nowrap|521 elsewhere}} on the Western Front. The Canadians had suffered nearly {{nowrap|4,000 of}} their casualties from 21 to 25 August. {{sfn|Cook|2009|p=306}} In ''Capturing Hill 70'' (2016, eds. Douglas Delaney and Serge Durflinger) Delaney wrote that Tim Cook had remedied a mistake in the Canadian official history which gave Canadian Corps casualties for August rather than for the period 15 to 25 August. In 2016, Robert Foley wrote that German casualties were difficult to measure, the German official history (''Der Weltkrieg'') volume noting that complete records did not exist. The 7th Division suffered about {{nowrap|2,000 casualties}} before being withdrawn on 17 August, the 4th Guard Division about {{nowrap|1,200 from}} 15 to 21 August and that the 220th Division also suffered many casualties, Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 losing {{nowrap|474 men}} in four days. Foley estimated that the Germans suffered {{circa|10,000}} casualties; Delaney and Durflinger wrote that the lower estimates of German casualties were higher than those of the attackers, an unusual occurrence in the war.{{sfnm|1a1=Delaney|1y=2016|1pp=4, 27|2a1=Foley|2y=2016|2pp=190\u2013191|3a1=Delaney|3a2=Durflinger|3y=2016|3p=253}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\nFrom the rest of August to the beginning of October the front was relatively quiet, with Canadian efforts devoted mainly to preparations for another offensive, although none took place, largely because the First Army lacked sufficient resources for the task.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=297}} The Canadian Corps was transferred to the Ypres sector in early October in preparation for the [[Second Battle of Passchendaele]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=312}} Soon after the battle, Below was transferred to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], where he took command of the new Austro-German [[14th Army (German Empire)|14th Army]].

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million. Of these, I would suggest that between 6-million and 8-million were ethnic Chinese, regardless of where they were resident.<ref name=sterling/>}}\n\nAccording to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' pp&nbsp;2\u20133</ref> The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher because\u2014under a directive ratified on August 5, 1937, by Emperor [[Hirohito]]\u2014the constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.<ref>Akira Fujiwara, ''Nitch\u00fb Sens\u00f4 ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu'', Kikan Sens\u00f4 Sekinin Kenky\u00fb 9, 1995, p. 22</ref> Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the [[surrender of Japan]].<ref>Tanaka, ibid., Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p. 360</ref> After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491548/Alive-safe-brutal-Japanese-soldiers-butchered-20-000-Allied-seamen-cold-blood.html|author=Blundell, Nigel|title=Alive and safe, the brutal Japanese soldiers who butchered 20,000 Allied seamen in cold blood|publisher=Mail Online (Associated Newspapers Ltd.)|date=November 3, 2007|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Attacks on neutral powers===\n[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Arizona (BB-39)]] burning during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]\nArticle 1 of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''III \u2013 The Opening of Hostilities'' prohibited the initiation of hostilities against neutral powers \"without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned [[declaration of war]] or of an [[ultimatum]] with conditional declaration of war\" and Article 2 further stated that \"[t]he existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph.\" Japanese diplomats intended to deliver the notice to the United States thirty minutes before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, but it was delivered to the U.S. government an hour after the attack was over.

In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace.

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.\n* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir\u014d Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].\n* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

During the 1990s, the [[South Korea]]n government started investigating some people who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military.<ref>[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004181952/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\">[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004182014/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref> In South Korea, it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the [[Cold War]], many such people or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence with the wealth they had acquired collaborating with the Japanese and assisted in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves. With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749467.stm |title=World &#124; Asia-Pacific &#124; Korean WWII sex slaves fight on |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1846 |title=''Ex-sex slave narrates: \"Japan Boiled Comfort Woman to Make Soup\".

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter.

The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts.

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

The eight aircrew were forbidden to give any defense and, despite the lack of legitimate evidences, were found guilty of participating in aerial military operations against Japan. Five of the eight sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; the other three airmen were taken to a cemetery outside Shanghai, where they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on October 14, 1942.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Doolittle Raid 1942: America's first strike back at Japan (Campaign) |author=Clayton Chun |date=January 31, 2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 85] |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=1-84176-918-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II: The Myths and the Facts |author=Stewart Halsey Ross |date=December 13, 2002 |page=59 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-7864-1412-X}}</ref>\n\nThe Enemy Airmen's Act contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Allied airmen throughout the Pacific War.

In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters&nbsp;... They cut it [into] small pieces and fried it.\"<ref>[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill books, 2002, p. 236.</ref>\n\nIn some cases, flesh was cut from living people: another Indian POW, ''[[Lance Naik]]'' Hatam Ali (later a citizen of [[Pakistan]]), testified in [[New Guinea]] and stated:\n\n{{Quote|...&nbsp;the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80&nbsp;km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.<ref>[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill books, 2002, p. 121.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to another account by Jemadar Abdul Latif of 4/9 Jat Regiment of the Indian Army who was rescued by the Australian army at the Sepik Bay in 1945:\n\n{{quote|At the village of Suaid, a Japanese medical officer periodically visited the Indian compound and selected each time the healthiest men.

[[Yoshio Tachibana]] (\u7acb\u82b1\u82b3\u592b,''Tachibana Yoshio''), who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in August 1946 in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, during August 1944, on [[Chichijima incident|Chichi Jima]], in the [[Bonin Islands]]. The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and \"prevention of honorable burial\". Tachibana was sentenced to death, and hanged.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093731/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm |date=2006-12-08 }} ''''Case No. 21 Trial Of General Tomoyuki Yamashita[,&#93; United States Military Commission, Manila, (8 October-7 December 1945), and the Supreme Court Of The United States (Judgments Delivered On 4 February 1946).

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''. Columbia University Press</ref>\n\nThe controversy was re-ignited on 1 March 2007, when Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] mentioned suggestions that a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] committee would call on the Japanese Government to \"apologise for and acknowledge\" the role of the Japanese Imperial military in wartime sex slavery. Abe denied that it applied to comfort stations. \"There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030100578.html |title=''Washington Post'', \"Japan's Abe: no proof of WWII sex slaves\" |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2013-07-21 |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi}}</ref> Abe's comments provoked negative reactions overseas. For example, a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial on March 6 said:<ref>''New York Times'', \"No comfort\", March 6, 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/opinion/06tues3.html, accessed March 8, 2007</ref>\n{{quote|These were not commercial brothels.

The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]\nSoon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These numbers included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Koreans.<ref>Dower, John (2000). ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', p. 447</ref> The Class-A charges were all tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as \"the Tokyo Trials\". Other courts were formed in many different places in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Tokyo Trials===\n{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.\n\nHigh-ranking officers who were tried included [[K\u014dichi Kido]] and [[Sadao Araki]]. Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.\n* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir\u014d Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].\n* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

The activities of the fund have been controversial in Japan, as well as with international organisations supporting the women concerned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\nSome argue that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. [[California]] [[Congressman]] [[Mike Honda]], speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that \"without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day.

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.

The musical's original 1954 London production ran for 2,078 performances, making it briefly the third-longest running musical in West End or Broadway history (after ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'') until these were all surpassed by ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]''.  The Boy Friend marked [[Julie Andrews]]' American stage debut.\n\nSet in the carefree world of the [[French Riviera]] in the [[Roaring Twenties]], ''The Boy Friend'' is a comic [[pastiche]] of 1920s shows (in particular early [[Rodgers and Hart]] musicals such as ''[[The Girl Friend]]''). Its relatively small cast and low cost of production makes it a continuing popular choice for amateur and student groups.\n\nSandy Wilson wrote a sequel to ''The Boy Friend''. Set ten years later, and, appropriately, a pastiche of 1930s musicals (in particular those of [[Cole Porter]]) it was titled ''[[Divorce Me, Darling!]]'' and ran for 91 performances at London's [[Gielgud Theatre|old Globe Theatre]] in 1965. It is sometimes revived as a \"double bill\" with ''The Boy Friend''.\n\nThe original score and manuscripts for the script and lyrics can be found in Wilson's archive at the [[Harry Ransom Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00176|title=Sandy Wilson: A Preliminary Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Productions==\n\n===London===\nThe musical was first performed in [[London]] in 1953. It opened at the [[Players' Theatre|Players' Theatre Club]] on 14 April 1953, and reopened in an expanded version on 13 October. It transferred for a short season to the [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]], Swiss Cottage and then opened at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on 14 January 1954. Choreography was by John Heawood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372810/otherworks?ref_=nm_pdt_wrk_sm|title=John Heawood, Other Works|work=IMDB.com}} {{unreliable?|date=January 2020}}</ref> The light, tuneful piece proved immensely popular with the British public, including [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Elizabeth's most stylish outfits|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG11546033/4/Queen-Elizabeths-style-hits.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=20 January 2020}}</ref> and ran for more than five years, a total of 2,082 performances.\n\nThe principal role of Polly Browne was to have been played by Diana Maddox, who fell sick on the afternoon of the final dress rehearsal. [[Anne Rogers]] (at that point playing a minor role) volunteered to take over, having learnt the role on her own. The show opened the following evening and made an overnight star of Rogers, who stayed with the production through its expanded versions to the triumphant West End first night at Wyndham's. The cast also included [[Hugh Paddick]] in his first leading [[West End theatre|West End]] role as Percival Browne,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/13/guardianobituaries1|title=Hugh Paddick|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2000-11-13|last1=Dixon|first1=Stephen}}</ref> [[Joan Sterndale-Bennett]] as Madam Dubonnet, and [[Violetta Farjeon]] as Hortense.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11746963/Violetta-Farjeon-actress-obituary.html Violetta Farjeon, actress - obituary.] ''The Telegraph'', 17 July 2015. Retrieved 31 December 2017.</ref>\n\nOn 29 November 1967 a new production opened at the Comedy Theatre, directed by Sandy Wilson and co-produced by Michael Codron and the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre. It starred Tony Adams as Tony, Frances Barlow as Maisie, Marion Grimaldi as Mdm Dubonnet, Jeremy Hawk as Percival Browne, Geoffrey Hibbert as Lord Brockhurst, Celia Helda as Lady Brockhurst, Cheryl Kennedy as Polly Browne. It closed on 12 October 1968 after 365 performances. \n\n1984 saw Cameron Macintosh's 30th anniversary production opened at The Churchill Theatre in Bromley. Directed by its creator, Sandy Wilson, it starred [[Glynis Johns]] as Madam Dubonett and Derek Waring as Percival Browne. It transferred to The Old Vic Theatre (London) then The Ed Mirvish Theatre (Toronto) before starting a West End run at The Albery Theatre in St Martins Lane. Glynis Johns was replaced by Anna Quayle when it reached the West End.\n\nIn 1995, on its 40th anniversary, the musical returned to The Players' Theatre in London in a new production that was as near a reproduction of the original as possible. It was directed by [[Maria Charles]], who had played the original Dulcie. The choreography was by Geoffrey Webb who was also in the original production. It was originally planned that the choreography would be done by Larry Drew, the original Bobby van Husen, but he died suddenly during the early planning stages of the production. Set design was by [[Disley Jones]] who was responsible for the hat designs in the original production. Among the cast were Gemma Page, Oliver Hickey, [[Sophie Louise Dann]] and [[John Rutland]] (in his original role as Lord Brockhurst). Following its success at the Players' it went on a nationwide tour and was very successful.\n\nA production played in 2006 at the Open Air Theatre at Regent's Park, London. This also proved to be acclaimed, and was revived during the Open Air Theatre's 2007 season.\n\n''The Boy Friend'' was the chosen title for the Showtime Challenge 2011 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], London, produced by Eyebrow Productions. Rehearsals took place over a 48-hour period immediately prior to the performance on Sunday 8 May, and all proceeds went to [[The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts]].\n\n===Broadway===\n[[File:Eric Berry in The Boy Friend 1955.jpg|thumb|From the original Broadway production, clockwise from left: Stella Claire, Lyn Connorty, [[Eric Berry (actor)|Eric Berry]], [[Dilys Lay]], [[Millicent Martin]] (1955) ]]\n''The Boy Friend'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Royale Theatre]] on 30 September 1954 and closed on 26 November 1955 after 485 performances. Starring was newcomer [[Julie Andrews]] in her Broadway debut as Polly, with a cast including [[Eric Berry (actor)|Eric Berry]], [[John Hewer]], [[Geoffrey Hibbert]], [[Dilys Laye]], [[Bob Scheerer]], [[Stella Claire]], Ann Wakefield, [[Millicent Martin]] and [[Moyna Macgill]]. Some of them had connections with The Players' Theatre in London, but only Wakefield had appeared in the show's London production (in the very first run at the Players'). For the Broadway opening, veteran orchestrator [[Ted Royal]] and jazzman [[Charles L. Cooke]] contributed 1920s-style arrangements.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nFor her Broadway debut, Andrews received the [[Theatre World Award]]. ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' producers saw her in this piece, prompting her casting in the lead in that production, which led to her wider fame on Broadway and beyond in the following years.

Act I begins when Hortense orders a costume for \"a Miss Polly Browne\" and Maisie and the other girls (Dulcie, Nancy, and Fay) sing the ironic \"Perfect Young Ladies\" with Hortense. Polly arrives and tells everyone about her made-up boy friend who is \"motoring down from Paris\" to meet her for the upcoming carnival ball, and sings about \"The Boy Friend\". Later, Bobby surprises Maisie, and they dance to \"Won't You Charleston With Me?\"\n\nPolly's widowed father, Percy, then arrives at the school to discover that the headmistress, Mme Dubonnet, is an old flame of his. They sing \"Fancy Forgetting\" to rekindle the spark. Polly, though a millionaire's daughter, feels left out because she is the only one of her friends who does not have a boyfriend and she needs a partner for the [[fancy dress]] ball. The errand boy, Tony, arrives to deliver her Pierrette costume and they are immediately attracted to each other, and sing \"I Could Be Happy With You.\"\n\n===Act II===\nThe curtain opens with the chorus number \"Sur la Plage\". After this dance number, Polly and Tony meet at the beach and Polly lies that she is not rich to fit in with Tony. They sing about their future lives together in \"A Room in [[Bloomsbury]].\" They are at the verge of kissing when Hortense interrupts them and is shocked to find Polly with a poor messenger boy. Polly begs Hortense to keep her secret and Hortense agrees. After Tony and Polly leave, Hortense sings how everything is \"Nicer in Nice\" with the ensemble. After that, The \"aging rou\u00e9\" character Lord Brockhurst arrives on the scene, leading to a comical meeting with the rigidly mannered Percival Browne. Lord Brockhurst's domineering wife Lady Brockhurst is also introduced. Percival Browne and Mme Dubonnet then sing \"The 'You-Don't-Want-To-Play-With-Me' Blues\".\n\nWhen Polly goes to meet Tony on the promenade, Lord and Lady Brockhurst, who are passing by, recognize him. When he runs off, everyone else assumes that he is a thief. The act ends with a reprise of \"I Could be Happy with You\" sung by Polly and the other characters on a sad note.\n\n===Act III===\nAt the ball, Bobby and the three boys propose to Maisie and the three girls, but the girls reply in unison that \"we'll let you know at midnight\" and everyone dances to \"The Riviera\". After everyone has left, Tony and Hortense run into each other. Hortense scolds Tony and tells him to meet Polly at the ball because she loves him as much as he loves her. Tony leaves to prepare for the ball as Lord Brockhurst sings \"It's Never Too Late To Fall In Love\" with the flirty Dulcie, and is caught by Lady Brockhurst. At the Carnival ball, Polly is sad that Tony is not there and she is thinking about leaving. Hortense tells Mme Dubonnet to persuade Polly to stay, so Polly sings \"Poor Little Pierrette\" with Mme Dubonnet. Tony later arrives at the ball and takes Polly by surprise. He asks \"May I have this dance, Pierrette?\" to which Polly replies, \"I'm afraid I can't dance with a stranger\". He then kisses her to remind her that it is he. When Tony removes his mask, Lord and Lady Brockhurst run to him, exclaiming they found their son at last. Polly and the others discover that Tony is really the son of the rich Lord and Lady Brockhurst, and he had left home to try to make his own way in the world. Polly tells Tony that she is actually rich as well, and Percy and Mme Dubonnet announce that they are getting married. The clock strikes midnight, and the girls unanimously say yes to the boys' proposals. The last scene has everyone dancing as soon as Bobby, with the last spoken line in the play, asks \"So how about that dance?\" The show ends with a reprise of \"The Boy Friend\", \"I Could Be Happy With You\", and \"A Room In Bloomsbury\".\n\n== Songs ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n;Act I\n* Perfect Young Ladies - Hortense, Maisie, Dulcie, Fay, Nancy, Ensemble\n* The Boy Friend - Polly, Dulcie, Maisie, Fay, Nancy, Marcel, Pierre, Alphonse, Ensemble\n* Won't You [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] With Me? - Bobby, Maisie\n* Fancy Forgetting - Mme Dubonnet, Percival\n* I Could Be Happy with You - Polly, Tony\n* Finale Act 1 - Ensemble\n{{col-break}}\n;Act II\n* Sur La Plage - Dulcie, Nancy, Ensemble\n* A Room in Bloomsbury - Tony, Polly\n* Nicer in Nice - Hortense ensemble\n* The You-Don't-Want-to-Play-with-Me Blues - Mme Dubonnet, Percival\n* Safety in Numbers - Maisie, Bobby, Marcel, Alphonse, Pierre\n* I Could Be Happy with You (Reprise) - Polly, Tony\n* Finale Act 2 - ALL\n{{col-break}}\n;Act III\n* The Riviera - Bobby, Maisie, Dulcie, Fay, Nancy, Marcel, Alphonse, Pierre, Ensemble\n* It's Never Too Late to Fall in Love - Lord Brockhurst, Dulcie\n* Carnival Tango - Tango Dancers\n* Poor Little Pierrette - Mme Dubonnet, Polly\n* Finale Act 3 - ALL\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Film version ==\n{{Main|The Boy Friend (1971 film)}}\n[[Ken Russell]]'s 1971 film version of the show, starring [[Twiggy]] and [[Christopher Gable]], was an alternative interpretation, weaving the basic plot into a more complicated story in which a seaside dramatic company performing the show, is visited by an influential film producer ([[Vladek Sheybal]]) on the very night that the leading lady ([[Glenda Jackson]]) has to be replaced by the assistant stage manager Polly Browne (Twiggy).

The musical's original 1954 London production ran for 2,078 performances, making it briefly the third-longest running musical in West End or Broadway history (after ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'') until these were all surpassed by ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]''.  This musical marked [[Julie Andrews]]' American stage debut.\n\nSet in the carefree world of the [[French Riviera]] in the [[Roaring Twenties]], ''The Boy Friend'' is a comic [[pastiche]] of 1920s shows (in particular early [[Rodgers and Hart]] musicals such as ''[[The Girl Friend]]''). Its relatively small cast and low cost of production makes it a continuing popular choice for amateur and student groups.\n\nSandy Wilson wrote a sequel to ''The Boy Friend''. Set ten years later, and, appropriately, a pastiche of 1930s musicals (in particular those of [[Cole Porter]]) it was titled ''[[Divorce Me, Darling!]]'' and ran for 91 performances at London's [[Gielgud Theatre|old Globe Theatre]] in 1965. It is sometimes revived as a \"double bill\" with ''The Boy Friend''.\n\nThe original score and manuscripts for the script and lyrics can be found in Wilson's archive at the [[Harry Ransom Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00176|title=Sandy Wilson: A Preliminary Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Productions==\n\n===London===\nThe musical was first performed in [[London]] in 1953. It opened at the [[Players' Theatre|Players' Theatre Club]] on 14 April 1953, and reopened in an expanded version on 13 October. It transferred for a short season to the [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]], Swiss Cottage and then opened at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on 14 January 1954. Choreography was by John Heawood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372810/otherworks?ref_=nm_pdt_wrk_sm|title=John Heawood, Other Works|work=IMDB.com}} {{unreliable?|date=January 2020}}</ref> The light, tuneful piece proved immensely popular with the British public, including [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Elizabeth's most stylish outfits|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG11546033/4/Queen-Elizabeths-style-hits.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=20 January 2020}}</ref> and ran for more than five years, a total of 2,082 performances.\n\nThe principal role of Polly Browne was to have been played by Diana Maddox, who fell sick on the afternoon of the final dress rehearsal. [[Anne Rogers]] (at that point playing a minor role) volunteered to take over, having learnt the role on her own. The show opened the following evening and made an overnight star of Rogers, who stayed with the production through its expanded versions to the triumphant West End first night at Wyndham's. The cast also included [[Hugh Paddick]] in his first leading [[West End theatre|West End]] role as Percival Browne,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/13/guardianobituaries1|title=Hugh Paddick|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2000-11-13|last1=Dixon|first1=Stephen}}</ref> [[Joan Sterndale-Bennett]] as Madam Dubonnet, and [[Violetta Farjeon]] as Hortense.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11746963/Violetta-Farjeon-actress-obituary.html Violetta Farjeon, actress - obituary.] ''The Telegraph'', 17 July 2015.

It starred Tony Adams as Tony, Frances Barlow as Maisie, Marion Grimaldi as Mdm Dubonnet, Jeremy Hawk as Percival Browne, Geoffrey Hibbert as Lord Brockhurst, Celia Helda as Lady Brockhurst, Cheryl Kennedy as Polly Browne. It closed on 12 October 1968 after 365 performances. \n\n1984 saw Cameron Macintosh's 30th anniversary production opened at The Churchill Theatre in Bromley. Directed by its creator, Sandy Wilson, it starred [[Glynis Johns]] as Madam Dubonett and Derek Waring as Percival Browne. It transferred to The Old Vic Theatre (London) then The Ed Mirvish Theatre (Toronto) before starting a West End run at The Albery Theatre in St Martins Lane. Glynis Johns was replaced by Anna Quayle when it reached the West End.\n\nIn 1995, on its 40th anniversary, the musical returned to The Players' Theatre in London in a new production that was as near a reproduction of the original as possible. It was directed by [[Maria Charles]], who had played the original Dulcie. The choreography was by Geoffrey Webb who was also in the original production. It was originally planned that the choreography would be done by Larry Drew, the original Bobby van Husen, but he died suddenly during the early planning stages of the production. Set design was by [[Disley Jones]] who was responsible for the hat designs in the original production. Among the cast were Gemma Page, Oliver Hickey, [[Sophie Louise Dann]] and [[John Rutland]] (in his original role as Lord Brockhurst). Following its success at the Players' it went on a nationwide tour and was very successful.\n\nA production played in 2006 at the Open Air Theatre at Regent's Park, London. This also proved to be acclaimed, and was revived during the Open Air Theatre's 2007 season.\n\n''The Boy Friend'' was the chosen title for the Showtime Challenge 2011 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], London, produced by Eyebrow Productions. Rehearsals took place over a 48-hour period immediately prior to the performance on Sunday 8 May, and all proceeds went to [[The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts]].\n\n===Broadway===\n[[File:Eric Berry in The Boy Friend 1955.jpg|thumb|From the original Broadway production, clockwise from left: Stella Claire, Lyn Connorty, [[Eric Berry (actor)|Eric Berry]], [[Dilys Lay]], [[Millicent Martin]] (1955) ]]\n''The Boy Friend'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Royale Theatre]] on 30 September 1954 and closed on 26 November 1955 after 485 performances.

''[[My Fair Lady]]'' producers saw her in this piece, prompting her casting in the lead in that production, which led to her wider fame on Broadway and beyond in the following years.
