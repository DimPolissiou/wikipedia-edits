The album was recorded in July of that year, on the initial leg of Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. The second leg, a more [[Soul music|soul]]-oriented affair following recording sessions in Philadelphia for the bulk of ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'', would be renamed '[[Philadelphia soul|Philly]] Dogs', as reflected on a different live release, ''[[Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles '74)|Cracked Actor]]'' (2017).\n\nThe album catches Bowie in transition from the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]/[[Aladdin Sane]]'' glam-rock era of his career to the '[[plastic soul]]' of ''Young Americans''. While the cover featured a picture of Bowie in his latest soul threads \u2013 baggy trouser suit complete with shoulder pads and braces from October 1974 \u2013 the music was recorded in July of that year when he was showcasing his two most recent studio albums of original material, ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and ''Aladdin Sane'', as well as selected favourites from ''Ziggy Stardust'' and earlier.\n\nThe tour was Bowie's most ambitious to date, featuring a giant set designed to evoke \"Hunger City\", the post-apocalyptic setting for ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'', and his largest band, led by [[Michael Kamen]]. For \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (recorded at the time but not released until the album's 2005 reissue) Bowie sang using a radio microphone disguised as a telephone whilst being raised and lowered above the stage by a [[cherry picker|cherry picker crane]]. The tour was documented in [[Alan Yentob]]'s ''[[Cracked Actor]]'' (1975).\n\n==Background and recording==\nCapturing the music on tape was itself problematic; most of the backing vocals, as well as the saxophone and the piano solo for \"Aladdin Sane\", needed to be overdubbed in the studio later (a fact noted on the original album sleeve) because the performers were often off-mike. According to the original album liner notes: \"This Live album was culled from performances on the 14th & 15th July 1974 at the Tower Theatre, Philadelphia. It is complete and exact. No studio overdubs or re-recording of voices, instruments or audience have been added with the exception of several backing vocals due to loss of theatre mike contact.\" Also worth noting, there is \u2013 as Nic Pegg puts it \u2013 a 'degree of confusion [that] surrounds the dates of the recordings, which are given incorrectly on some reissues: according to Tony Visconti the correct dates are 11 and 12 July 1974'. <ref>Pegg, p. 373</ref> However, according to collector Jens D\u00f6pke, it is the first pressing that has incorrect recording dates on the inside of the fold-out cover: \"14th & 15th July 1974\". These dates must be incorrect because Bowie played The Tower Theater for six nights, from 8 July to 13 July. D\u00f6pke goes on to say: \"On later pressings, this error has been corrected (although the new dates given, 12-13/07/1974, are still not entirely correct).\" D\u00f6pke notes the corrected pressings begin from October 1974, which given the first pressing was released on 21 October 1974, the mistake must have been realised and corrected during the run up to release. The correct dates of the recording, according to D\u00f6pke, are 10-13/07/1974. <ref>http://www.bowie-collection.de/</ref> The Tower Theater concerts also gave rise to a backstage revolt by Bowie's touring band. Having been informed on short notice that the concerts would be professionally recorded for official release, and that Bowie's management intended to pay them only the standard union fee required for a live recording (a mere $70), the band confronted Bowie an hour before the first show and refused to take the stage unless they received $5,000 each.<ref name=Stardust>{{citation | last1=Edwards | first1=Henry | last2=Zanetta | first2=Tony | title=Stardust: The David Bowie Story | year=1986 | isbn=0-07-072797-X | url=https://archive.org/details/stardustdavidbow00edwa }}</ref>\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score =  {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r736051|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2Score =  {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web |title=David Live \u2013 Blender |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/back-catalogue/53909/david-live.html |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |accessdate=16 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711124241/http://www.blender.com/guide/back-catalogue/53909/david-live.html |archivedate=11 July 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev3Score = C\u2013<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: B|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=B&bk=70|accessdate=22 February 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n| rev4 = [[The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]\n| rev4score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev5 = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev5score = 3/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151 151]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151}}</ref>\n| rev6 = [[Pitchfork Media]]\n| rev6Score =  7.7/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11681-david-live-stage/ |title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: David Bowie: David Live / Stage |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev7Score =  {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |title=David Bowie: Album Guide |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530073307/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |archivedate=30 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev8Score = 4/5<ref>{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=Nick|date=November 1990 |title=Diamond Jubilation |work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|p=124}}</ref>\n}}\nThe finished album has been criticised for Bowie's 'obsessive' rearrangements of the songs and for the strained quality of his vocals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Opinion of the playing is also divided, despite the presence of such acclaimed guests as Michael Kamen, [[Earl Slick]] and [[David Sanborn]], as well as Flowers, [[Mike Garson]] and [[Tony Newman (drummer)|Tony Newman]] from the ''Diamond Dogs'' sessions. However some of the interpretations earned praise, such as the upbeat jazz-Latin version of \"[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane]]\" and the atmospheric instrumental additions to \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World''. The record is also notable for including Bowie's first release of \"[[All the Young Dudes (song)|All the Young Dudes]],\" a song originally given to the band [[Mott the Hoople]] for their 1972 album of the same name.\n\n[[Mick Jagger]] commented about the album at the time, saying he thought \"[[Knock on Wood (song)|Knock on Wood]]\" was \"awful\".  Jagger went on to say, \"If I got the kind of reviews that he got for that album, I would honestly never record again.  Never.\"<ref>The Rolling Stones \u2013 Off The Record by [[Mark Paytress]], [[Omnibus Press]], 2005, page 245. {{ISBN|1-84449-641-4}}</ref>\n\nBowie later commented that \"''David Live'' was the final death of Ziggy\u2026 And that photo on the cover.

The album was recorded in July of that year, on the initial leg of Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. The second leg, a more [[Soul music|soul]]-oriented affair following recording sessions in Philadelphia for the bulk of ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'', would be renamed '[[Philadelphia soul|Philly]] Dogs', as reflected on a different live release, ''[[Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles '74)|Cracked Actor]]'' (2017).\n\nThe album catches Bowie in transition from the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]/[[Aladdin Sane]]'' glam-rock era of his career to the '[[plastic soul]]' of ''Young Americans''. While the cover featured a picture of Bowie in his latest soul threads \u2013 baggy trouser suit complete with shoulder pads and braces from October 1974 \u2013 the music was recorded in July of that year when he was showcasing his two most recent studio albums of original material, ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and ''Aladdin Sane'', as well as selected favourites from ''Ziggy Stardust'' and earlier.\n\nThe tour was Bowie's most ambitious to date, featuring a giant set designed to evoke \"Hunger City\", the post-apocalyptic setting for ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'', and his largest band, led by [[Michael Kamen]]. For \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (recorded at the time but not released until the album's 2005 reissue) Bowie sang using a radio microphone disguised as a telephone whilst being raised and lowered above the stage by a [[cherry picker|cherry picker crane]]. The tour was documented in [[Alan Yentob]]'s ''[[Cracked Actor]]'' (1975).\n\n==Background and recording==\nCapturing the music on tape was itself problematic; most of the backing vocals, as well as the saxophone and the piano solo for \"Aladdin Sane\", needed to be overdubbed in the studio later (a fact noted on the original album sleeve) because the performers were often off-mike. According to the original album liner notes: \"This Live album was culled from performances on the 14th & 15th July 1974 at the Tower Theatre, Philadelphia. It is complete and exact. No studio overdubs or re-recording of voices, instruments or audience have been added with the exception of several backing vocals due to loss of theatre mike contact.\" Also worth noting, there is \u2013 as Nic Pegg puts it \u2013 a 'degree of confusion [that] surrounds the dates of the recordings, which are given incorrectly on some reissues: according to Tony Visconti the correct dates are 11 and 12 July 1974'. <ref>Pegg, p. 373</ref> However, according to collector Jens D\u00f6pke, it is the first pressing that has incorrect recording dates on the inside of the fold-out cover: \"14th & 15th July 1974\". These dates must be incorrect because Bowie played The Tower Theater for six nights, from 8 July to 13 July. D\u00f6pke goes on to say: \"On later pressings, this error has been corrected (although the new dates given, 12-13/07/1974, are still not entirely correct).\" D\u00f6pke notes the corrected pressings begin from October 1974, which given the first pressing was released on 21 October 1974, the mistake must have been realised and corrected during the run up to release. The correct dates of the recording, according to D\u00f6pke, are 10-13/07/1974. <ref>http://www.bowie-collection.de/</ref> The Tower Theater concerts also gave rise to a backstage revolt by Bowie's touring band. Having been informed on short notice that the concerts would be professionally recorded for official release, and that Bowie's management intended to pay them only the standard union fee required for a live recording (a mere $70), the band confronted Bowie an hour before the first show and refused to take the stage unless they received $5,000 each.<ref name=Stardust>{{citation | last1=Edwards | first1=Henry | last2=Zanetta | first2=Tony | title=Stardust: The David Bowie Story | year=1986 | isbn=0-07-072797-X | url=https://archive.org/details/stardustdavidbow00edwa }}</ref>\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score =  {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r736051|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2Score =  {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web |title=David Live \u2013 Blender |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/back-catalogue/53909/david-live.html |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |accessdate=16 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711124241/http://www.blender.com/guide/back-catalogue/53909/david-live.html |archivedate=11 July 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev3Score = C\u2013<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: B|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=B&bk=70|accessdate=22 February 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n| rev4 = [[The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]\n| rev4score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev5 = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev5score = 3/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151 151]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151}}</ref>\n| rev6 = [[Pitchfork Media]]\n| rev6Score =  7.7/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11681-david-live-stage/ |title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: David Bowie: David Live / Stage |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev7Score =  {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |title=David Bowie: Album Guide |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530073307/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |archivedate=30 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev8Score = 4/5<ref>{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=Nick|date=November 1990 |title=Diamond Jubilation |work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|p=124}}</ref>\n}}\nThe finished album has been criticised for Bowie's 'obsessive' rearrangements of the songs and for the strained quality of his vocals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Opinion of the playing is also divided, despite the presence of such acclaimed guests as Michael Kamen, [[Earl Slick]] and [[David Sanborn]], as well as Flowers, [[Mike Garson]] and [[Tony Newman (drummer)|Tony Newman]] from the ''Diamond Dogs'' sessions. However some of the interpretations earned praise, such as the upbeat jazz-Latin version of \"[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane]]\" and the atmospheric instrumental additions to \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World''. The record is also notable for including Bowie's first release of \"[[All the Young Dudes (song)|All the Young Dudes]],\" a song originally given to the band [[Mott the Hoople]] for their 1972 album of the same name.\n\n[[Mick Jagger]] commented about the album at the time, saying he thought \"[[Knock on Wood (song)|Knock on Wood]]\" was \"awful\".  Jagger went on to say, \"If I got the kind of reviews that he got for that album, I would honestly never record again.  Never.\"<ref>The Rolling Stones \u2013 Off The Record by [[Mark Paytress]], [[Omnibus Press]], 2005, page 245. {{ISBN|1-84449-641-4}}</ref>\n\nBowie later commented that \"''David Live'' was the final death of Ziggy\u2026 And that photo on the cover. My God, it looks like I've just stepped out of the grave. That's actually how I felt.

The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBeginning on 11 August 1974, during breaks in David Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], ''Young Americans'' was recorded by [[Tony Visconti]] primarily at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in [[Philadelphia]]. It was agreed early on to record as much of the album as possible live, with the full band playing together, including Bowie's vocals, as a single continuous take for each song. According to Visconti, the album contains \"about 85% 'live' David Bowie\".<ref name=golden>{{cite web |editor-last=Griffen |editor-first=Roger |title=Young Americans |url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/youngamericans.html |work=Bowie Golden Years |accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nTo create a more authentically soulful sound, Bowie brought in musicians from the [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] community, including an early-career [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Andy Newmark]], drummer of [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. It was also Bowie's first time working with [[Carlos Alomar]], leading to a working relationship spanning more than 30 years.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe song \"[[Young Americans (song)|Young Americans]]\", which Bowie said was about \"the predicament of two newlyweds\", took two days to record.<ref name=wide_eye>{{cite book |last1=Kamp |first1=Thomas |title=David Bowie: The Wild-Eyed Boy 1964\u20131984 |publisher=O'Sullivan, Woodside & Co. |edition=1st |year=1985}}</ref> [[David Sanborn]], at the time a [[session musician]], is featured on saxophone.<ref name=linernotes />\n\nThe sessions at Sigma Sound lasted through November 1974.<ref name=golden /> The recording attracted the attention of local fans, who began to wait outside the studio over the span of the sessions. Bowie built up a rapport with these fans, whom he came to refer to as the \"Sigma Kids\". On the final day of tracking, the Sigma Kids were invited into the studio to listen to rough versions of the new songs.<ref name=strange>{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=David |title=Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story |year=2005 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-1002-2 |pages=190\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Fascination (David Bowie song)|Fascination]]\" and \"Win\" were recorded at [[Record Plant]] in [[New York City]] in December 1974. Visconti then returned to London to begin mixing the album, while Bowie remained in New York. Unbeknownst to Visconti, Bowie took the opportunity to record with [[John Lennon]] in January 1975, with engineer Harry Maslin as co-producer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Visconti |first=Tony |title=Tony Visconti: the Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy |year=2007 |publisher=Harper |pages=222-224}}</ref> \"[[Across the Universe]]\" and \"Fame\" were recorded at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York in January 1975, with contributions by Lennon. They replaced previously recorded tracks \"Who Can I Be Now\" and \"It's Gonna Be Me\", which were later released as bonus tracks on reissues of the album. The guitar riff for \"Fame\", created by Alomar, was based on an arrangement of his for the song \"Foot Stompin'\" by the [[doo-wop]] band [[the Flairs]].<ref name=bowiezone>{{cite web |title=Bowie Biography |url=http://bowiezone.com/#/bowie-biography-3/4547994548 |work=Bowie Zone |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> Bowie considered several titles for the album, including ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'', ''One Damned Song'', ''The Gouster'', and ''Fascination''.<ref name=wide_eye />\n\n==Packaging==\nFor the album [[cover art]]work, Bowie initially wanted to commission [[Norman Rockwell]] to create a painting, but retracted the offer when he heard that Rockwell would need at least six months to do the job. The album's cover photo was eventually taken in [[Los Angeles]] on August 30, 1974, by Eric Stephen Jacobs. Bowie's apparent inspiration for the cover photograph came from a copy of ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' magazine which featured another of Jacobs' photographs of Bowie's then choreographer [[Toni Basil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/theyearofthediamonddog/youngamericanssessions.htm|title=Young Americans Sessions|publisher=}}</ref>\nThe cover itself, as well as the cover

Bowie drew influence from the sound of \"local dance halls\", which were blaring with the \"lush strings, sliding hi-hat whispers, and swanky R&B rhythms of [[Philadelphia soul|Philadelphia Soul]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van Schaik|first1=Lauren|title=Today in Music History: Bowie Starts Recording at Sigma Sound|url=http://laurenvanschaik.com/today-in-music-history-david-bowie-starts-recording-young-americans-at-sigma-sound/|website=laurenvanschaik.com|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Later sessions took place in New York City, including contributions from [[John Lennon]].\n\nBowie was among the first English pop musicians of the era to overtly engage with black musical styles. The album was very successful in the US; reaching the Top 10 in the [[Billboard 200|Billboard]] charts, with the song \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" hitting the number-one the same year the album was released.<ref name=mtv /> It was generally well-received by critics. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBeginning on 11 August 1974, during breaks in David Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], ''Young Americans'' was recorded by [[Tony Visconti]] primarily at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in [[Philadelphia]]. It was agreed early on to record as much of the album as possible live, with the full band playing together, including Bowie's vocals, as a single continuous take for each song. According to Visconti, the album contains \"about 85% 'live' David Bowie\".<ref name=golden>{{cite web |editor-last=Griffen |editor-first=Roger |title=Young Americans |url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/youngamericans.html |work=Bowie Golden Years |accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nTo create a more authentically soulful sound, Bowie brought in musicians from the [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] community, including an early-career [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Andy Newmark]], drummer of [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. It was also Bowie's first time working with [[Carlos Alomar]], leading to a working relationship spanning more than 30 years.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe song \"[[Young Americans (song)|Young Americans]]\", which Bowie said was about \"the predicament of two newlyweds\", took two days to record.<ref name=wide_eye>{{cite book |last1=Kamp |first1=Thomas |title=David Bowie: The Wild-Eyed Boy 1964\u20131984 |publisher=O'Sullivan, Woodside & Co. |edition=1st |year=1985}}</ref> [[David Sanborn]], at the time a [[session musician]], is featured on saxophone.<ref name=linernotes />\n\nThe sessions at Sigma Sound lasted through November 1974.<ref name=golden /> The recording attracted the attention of local fans, who began to wait outside the studio over the span of the sessions. Bowie built up a rapport with these fans, whom he came to refer to as the \"Sigma Kids\". On the final day of tracking, the Sigma Kids were invited into the studio to listen to rough versions of the new songs.<ref name=strange>{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=David |title=Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story |year=2005 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-1002-2 |pages=190\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Fascination (David Bowie song)|Fascination]]\" and \"Win\" were recorded at [[Record Plant]] in [[New York City]] in December 1974. Visconti then returned to London to begin mixing the album, while Bowie remained in New York. Unbeknownst to Visconti, Bowie took the opportunity to record with [[John Lennon]] in January 1975, with engineer Harry Maslin as co-producer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Visconti |first=Tony |title=Tony Visconti: the Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy |year=2007 |publisher=Harper |pages=222-224}}</ref> \"[[Across the Universe]]\" and \"Fame\" were recorded at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York in January 1975, with contributions by Lennon. They replaced previously recorded tracks \"Who Can I Be Now\" and \"It's Gonna Be Me\", which were later released as bonus tracks on reissues of the album. The guitar riff for \"Fame\", created by Alomar, was based on an arrangement of his for the song \"Foot Stompin'\" by the [[doo-wop]] band [[the Flairs]].<ref name=bowiezone>{{cite web |title=Bowie Biography |url=http://bowiezone.com/#/bowie-biography-3/4547994548 |work=Bowie Zone |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> Bowie considered several titles for the album, including ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'', ''One Damned Song'', ''The Gouster'', and ''Fascination''.<ref name=wide_eye />\n\n==Packaging==\nFor the album [[cover art]]work, Bowie initially wanted to commission [[Norman Rockwell]] to create a painting, but retracted the offer when he heard that Rockwell would need at least six months to do the job. The album's cover photo was eventually taken in [[Los Angeles]] on August 30, 1974, by Eric Stephen Jacobs. Bowie's apparent inspiration for the cover photograph came from a copy of ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' magazine which featured another of Jacobs' photographs of Bowie's then choreographer

retrospective review, [[AllMusic]] senior critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that ''Young Americans'' is \"more enjoyable as a stylistic adventure than as a substantive record.\"<ref

or the formal audacity of ''[[Station to Station]]''; at times, it comes off as an artist trying very hard to demonstrate how unpredictable he is.\" Nevertheless, Wolk also praised the fact that \"while there had already been a handful of [[disco]] hits on the pop charts, no other established rock musician had yet tried to do anything similar.\"<ref name=\"p4k-review1\"/>\n\nIn 2013,

Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, ''Station to Station'' was the vehicle for his performance persona, [[the Thin White Duke]]. The album was recorded after he completed shooting [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', and the [[cover art]]work featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially [[cocaine]], and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\">Buckley (2000): pp. 259, 264.</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nMusically, ''Station to Station'' was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the [[funk]] and [[soul music]] of his previous release, ''[[Young Americans]]'', while presenting a new direction influenced by German [[electronic music|electronic]] bands such as [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work with the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\", recorded with [[Brian Eno]] in 1977\u201379. Bowie himself said that ''Station to Station'' was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> The album's lyrics reflected his preoccupations with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Aleister Crowley]], mythology and religion.\n\nDrawing on funk and [[krautrock]], romantic balladry and [[occultism]], ''Station to Station'' has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Preceded by the single \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2012, the album was ranked No. 324 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based Bowie, fuelled by an \"astronomic\" cocaine habit and subsisting on a diet of [[Capsicum|peppers]] and milk, spent much of 1975\u201376 \"in a state of psychic terror\".<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\"/> Stories\u2014mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Rolling Stone''\u2014circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his [[semen]] stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from [[the Rolling Stones]], and living in morbid fear of fellow [[Aleister Crowley]] aficionado [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">Pegg (2004): pp. 297\u2013300.</ref> Bowie would later say of Los Angeles, \"The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite journal |last=McKinnon |first=Angus |title=The Future Isn't What It Used to Be |journal=[[NME]] |date=13 September 1980 |pages=32\u201335}}</ref>\n\nIt was on the set of his first major film, ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called ''The Return of the Thin White Duke''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=So Far Away.. |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=55}}</ref> He was also composing music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]] would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.)<ref>Phillips (1986): p. 290.</ref> Director [[Nicolas Roeg]] warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 260\u2013263.</ref>\n\nThe Thin White Duke became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often during the next six months, for Bowie himself. Impeccably dressed in white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat, the Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity, yet felt nothing\u2014\"ice masquerading as fire\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 78\u201380.</ref> The persona has been described as \"a mad aristocrat\",<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"an amoral zombie\",<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 258.</ref> and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Station to Station'' was recorded in late 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]], Los Angeles. In 1981, ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] surmised that it was cut\u2014\"in 10 days of feverish activity\"\u2014when Bowie decided that there was no hope of his producing a soundtrack for ''The Man Who Fell to Earth''.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> More recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months\u2014with the sessions beginning in late September<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Kevin Cann (2010).

[[Tony Visconti]], who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and co-producing ''[[David Live]]'' and ''Young Americans'', was not involved due to competing schedules.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 269\u2013270.</ref> However, the recording did cement the band line-up that would see Bowie through the rest of the decade, with bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] joining ''Young Americans'' drummer [[Dennis Davis]] and rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nThe recording process developed with this team set the pattern for Bowie's albums up to and including ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' in 1980: backing tracks laid down by Murray, Davis and Alomar; saxophone, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs (here by Bowie, [[Roy Bittan]] and [[Earl Slick]], respectively); lead vocals; and finally various production tricks to complete the song.<ref name=\"Buckley p.270\">Buckley (2000): p. 270.</ref> According to Bowie, \"I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick.

[[Nicholas Pegg]], author of ''The Complete David Bowie'', called it a \"precise halfway point on the journey from ''[[Young Americans]]'' to ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it \"effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with ''Low''.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> In terms of Bowie's own output, ''Station to Station'''s Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like \"[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)]]\" and \"[[Time (David Bowie song)|Time]]\" (1973), while its [[funk]] and [[disco]] elements were a development of the [[soul music|soul]] sound of ''Young Americans'' (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of  [[krautrock]] and [[electronic music]] by bands like [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]].

Backed with \"Word on a Wing\" and accompanied by a video shot especially for the release, it made No. 24 in the UK and charted for ten weeks.<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 625.</ref>\n\nAnother song purportedly recorded during the album sessions at Cherokee Studios, a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City\",<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\"/> went unreleased at the time but was issued in 1989 on the ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound+Vision]]'' box set. Harry Maslin and Carlos Alomar have claimed that they never recorded the song during the Cherokee sessions, while Tony Visconti believes that the song most likely consisted of overdubs to a track originally cut at [[Olympic Studios|Olympic]] and [[Island Studios]] during the ''Diamond Dogs'' sessions, with [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums, [[Herbie Flowers]] on bass and [[Mike Garson]] on

On the Isolar Tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of [[Nazism|Nazi]] memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in [[Stockholm]] as saying that \"Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader\".<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 11.</ref> The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called '[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in ''[[NME]]''. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave,<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie 2\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=The Controversial Homecoming |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=64}}</ref> a contention backed by a young [[Gary Numan]] who was among the crowd that day: \"Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines \"To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading\" from ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''' opening track \"[[It's No Game]]\", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Station to Station'' was a milestone in Bowie's transition to his late 1970s '[[Berlin Trilogy]]'. Bowie himself has said of the album, \"As far as the music goes, ''Low'' and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie pp.205\u2013206\"/> while [[Brian Eno]] opined that ''Low'' was \"very much a continuation from ''Station to Station''\".<ref name=\"Low\">Wilcken (2005): p. 4.</ref> It has also been described as \"enormously influential on [[post-punk]]\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\"/> [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in 1981, \"If ''Low'' was [[Gary Numan]]'s Bowie album, then ''Station to Station'' was [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> However, ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' declared in 2004 that \"just as few had anticipated Bowie's approach, few copied it&nbsp;... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style\".<ref name=\"Stylus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |title=On Second Thought: David Bowie&nbsp;\u2013 Station to Station |author=Mathers, Ian |date=13 April 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66jBYukxy?url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] deemed it a \"[[space rock]] masterpiece\" in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), writing that Bowie had recorded \"the most intense music of his life\".<ref name=\"RS2004\"/> Jem Aswad of [[NPR]] described the album as \"pioneering ice-funk\" that \"paved the way not only for thousands of artists who were influenced by it, but also for the brilliant wave of experimentation that followed over the next five years: ''Low'', ''Heroes'', ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' and ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aswad|first1=Jem|title=Who Can I Be Now?

The album was released again in 1991 by [[Rykodisc]], with two, live bonus tracks;  a 1999 rerelease by [[EMI]] featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound, but lacks bonus tracks.  Both re-releases used a colour version of the cover art, wherein the photograph occupies the entirety of the front cover apart from the red \"STATIONTOSTATIONDAVIDBOWIE\" text on the top. This modified artwork would be standard for CD issues of the album until 2007, when EMI Japan reused the original black-and-white artwork on a mini-LP release. The album was re-released by EMI in Special and Deluxe Editions in 2010, both of which presented the album in a mini-LP replica sleeve, within a larger box.  The Deluxe Edition included stereo and surround sound remixes of the album by coproducer Harry Maslin.\n\nThe album was remastered again in 2016, for inclusion in the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set, with an individual CD release made available the following year. The box set includes both the original 1976 mix and the 2010 stereo remix of ''Station to Station'', individually packaged in mini LP sleeves. The 1976 mix uses the original cover art, while the 2010 mix uses a color-corrected version of the 1991 front cover art; the back cover of the 2010 mix's sleeve is a variant of the 1976 back cover, with burgundy text in place of bright red. The original cover art is also used for the 2017 standalone CD release of the album, which only includes the 1976 mix.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[David Bowie]], except where noted.\n{{tracklist\n|headline= Side one\n|title1 = [[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]\n|length1 = 10:15\n|title2 = [[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\n|length2 = 3:59\n|title3 = [[Word on a Wing]]\n|length3 = 6:04\n}}\n{{tracklist\n|headline= Side two\n|title1 = [[TVC 15]]\n|length1 = 5:31\n|title2 = [[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\n|length2 = 6:16\n|title3 = [[Wild Is the Wind (song)#David Bowie recording|Wild Is the Wind]]\n|lyrics3 = [[Ned Washington]]\n|music3 = [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]\n|length3 = 6:06\n|total_length = 37:57\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u20136 on CD reissues.\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline= 1991 reissue bonus tracks (recorded on 23 March 1976 at [[Nassau Coliseum]], [[Uniondale, New York]]<ref name=\"StS1990\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Station to Station |others=David Bowie |year=1991 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Rykodisc}}</ref>)\n| title7 = Word on a Wing\n| note7 = live\n| length7 = 6:10\n| title8 = Stay\n| note8 = live\n| length8 = 7:24\n|total_length=51:23\n}}\n\n===2010 reissues===\nA special edition and deluxe edition of the album were released in 2010, including the entire 1976 Nassau Coliseum show on two CDs (on both versions) and a [[Dolby 5.1]] mix of the album (on the deluxe edition).<ref name=\"test\">[http://pitchfork.com/news/36213-david-bowies-ispace-oddityi-istation-to-stationi-albums-to-be-reissued/ David Bowie's Space Oddity, Station to Station Albums to Be Reissued] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822144244/http://pitchfork.com/news/36213-david-bowies-ispace-oddityi-istation-to-stationi-albums-to-be-reissued/ |date=22 August 2009 }}, [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork News]], Retrieved on 19 August 2009.</ref><ref name=\"BowieNet\">[http://www.davidbowie.com/news/index.php?id=20090811 Station to Station four disc set due next year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128191758/http://www.davidbowie.com/news/index.php?id=20090811 |date=28 January 2016 }} at [http://www.davidbowie.com/ BowieNet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018163535/http://www.davidbowie.com/ |date=18 October 1996 }}.

by English musician [[David Bowie]], released by [[RCA Records]] in 1976. Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, ''Station to Station'' was the vehicle for his performance persona, [[the Thin White Duke]]. The album was recorded after he completed shooting [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', and the [[cover art]]work featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially [[cocaine]], and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\">Buckley (2000): pp. 259, 264.</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nMusically, ''Station to Station'' was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the [[funk]] and [[soul music]] of his previous release, ''[[Young Americans]]'', while presenting a new direction influenced by German [[electronic music|electronic]] bands such as [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work with the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\", recorded with [[Brian Eno]] in 1977\u201379. Bowie himself said that ''Station to Station'' was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> The album's lyrics reflected his preoccupations with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Aleister Crowley]], mythology and religion.\n\nDrawing on funk and [[krautrock]], romantic balladry and [[occultism]], ''Station to Station'' has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Preceded by the single \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2012, the album was ranked No. 324 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based Bowie, fuelled by an \"astronomic\" cocaine habit and subsisting on a diet of [[Capsicum|peppers]] and milk, spent much of 1975\u201376 \"in a state of psychic terror\".<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\"/> Stories\u2014mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Rolling Stone''\u2014circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his [[semen]] stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from [[the Rolling Stones]], and living in morbid fear of fellow [[Aleister Crowley]] aficionado [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">Pegg (2004): pp. 297\u2013300.</ref> Bowie would later say of Los Angeles, \"The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite journal |last=McKinnon |first=Angus |title=The Future Isn't What It Used to Be |journal=[[NME]] |date=13 September 1980 |pages=32\u201335}}</ref>\n\nIt was on the set of his first major film, ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called ''The Return of the Thin White Duke''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=So Far Away.. |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=55}}</ref> He was also composing music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]] would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.)<ref>Phillips (1986): p. 290.</ref> Director [[Nicolas Roeg]] warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 260\u2013263.</ref>\n\nThe Thin White Duke became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often during the next six months, for Bowie himself. Impeccably dressed in white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat, the Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity, yet felt nothing\u2014\"ice masquerading as fire\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 78\u201380.</ref> The persona has been described as \"a mad aristocrat\",<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"an amoral zombie\",<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 258.</ref> and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Station to Station'' was recorded in late 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]], Los Angeles. In 1981, ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] surmised that it was cut\u2014\"in 10 days of feverish activity\"\u2014when Bowie decided that there was no hope of his producing a soundtrack for ''The Man Who Fell to Earth''.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> More recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months\u2014with the sessions beginning in late September<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Kevin Cann (2010).

[[Tony Visconti]], who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and co-producing ''[[David Live]]'' and ''Young Americans'', was not involved due to competing schedules.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 269\u2013270.</ref> However, the recording did cement the band line-up that would see Bowie through the rest of the decade, with bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] joining ''Young Americans'' drummer [[Dennis Davis]] and rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nThe recording process developed with this team set the pattern for Bowie's albums up to and including ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' in 1980: backing tracks laid down by Murray, Davis and Alomar; saxophone, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs (here by Bowie, [[Roy Bittan]] and [[Earl Slick]], respectively); lead vocals; and finally various production tricks to complete the song.<ref name=\"Buckley p.270\">Buckley (2000): p. 270.</ref> According to Bowie, \"I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick.

We experimented so much on it\".<ref name=\"Buckley p.270\"/> Maslin added, \"I loved those sessions because we were totally open and experimental in our approach\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nBowie himself remembered almost nothing of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, \"I know it was in LA because I've read it was\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> The singer was not alone in his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, \"if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke&nbsp;... the coke use is driven by the inspiration.\" Like Bowie, Earl Slick had somewhat vague memories of the recording: \"That album's a little fuzzy\u2014for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts\u2014a lot of hours, a lot of late nights.\"<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nThe sleeve front cover used a black-and-white still from ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, steps into the space capsule that will return him to his home planet.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssGT7x-jCTYC&pg=PA135 |title=Trajectories of the fantastic: selected essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts |author=Michael A.

[[Nicholas Pegg]], author of ''The Complete David Bowie'', called it a \"precise halfway point on the journey from ''[[Young Americans]]'' to ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it \"effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with ''Low''.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> In terms of Bowie's own output, ''Station to Station'''s Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like \"[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)]]\" and \"[[Time (David Bowie song)|Time]]\" (1973), while its [[funk]] and [[disco]] elements were a development of the [[soul music|soul]] sound of ''Young Americans'' (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of  [[krautrock]] and [[electronic music]] by bands like [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]].

Backed with \"Word on a Wing\" and accompanied by a video shot especially for the release, it made No. 24 in the UK and charted for ten weeks.<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 625.</ref>\n\nAnother song purportedly recorded during the album sessions at Cherokee Studios, a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City\",<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\"/> went unreleased at the time but was issued in 1989 on the ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound+Vision]]'' box set. Harry Maslin and Carlos Alomar have claimed that they never recorded the song during the Cherokee sessions, while Tony Visconti believes that the song most likely consisted of overdubs to a track originally cut at [[Olympic Studios|Olympic]] and [[Island Studios]] during the ''Diamond Dogs'' sessions, with [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums, [[Herbie Flowers]] on bass and [[Mike Garson]] on

On the Isolar Tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of [[Nazism|Nazi]] memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in [[Stockholm]] as saying that \"Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader\".<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 11.</ref> The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called '[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in ''[[NME]]''. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave,<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie 2\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=The Controversial Homecoming |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=64}}</ref> a contention backed by a young [[Gary Numan]] who was among the crowd that day: \"Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines \"To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading\" from ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''' opening track \"[[It's No Game]]\", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Station to Station'' was a milestone in Bowie's transition to his late 1970s '[[Berlin Trilogy]]'. Bowie himself has said of the album, \"As far as the music goes, ''Low'' and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie pp.205\u2013206\"/> while [[Brian Eno]] opined that ''Low'' was \"very much a continuation from ''Station to Station''\".<ref name=\"Low\">Wilcken (2005): p. 4.</ref> It has also been described as \"enormously influential on [[post-punk]]\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\"/> [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in 1981, \"If ''Low'' was [[Gary Numan]]'s Bowie album, then ''Station to Station'' was [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> However, ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' declared in 2004 that \"just as few had anticipated Bowie's approach, few copied it&nbsp;... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style\".<ref name=\"Stylus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |title=On Second Thought: David Bowie&nbsp;\u2013 Station to Station |author=Mathers, Ian |date=13 April 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66jBYukxy?url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] deemed it a \"[[space rock]] masterpiece\" in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), writing that Bowie had recorded \"the most intense music of his life\".<ref name=\"RS2004\"/> Jem Aswad of [[NPR]] described the album as \"pioneering ice-funk\" that \"paved the way not only for thousands of artists who were influenced by it, but also for the brilliant wave of experimentation that followed over the next five years: ''Low'', ''Heroes'', ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' and ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aswad|first1=Jem|title=Who Can I Be Now?

The album was released again in 1991 by [[Rykodisc]], with two, live bonus tracks;  a 1999 rerelease by [[EMI]] featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound, but lacks bonus tracks.  Both re-releases used a colour version of the cover art, wherein the photograph occupies the entirety of the front cover apart from the red \"STATIONTOSTATIONDAVIDBOWIE\" text on the top. This modified artwork would be standard for CD issues of the album until 2007, when EMI Japan reused the original black-and-white artwork on a mini-LP release. The album was re-released by EMI in Special and Deluxe Editions in 2010, both of which presented the album in a mini-LP replica sleeve, within a larger box.  The Deluxe Edition included stereo and surround sound remixes of the album by coproducer Harry Maslin.\n\nThe album was remastered again in 2016, for inclusion in the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set, with an individual CD release made available the following year. The box set includes both the original 1976 mix and the 2010 stereo remix of ''Station to Station'', individually packaged in mini LP sleeves. The 1976 mix uses the original cover art, while the 2010 mix uses a color-corrected version of the 1991 front cover art; the back cover of the 2010 mix's sleeve is a variant of the 1976 back cover, with burgundy text in place of bright red. The original cover art is also used for the 2017 standalone CD release of the album, which only includes the 1976 mix.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[David Bowie]], except where noted.\n{{tracklist\n|headline= Side one\n|title1 = [[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]\n|length1 = 10:15\n|title2 = [[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\n|length2 = 3:59\n|title3 = [[Word on a Wing]]\n|length3 = 6:04\n}}\n{{tracklist\n|headline= Side two\n|title1 = [[TVC 15]]\n|length1 = 5:31\n|title2 = [[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\n|length2 = 6:16\n|title3 = [[Wild Is the Wind (song)#David Bowie recording|Wild Is the Wind]]\n|lyrics3 = [[Ned Washington]]\n|music3 = [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]\n|length3 = 6:06\n|total_length = 37:57\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u20136 on CD reissues.\n\n{{tracklist\n|headline= 1991 reissue bonus tracks (recorded on 23 March 1976 at [[Nassau Coliseum]], [[Uniondale, New York]]<ref name=\"StS1990\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Station to Station |others=David Bowie |year=1991 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Rykodisc}}</ref>)\n| title7 = Word on a Wing\n| note7 = live\n| length7 = 6:10\n| title8 = Stay\n| note8 = live\n| length8 = 7:24\n|total_length=51:23\n}}\n\n===2010 reissues===\nA special edition and deluxe edition of the album were released in 2010, including the entire 1976 Nassau Coliseum show on two CDs (on both versions) and a [[Dolby 5.1]] mix of the album (on the deluxe edition).<ref name=\"test\">[http://pitchfork.com/news/36213-david-bowies-ispace-oddityi-istation-to-stationi-albums-to-be-reissued/ David Bowie's Space Oddity, Station to Station Albums to Be Reissued] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822144244/http://pitchfork.com/news/36213-david-bowies-ispace-oddityi-istation-to-stationi-albums-to-be-reissued/ |date=22 August 2009 }}, [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork News]], Retrieved on 19 August 2009.</ref><ref name=\"BowieNet\">[http://www.davidbowie.com/news/index.php?id=20090811 Station to Station four disc set due next year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128191758/http://www.davidbowie.com/news/index.php?id=20090811 |date=28 January 2016 }} at [http://www.davidbowie.com/ BowieNet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018163535/http://www.davidbowie.com/ |date=18 October 1996 }}.

It was Bowie's final studio album on the label and his first following the [[Berlin Trilogy]], which consisted of ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1977\u20131979). Though considered very significant in artistic terms, the trilogy had proven less successful commercially.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.302</ref> With ''Scary Monsters'', Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called \"the perfect balance\" of creativity and mainstream success.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). pp.363\u2013375</ref>\n\nUpon release, the album garnered critical acclaim and peaked at No. 1 and went Platinum in the UK while successfully restoring Bowie's commercial standing in the US.<ref>[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p.314</ref><ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.108\u2013114</ref> ''Scary Monsters'' would later be referred to by some biographers as Bowie's \"last great album\" and a benchmark for later releases. The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to co-producer [[Tony Visconti]], David Bowie's method on ''Scary Monsters'' was somewhat less experimental and more concerned with achieving a commercially viable sound than had been the case with his recent releases; to that end the composer spent more time on his own developing lyrics and melodies before recording, rather than improvising music in the studio and making up words at the last minute.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> Aside from one cover, [[Tom Verlaine]]'s \"Kingdom Come\", all tracks would be credited to Bowie alone, unlike the 'Berlin Trilogy' where there was an increasing amount of input from his collaborators.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nAmong those collaborators, [[Brian Eno]] was no longer present on ''Scary Monsters'', but [[Chuck Hammer]] added multiple textural layers deploying [[guitar synth]] and, following his absence from ''Lodger'', [[Robert Fripp]] returned with the distinctive guitar sound he had earlier lent to ''\"Heroes\"''. [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s pianist [[Roy Bittan]] was back for his first Bowie album since ''[[Station to Station]]'' five years earlier, while [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] guested on \"Because You're Young\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> This would be the fifth and last Bowie album featuring the rhythm section of [[Dennis Davis]], [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], which had been together since ''Station to Station''.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.270</ref>\n\n==Development==\nBowie continued to develop songs using non-traditional methods: for \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", he challenged guitarist Fripp to \"imagine he was playing a guitar duel with [[B.B. King]] where he had to out-B.B. B.B., but do it in his own way.\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97>Joe Gore, \"Changes 2.1\" , ''Guitar Player'' magazine, June 1997, pp. 45\u201358</ref>\n\n\"We were doing either 'Up the Hill Backwards' or 'It's No Game', and I said, 'Any suggestions?'\" Fripp recalled. \"And David replied, \"[[Ritchie Blackmore]]!\" Because David isn't really a guitarist, he couldn't give me more of a ground plan than that, but I knew what he meant.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Rob|last=Hughes|title=Prog? It's a prison|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|date=February 2015|p=73}}</ref>\n\n\"Fashion\" began as \"Jamaica\". Unable to think of anything to write, Bowie discarded the song until late in the recording cycle, when it was transformed into the song that appears on the album. Other tracks also began with different names: \"Ashes to Ashes\" as \"People Are Turning to Gold\", \"Teenage Wildlife\" as \"It Happens Everyday\" and \"Scream Like a Baby\" as \"Laser\" (the lyric \"Scream like a baby\" was sung as \"I am a laser\"). \"Laser\" was originally written in 1973, recorded by Ava Cherry and the Astronettes (made up of Bowie collaborators Ava Cherry and Geoff MacCormack), and [[demo (music)|demoed]] by Bowie during the sessions for \"[[Young Americans]]\" in 1975. \"Is There Life After Marriage?\" was fully written and recorded for the album, but, for unknown reasons, never released.<ref name=SIDC>{{citation |title=David Bowie: The Starzone Interviews |editor=David Currie |isbn=978-0-7119-0685-3 |location=England |year=1985 |publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref> This track is a rough instrumental demo cover of \"[[I Feel Free]]\" (by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]), which later appeared, rerecorded, on 1993's ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''.\n\n==Style and themes==\nThe public's first taste of ''Scary Monsters'' was \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", which was released as a single one month prior to the album and made No. 1 in the UK. Built around a guitar synth theme by [[Chuck Hammer]], it revisited the character of [[Major Tom]] from Bowie's early hit \"[[Space Oddity]]\". Aside from its critical and commercial success as a song, the accompanying music video set a benchmark for the art form.<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). p.29</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the lush textures of \"Ashes to Ashes\", Bowie's sound on the album was described by critics as being harsher\u2014and his worldview more desperate\u2014than anything he had released since ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> This was exemplified by such tracks as \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", the hard-rocking opener featuring lead female vocals in Japanese; the careering [[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (song)|title track]] with its prominent percussion effects and Bowie's [[cockney]] accent; the second single \"[[Fashion (David Bowie song)|Fashion]]\", which seemed to draw parallels between style and politics and which had its own highly regarded video;<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> and \"[[Scream Like a Baby]]\", a tale of [[political prisoner|political imprisonment]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nIn \"Teenage Wildlife\", against a musical backdrop that owed much to his song [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]], Bowie was variously thought to be taking aim squarely at [[New wave music|new wave]] artists such as [[Gary Numan]],<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> or reflecting on his younger self:<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\n:A broken-nosed mogul are you\n:One of the new wave boys\n:Same old thing in brand new [[drag (clothing)|drag]]\n:Comes sweeping into view\n:As ugly as a teenage millionaire\n:Pretending it's a whiz-kid world\n\n==Packaging==\n[[Image:ScaryMonstersBackCover.jpg|thumb|right|The rear sleeve contained references to four of Bowie's earlier albums.]]\n\nThe [[cover artwork]] of ''Scary Monsters'' is a large scale collage by [[Edward Bell (artist)|Edward Bell]] featuring Bowie in the [[Pierrot]] costume worn in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" music video, along with [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] photographs. The original [[Gramophone record|vinyl album]]'s rear sleeve referred to four earlier albums, namely the immediately preceding 'Berlin Trilogy' and 1973's ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the latter also having been designed and photographed by Duffy. The cover images from ''Low'', ''\"Heroes\"'', and ''Lodger''\u2014the last showing Bowie's torso superimposed on the figure from ''Aladdin Sane'''s inside gatefold picture\u2014were portrayed in small frames to the left of the track listing.

Retrieved 11 April 2013.</ref>\n\n==Singles and other songs==\nFollowing the release of \"Ashes to Ashes\" in August 1980, prior to the album, and \"Fashion\" in October, the title track was issued as a single in January 1981 in both [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] and [[compact cassette]] form. The album's final single, \"[[Up the Hill Backwards]]\", was released in March of that year. Other songs from this period, released on CD by Rykodisc, included both sides of the single \"[[Alabama Song (Bowie)|Alabama Song]]\" b/w \"Space Oddity\", the latter a stark remake that debuted New Year's Eve 1979 on ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' and served as a \"ritualistic purification\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> of Bowie's most famous number prior to its demolition with \"Ashes to Ashes\"; \"[[Crystal Japan]]\", B-side of \"Up the Hill Backwards\" in the UK and an A-side b/w \"Alabama Song\" in Japan, where it was also used for a [[Sake]] commercial;<ref

Equalled\", seen as a direct reference to the New Wave acts Bowie had inspired over the years.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> It was highly praised by critics, ''[[Record Mirror]]'' giving it a rating of seven stars out of five,<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> while ''[[Melody Maker]]'' called it \"an eerily impressive stride into the '80s\" and ''Billboard'' reported that it \"should be

It was Bowie's final studio album on the label and his first following the [[Berlin Trilogy]], which consisted of ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1977\u20131979). Though considered very significant in artistic terms, the trilogy had proven less successful commercially.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.302</ref> With ''Scary Monsters'', Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called \"the perfect balance\" of creativity and mainstream success.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). pp.363\u2013375</ref>\n\nUpon release, the album garnered critical acclaim and peaked at No. 1 and went Platinum in the UK while successfully restoring Bowie's commercial standing in the US.<ref>[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p.314</ref><ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.108\u2013114</ref> ''Scary Monsters'' would later be referred to by some biographers as Bowie's \"last great album\" and a benchmark for later releases. The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to co-producer [[Tony Visconti]], David Bowie's method on ''Scary Monsters'' was somewhat less experimental and more concerned with achieving a commercially viable sound than had been the case with his recent releases; to that end the composer spent more time on his own developing lyrics and melodies before recording, rather than improvising music in the studio and making up words at the last minute.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> Aside from one cover, [[Tom Verlaine]]'s \"Kingdom Come\", all tracks would be credited to Bowie alone, unlike the 'Berlin Trilogy' where there was an increasing amount of input from his collaborators.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nAmong those collaborators, [[Brian Eno]] was no longer present on ''Scary Monsters'', but [[Chuck Hammer]] added multiple textural layers deploying [[guitar synth]] and, following his absence from ''Lodger'', [[Robert Fripp]] returned with the distinctive guitar sound he had earlier lent to ''\"Heroes\"''. [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s pianist [[Roy Bittan]] was back for his first Bowie album since ''[[Station to Station]]'' five years earlier, while [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] guested on \"Because You're Young\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> This would be the fifth and last Bowie album featuring the rhythm section of [[Dennis Davis]], [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], which had been together since ''Station to Station''.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.270</ref>\n\n==Development==\nBowie continued to develop songs using non-traditional methods: for \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", he challenged guitarist Fripp to \"imagine he was playing a guitar duel with [[B.B. King]] where he had to out-B.B. B.B., but do it in his own way.\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97>Joe Gore, \"Changes 2.1\" , ''Guitar Player'' magazine, June 1997, pp. 45\u201358</ref>\n\n\"We were doing either 'Up the Hill Backwards' or 'It's No Game', and I said, 'Any suggestions?'\" Fripp recalled. \"And David replied, \"[[Ritchie Blackmore]]!\" Because David isn't really a guitarist, he couldn't give me more of a ground plan than that, but I knew what he meant.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Rob|last=Hughes|title=Prog? It's a prison|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|date=February 2015|p=73}}</ref>\n\n\"Fashion\" began as \"Jamaica\". Unable to think of anything to write, Bowie discarded the song until late in the recording cycle, when it was transformed into the song that appears on the album. Other tracks also began with different names: \"Ashes to Ashes\" as \"People Are Turning to Gold\", \"Teenage Wildlife\" as \"It Happens Everyday\" and \"Scream Like a Baby\" as \"Laser\" (the lyric \"Scream like a baby\" was sung as \"I am a laser\"). \"Laser\" was originally written in 1973, recorded by Ava Cherry and the Astronettes (made up of Bowie collaborators Ava Cherry and Geoff MacCormack), and [[demo (music)|demoed]] by Bowie during the sessions for \"[[Young Americans]]\" in 1975. \"Is There Life After Marriage?\" was fully written and recorded for the album, but, for unknown reasons, never released.<ref name=SIDC>{{citation |title=David Bowie: The Starzone Interviews |editor=David Currie |isbn=978-0-7119-0685-3 |location=England |year=1985 |publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref> This track is a rough instrumental demo cover of \"[[I Feel Free]]\" (by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]), which later appeared, rerecorded, on 1993's ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''.\n\n==Style and themes==\nThe public's first taste of ''Scary Monsters'' was \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", which was released as a single one month prior to the album and made No. 1 in the UK. Built around a guitar synth theme by [[Chuck Hammer]], it revisited the character of [[Major Tom]] from Bowie's early hit \"[[Space Oddity]]\". Aside from its critical and commercial success as a song, the accompanying music video set a benchmark for the art form.<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). p.29</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the lush textures of \"Ashes to Ashes\", Bowie's sound on the album was described by critics as being harsher\u2014and his worldview more desperate\u2014than anything he had released since ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> This was exemplified by such tracks as \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", the hard-rocking opener featuring lead female vocals in Japanese; the careering [[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (song)|title track]] with its prominent percussion effects and Bowie's [[cockney]] accent; the second single \"[[Fashion (David Bowie song)|Fashion]]\", which seemed to draw parallels between style and politics and which had its own highly regarded video;<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> and \"[[Scream Like a Baby]]\", a tale of [[political prisoner|political imprisonment]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nIn \"Teenage Wildlife\", against a musical backdrop that owed much to his song [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]], Bowie was variously thought to be taking aim squarely at [[New wave music|new wave]] artists such as [[Gary Numan]],<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> or reflecting on his younger self:<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\n:A broken-nosed mogul are you\n:One of the new wave boys\n:Same old thing in brand new [[drag (clothing)|drag]]\n:Comes sweeping into view\n:As ugly as a teenage millionaire\n:Pretending it's a whiz-kid world\n\n==Packaging==\n[[Image:ScaryMonstersBackCover.jpg|thumb|right|The rear sleeve contained references to four of Bowie's earlier albums.]]\n\nThe [[cover artwork]] of ''Scary Monsters'' is a large scale collage by [[Edward Bell (artist)|Edward Bell]] featuring Bowie in the [[Pierrot]] costume worn in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" music video, along with [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] photographs. The original [[Gramophone record|vinyl album]]'s rear sleeve referred to four earlier albums, namely the immediately preceding 'Berlin Trilogy' and 1973's ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the latter also having been designed and photographed by Duffy. The cover images from ''Low'', ''\"Heroes\"'', and ''Lodger''\u2014the last showing Bowie's torso superimposed on the figure from ''Aladdin Sane'''s inside gatefold picture\u2014were portrayed in small frames to the left of the track listing. Their [[whitewash]]ed brushstrokes was reportedly designed \"to symbolise the discarding of Bowie's old personae.\"<ref>[http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html ''Scary Monsters'' at BowieGoldenYears].

The album's final single, \"[[Up the Hill Backwards]]\", was released in March of that year. Other songs from this period, released on CD by Rykodisc, included both sides of the single \"[[Alabama Song (Bowie)|Alabama Song]]\" b/w \"Space Oddity\", the latter a stark remake that debuted New Year's Eve 1979 on ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' and served as a \"ritualistic purification\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> of Bowie's most famous number prior to its demolition with \"Ashes to Ashes\"; \"[[Crystal Japan]]\", B-side of \"Up the Hill Backwards\" in the UK and an A-side b/w \"Alabama Song\" in Japan, where it was also used for a [[Sake]] commercial;<ref

It was originally released in May 1979 by [[RCA Records]]. The third and final release of the [[Berlin Trilogy]], following ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (both 1977), it was recorded in Switzerland and [[New York City]] with collaborator [[Brian Eno]] and producer [[Tony Visconti]]. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, ''Lodger'' contained no instrumentals and a somewhat more pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of [[world music]] and recording techniques inspired by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\"/>\n\nThe album was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered to be among Bowie's most underrated albums.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.335\u2013356</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.310\u2013312</ref> It was accompanied by several singles, including the UK Top 10 hit \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\".\n\nIt is one of Bowie's most influential works, particularly to the 1990s [[Britpop]] movement, with two major Britpop bands, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who named their 1996 number-one hit \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" after ''Lodger'''s \"[[Look Back in Anger (song)|Look Back in Anger]]\" and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], who used the same chord sequence as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" and \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" in their 1997 hit single \"[[M.O.R.]]\". The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Recording and production==\nOriginally to be titled either ''Planned Accidents'' or ''Despite Straight Lines'',<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> ''Lodger'' was largely recorded between legs of David Bowie's [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] and featured the same musicians, along with [[Brian Eno]]. The recording sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilize techniques from Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's Lodger Comes In From The Cold \u2013 Ben Graham, January 11th, 2016 00:35|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Experiments on the album included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians play unfamiliar instruments (as on \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\").<ref name=\"Q\"/> Lead guitar was played not by [[Robert Fripp]], as on ''\"Heroes\"'', but by Fripp's future [[King Crimson]] band member, [[Adrian Belew]], whom Bowie had \"poached\" while the guitarist was touring with [[Frank Zappa]]. Much of Belew's work on the album was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\nEno felt that the trilogy had \"petered out\" by ''Lodger'',<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">Ian Gittins (2007). \"Art Decade\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.70\u201373</ref> and Belew also observed Eno's and Bowie's working relationship closing down: \"They didn't quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn't seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the ''\"Heroes\"'' album.\"<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough missing the songs/instrumentals split that characterised ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', ''Lodger'' has been interpreted as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.102\u2013107</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\">Nicholas Pegg (2000).

It was originally released in May 1979 by [[RCA Records]]. The third and final release of the [[Berlin Trilogy]], following ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (both 1977), it was recorded in Switzerland and [[New York City]] with collaborator [[Brian Eno]] and producer [[Tony Visconti]]. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, ''Lodger'' contained no instrumentals and a somewhat more pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of [[world music]] and recording techniques inspired by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\"/>\n\nThe album was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered to be among Bowie's most underrated albums.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.335\u2013356</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.310\u2013312</ref> It was accompanied by several singles, including the UK Top 10 hit \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\".\n\nIt is one of Bowie's most influential works, particularly to the 1990s [[Britpop]] movement, with two major Britpop bands, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who named their 1996 number-one hit \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" after ''Lodger'''s \"[[Look Back in Anger (song)|Look Back in Anger]]\" and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], who used the same chord sequence as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" and \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" in their 1997 hit single \"[[M.O.R.]]\". The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Recording and production==\nOriginally to be titled either ''Planned Accidents'' or ''Despite Straight Lines'',<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> ''Lodger'' was largely recorded between legs of David Bowie's [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] and featured the same musicians, along with [[Brian Eno]]. The recording sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilize techniques from Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's Lodger Comes In From The Cold \u2013 Ben Graham, January 11th, 2016 00:35|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Experiments on the album included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians play unfamiliar instruments (as on \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\").<ref name=\"Q\"/> Lead guitar was played not by [[Robert Fripp]], as on ''\"Heroes\"'', but by Fripp's future [[King Crimson]] band member, [[Adrian Belew]], whom Bowie had \"poached\" while the guitarist was touring with [[Frank Zappa]]. Much of Belew's work on the album was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\nEno felt that the trilogy had \"petered out\" by ''Lodger'',<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">Ian Gittins (2007). \"Art Decade\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.70\u201373</ref> and Belew also observed Eno's and Bowie's working relationship closing down: \"They didn't quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn't seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the ''\"Heroes\"'' album.\"<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough missing the songs/instrumentals split that characterised ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', ''Lodger'' has been interpreted as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.102\u2013107</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\">Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: pp.172\u2013173</ref> The final track on ''\"Heroes\"'', \"[[The Secret Life of Arabia]]\", anticipated the mock-exotic feel of ''Lodger''{{'}}s travel songs. \"African Night Flight\" was a tribute to the music and culture of the [[veld]], inspired by a trip to [[Kenya]] that he took with his then-small son [[Duncan Jones|Zowie]];<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': pp.177\u2013191</ref> its musical textures have been cited as presaging the popularity of [[world music]], Bowie considering it a forerunner of the sounds developed by Brian Eno and [[David Byrne]] for ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/><ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/> \"Move On\" was lyrically Bowie's ode to his own wanderlust, sonically his earlier classic \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" played backwards.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"[[Yassassin]]\" was an unlikely [[reggae]] song with a [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] flavour. \"Red Sails\" was inspired in part by the music of German band [[Neu!]], sharing Neu!'s distinctive \"[[motorik]]\" drum beat;<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\"/> for Bowie, it combined \"a German new music feel\" with \"a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling [[Errol Flynn]]\" to produce \"a lovely cross-reference of cultures\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> \"Red Sails\" has also be compared with [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia's]] 1975 track \"Monza (Rauf und Runter)\".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/?s=red+sails |title= Pushing Ahead of the Dame |author= col1234 |accessdate= 11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOf the album's critiques, \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\", the first single, was seen by ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] partly as a witty riposte to the [[Village People]] but also, combined with its cross-dressing video clip, a comment on ideas of masculinity; musically it was notable for guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]] and drummer [[Dennis Davis]] in the unfamiliar roles of drummer and bass player, respectively.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> According to [[Tony Visconti]], the song featured the \"exact same chord changes and structure, even the same key\" as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\", Bowie's take on the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: p.74</ref> The second single, \"[[DJ (David Bowie song)|DJ]]\", took a sardonic look at the world of the disc jockey. \"Repetition\", Bowie's exploration of the mind of an [[domestic violence|abusive partner]], was sung in a deliberately unemotional tone that highlighted the lyric and the unnatural slur of the bass guitar.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"Red Money\" added new words to a Bowie/Alomar tune that had originally appeared as \"Sister Midnight\", with lyrics by Bowie and [[Iggy Pop]], on the latter's album ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]''.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\n==Packaging==\nBowie collaborated with English pop artist [[Derek Boshier]] on the [[cover art|cover design]]. The original gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot of Bowie by photographer [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] as an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose. For effect, the image was deliberately of low resolution, taken with a [[Polaroid SX-70|Polaroid SX-70 type camera]]. The inside of the gatefold included pictures of [[Che Guevara]]'s corpse, [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation of Christ]]'' and Bowie being readied for the cover photo.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/><ref>[http://www.derekboshier.com/gate/pages/bowie.html Derek Boshier Web Site]</ref> These images were not reproduced in the [[Rykodisc]] CD reissue in 1991.\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Lodger \u2013 David Bowie|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lodger-mw0000251982|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n| rev2       = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie Part 1: The 1960s and '70s|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006}}</ref>\n| rev3       = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3Score  = {{Rating|2.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled On Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n| rev4       = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score  = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev5       = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev5score  = B+<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ira|title=Lodger|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1991/11/01/lodger|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1 November 1991|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n| rev6       = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score  = 8.5/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Mike|title=David Bowie: Lodger|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21476-lodger/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n| rev7       = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Lodger|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=61|date=October 1991}}</ref>\n| rev8       = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=David Bowie|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n| rev9       = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84}}</ref>\n| rev10      = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv7-79.php|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=30 July 1979|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n''Lodger'' received relatively poor reviews on its original release, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling it \"one of his weakest&nbsp;... scattered, a footnote to ''\"Heroes\"'', an act of marking time\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Greil|authorlink=Greil Marcus|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/lodger-19790809|title=Lodger|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=9 August 1979|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' finding it \"slightly faceless\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> In ''[[Smash Hits]]'' the album was described as sounding like \"a ragbag of rejects from previous styles\" with \"only occasional flashes of genius\".<ref name=\"SmashHits\">{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Red|title=Albums|journal=[[Smash Hits]]|issue=31 May \u2013 13 June 1979|page=25}}</ref> It was also criticised for having a thinner, muddier mix than Bowie's previous albums.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] wrote favourably of the album in ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

The follow-up to his breakthrough ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', it was the first album he wrote and released from a position of stardom.<ref name=carrmurr1>{{cite book |title=David Bowie: An Illustrated Record |last=Carr |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Carr |author2=[[Charles Shaar Murray|Murray, Charles Shaar]] |year=1981 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-77966-8 |pages=52\u201356}}</ref> It was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. It was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London and RCA Studios in New York City between legs of the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]]. The album features a tougher and raunchier [[glam rock]] sound than its predecessor. The album cover featuring a lightning bolt across Bowie's face is regarded as one of his most iconic images.\n\nPreceded by the lead single \"[[The Jean Genie]]\", ''Aladdin Sane'' was Bowie's most commercially successful record up to that point, peaking at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 17 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album also received positive reviews from music critics, although many found it to be inferior to its predecessor. It has since been regarded by Bowie biographers as one of his essential albums. In 2003, the album was ranked among six Bowie entries on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]] (at No. 277), and No. 279 in a 2012 revised list. It was later ranked No. 77 on [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s. Songs from the album were performed frequently by Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust and [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2013 for its 40th anniversary, which was included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n== \"Ziggy goes to America\" ==\nThe name of the album is a pun on \"A Lad Insane\". An early variation was \"Love Aladdin Vein\", which David Bowie dropped partly because of its drug connotations.<ref name=pegg2>{{cite book |title=The Complete David Bowie |last=Pegg |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Pegg |year=2004 |origyear=2000 |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd |location=London |isbn=1-903111-73-0 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Although technically a new Bowie 'character', Aladdin Sane was essentially a development of [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] in his appearance and persona, as evidenced on the cover by [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] and in Bowie's live performances throughout 1973 that culminated in Ziggy's 'retirement' at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in July that year. Lacking the thematic flow found on its predecessor,<ref>[[Kris Needs]] (1983) ''Bowie: A Celebration'': p.29</ref> ''Aladdin Sane'' was described by Bowie himself as simply \"Ziggy goes to America\"; most of the tracks were observations he composed on the road during his [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], which accounted for the place names following each song title on the original record labels.<ref name=carrmurr1 /> Biographer Christopher Sandford believed the album showed that Bowie \"was simultaneously appalled and fixated by America\".<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': p.109</ref>\n\nHis mixed feelings about the journey stemmed, in Bowie's words, from \"wanting to be up on the stage performing my songs, but on the other hand not really wanting to be on those buses with all those strange people&nbsp;... So ''Aladdin Sane'' was split down the middle.\"<ref name=\"pegg2806\">Pegg, Nicholas (2006). The Complete David Bowie (4th ed.). London: Reynolds & Hearn Ltd. pp. 286. {{ISBN|1-905287-15-1}}.</ref> This kind of \"[[schizophrenia]]\", as Bowie described it, was conveyed on the cover by his makeup, where a lightning bolt represents the duality of mind, although he would later tell friends that the \"lad insane\" of the album's title track was inspired by his brother Terry, who had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic.<ref name=\"pegg2806\" /><ref>Pegg, 2006, pp.19 and 286.</ref><ref>[http://www.superseventies.com/ac27aladdinsane.html Seventies' Greatest Album Covers: Aladdin Sane] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720075243/http://www.superseventies.com/ac27aladdinsane.html |date=20 July 2011 }}.

Both numbers were dominated by [[Mike Garson]]'s acclaimed piano work,<ref name=buckstrange1 /> which also featured heavily in the faux [[James Bond]] flamenco ballad \"[[Lady Grinning Soul]]\", inspired by singer [[Claudia Lennear]].<ref name=carrmurr1 />\n\n== Singles ==\nTwo hit singles that would be included on the album preceded its release, \"[[The Jean Genie]]\" and \"[[Drive-In Saturday]]\".

The follow-up to his breakthrough ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', it was the first album he wrote and released from a position of stardom.<ref name=carrmurr1>{{cite book |title=David Bowie: An Illustrated Record |last=Carr |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Carr |author2=[[Charles Shaar Murray|Murray, Charles Shaar]] |year=1981 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-77966-8 |pages=52\u201356}}</ref> It was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. It was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London and RCA Studios in New York City between legs of the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]]. The album features a tougher and raunchier [[glam rock]] sound than its predecessor. The album cover featuring a lightning bolt across Bowie's face is regarded as one of his most iconic images.\n\nPreceded by the lead single \"[[The Jean Genie]]\", ''Aladdin Sane'' was Bowie's most commercially successful record up to that point, peaking at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 17 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album also received positive reviews from music critics, although many found it to be inferior to its predecessor. It has since been regarded by Bowie biographers as one of his essential albums. In 2003, the album was ranked among six Bowie entries on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]] (at No. 277), and No. 279 in a 2012 revised list. It was later ranked No. 77 on [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s. Songs from the album were performed frequently by Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust and [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2013 for its 40th anniversary, which was included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n== \"Ziggy goes to America\" ==\nThe name of the album is a pun on \"A Lad Insane\". An early variation was \"Love Aladdin Vein\", which David Bowie dropped partly because of its drug connotations.<ref name=pegg2>{{cite book |title=The Complete David Bowie |last=Pegg |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Pegg |year=2004 |origyear=2000 |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd |location=London |isbn=1-903111-73-0 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Although technically a new Bowie 'character', Aladdin Sane was essentially a development of [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] in his appearance and persona, as evidenced on the cover by [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] and in Bowie's live performances throughout 1973 that culminated in Ziggy's 'retirement' at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in July that year. Lacking the thematic flow found on its predecessor,<ref>[[Kris Needs]] (1983) ''Bowie: A Celebration'': p.29</ref> ''Aladdin Sane'' was described by Bowie himself as simply \"Ziggy goes to America\"; most of the tracks were observations he composed on the road during his [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], which accounted for the place names following each song title on the original record labels.<ref name=carrmurr1 /> Biographer Christopher Sandford believed the album showed that Bowie \"was simultaneously appalled and fixated by America\".<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': p.109</ref>\n\nHis mixed feelings about the journey stemmed, in Bowie's words, from \"wanting to be up on the stage performing my songs, but on the other hand not really wanting to be on those buses with all those strange people&nbsp;... So ''Aladdin Sane'' was split down the middle.\"<ref name=\"pegg2806\">Pegg, Nicholas (2006). The Complete David Bowie (4th ed.). London: Reynolds & Hearn Ltd. pp. 286. {{ISBN|1-905287-15-1}}.</ref> This kind of \"[[schizophrenia]]\", as Bowie described it, was conveyed on the cover by his makeup, where a lightning bolt represents the duality of mind, although he would later tell friends that the \"lad insane\" of the album's title track was inspired by his brother Terry, who had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic.<ref name=\"pegg2806\" /><ref>Pegg, 2006, pp.19 and 286.</ref><ref>[http://www.superseventies.com/ac27aladdinsane.html Seventies' Greatest Album Covers: Aladdin Sane] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720075243/http://www.superseventies.com/ac27aladdinsane.html |date=20 July 2011 }}.

Both numbers were dominated by [[Mike Garson]]'s acclaimed piano work,<ref name=buckstrange1 /> which also featured heavily in the faux [[James Bond]] flamenco ballad \"[[Lady Grinning Soul]]\", inspired by singer [[Claudia Lennear]].<ref name=carrmurr1 />\n\n== Singles ==\nTwo hit singles that would be included on the album preceded its release, \"[[The Jean Genie]]\" and \"[[Drive-In Saturday]]\".
