{"title_page": "List of fictional United States presidencies of historical figures (V\u2013Z)", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup|reason=Too much detail; needs to be resectioned by person|date=November 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n}}\n{{FictionalPotus}}\nThe following is a list of real or historical people who have been portrayed as [[President of the United States]] in fiction, although they did not hold the office in real life. This is done either as an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual US Presidents with a fictional presidency at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n==V==\n===[[Martin Van Buren]]===\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[For Want of a Nail (novel)|For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga]]'' by the business historian [[Robert Sobel]], '''Martin Van Buren''' was the leader of the Northern Confederation's Conservative Party in the 1820s and the 1830s and was the Governor of the Northern Confederation from 1825 to 1831. Unlike the Northern Confederation's Liberal Party, the Conservatives were poorly organized and had no basic political philosophy. Instead, they simply opposed Liberal policies. The Conservatives did have more popular support than the Liberals and they were able to gain a majority of seats on the Northern Confederation Council in the 1825 elections and Van Buren became governor. The Conservatives' manipulation of the banking system led to the Depression of 1829, which cost them their majority in the 1831 elections.\n\n===[[Clement Vallandigham]]===\n* In the alternate history novel \"By Force of Arms\" by Billy Bennett, '''Clement Vallandigham''' was elected President of the United States in the aftermath of the U.S. defeat in the [[American Civil War]]. His policy was one of appeasement towards the [[Confederate States of America]] in the hope of luring them back into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] by diplomacy. His strategy was a disaster in that [[Jefferson Davis]] took advantage of Vallandigham's perceived weakness by invading and annexing the southern half of the disputed [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]]/[[New Mexico Territory]]. In the aftermath Vallandigham was defeated in the next Presidential election by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].\n* Similar to the above, in [[Ward Moore]]'s novel \"[[Bring the Jubilee]]\", the Confederacy wins the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], wins its independence and imposes a humiliating peace on the rump United States, whereupon  '''Clement Vallandigham''' wins the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] with the electorate turning sharply against the Republicans, held responsible for the disaster. However, Vallandigham's Presidency is haunted by economic crisis and galloping inflation, due to the reparations imposed by the victorious Confederacy. The US would be permanently crippled by the post-war crisis and left a backward country, and future generations would hold Vallandigham  partially responsible.\n\n* In ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]], the invention of a functional [[analytical engine]] by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1824 results in the early arrival of the [[Information Age]] and the ascendancy of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as a [[world power]]. British interference in North America in order to prevent the rise of the United States as a global power results in its fragmentation into a rump United States, the Confederate States, the [[Republic of Texas|Texan Republic]], the [[Californian Republic]], the [[Manhattan]] Commune and a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-dominated 'terra nullius'. In 1855, '''Clement Vallandigham''' is mentioned as being the former Union president (meaning that he had to have left office by 1853 at the latest) and acting as an uninhibited drunkard during a private dinner in [[London]].\n\n===[[Arthur H. Vandenberg]]===\n* '''Arthur Vandenberg''' was president from 1941 to 1945 in the 1939 [[Robert A. Heinlein]] novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]''.\n\n===[[Jesse Ventura]]===\n* '''Jesse Ventura''' is shown fighting for re-election against [[Henry Kissinger]] in ''[[Killroy and Tina]]''.\n* He is seen in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episodes \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\" and \"[[All the Presidents' Heads]]\" in the Hall of Presidents in the New New York Head Museum, implying that he served as President of either the United States or of Earth before the year 3000.\n\n===[[Kurt Vonnegut]]===\n* '''Kurt Vonnegut''' is president of the United Socialist States of America in [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]]'s ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', serving as a parallel to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n==W==\n===[[George Wallace]]===\n* In Mona Clee's ''Branch Point'' (1996), '''George Wallace''' is elected president (with [[Curtis LeMay]] as his vice president) in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] after the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinations]] of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. In another alternate timeline in the same novel, '''George Wallace''' is elected as the 43rd President in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], succeeding [[Bill Clinton]]. The novel was published in January 1996, indicating that the author may have believed that Clinton would lose the 1996 election.\n* He served one term (1977\u20131981) in the 1975 movie ''[[Tunnel Vision (1976 film)|Tunnelvision]]'', and was succeeded by an African-American woman named Washington.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[11/22/63]]'' by [[Stephen King]], '''George Wallace''' was elected president in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. His predecessor was [[John F. Kennedy]]. Wallace escalated the [[Vietnam War]] into a [[nuclear war]] that precipitated numerous other atomic conflicts around the globe. The state of [[Maine]] seceded from the United States and was a [[Canada|Canadian]] province by 2011. On May 15, 1972, Wallace was assassinated by [[Arthur Bremer]]. He was succeeded by Vice President [[Curtis LeMay]], who was defeated by his Democratic opponent Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]] in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]].\n\n===[[Henry A. Wallace]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"News from the Front\" by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Henry Wallace''' was serving as vice president under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the time of the United States' entry into [[World War II]] on December 11, 1941, as he was in real life. From then onwards, Roosevelt faced harsh criticism from and strict scrutiny by the American press. The press attacked the Roosevelt administration for not being prepared for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, as well as bringing on the attack by ignorantly imposing an oil embargo on the [[Empire of Japan]]. As the war progressed, the press began to constantly second-guess the Roosevelt administration and to ponder the value of the war. Furthermore, the press revealed important American military secrets, questioning the morality of spying on the [[Axis powers]], decrying the poor state of American technology and giving away planned attacks days before there were to take place, leading to their failures. More importantly, the [[Battle of Midway]] (June 4\u20137, 1942) proved to be a complete disaster. During the first half of 1942, protests against the war began to appear throughout the country and a group of celebrities took it upon themselves to sale to Japan and [[Nazi Germany]] to offer peace. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] faced similar problems in his own country. Matters came to a head when Vice President Wallace broke with the administration and publicly attacked Roosevelt's honesty and competence. Calls for [[impeachment]] grew louder throughout the United States and, finally, Congress began the impeachment process in June 1942. Although the story ends while Roosevelt is still president, it is heavily implied that he will be [[Impeachment in the United States#Impeachment of a U.S. President|impeached]] and removed from office and that Wallace will succeed him as the 33rd President.\n* The [[GURPS Infinite Worlds]] game include the timeline known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Lenin-1|Lenin-1]]'' in which Roosevelt maintained  Wallace as his vice president when he was reelected in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]; consequently '''Henry Wallace''' became president on April 12, 1945, upon Roosevelt's death. His passive stance (and that of his successors) against the [[Soviet Union]] resulted in the steady expansion of [[Communism]] across the globe. By 1989, the isolated and malaise-stricken United States is essentially the sole remaining [[capitalism|capitalist]] country on the planet. Also resulting from Wallace becoming president in 1945 is the \"Hell World\" known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Hell Worlds|Lenin-2]]'' where nuclear war and unconstrained industry have combined to crash the [[biosphere]].\n* Wallace also played an unfortunate role in the history of another unpleasant [[GURPS Infinite Worlds|GURPS]] timeline, known as [[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Reich-5|Reich-5]]. In this timeline [[Giuseppe Zangara]] succeeded in assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1933. He was followed by [[John Nance Garner|Garner]], [[Charles Lindbergh|Lindbergh]] and then '''Henry Wallace''', who all proved unable to handle the [[Great Depression]] - finally leading to the far-right [[William Dudley Pelley]] being elected president in [[1948 United States presidential election|1944]], assuming dictatorial powers, and inviting the Nazis to conquer the US to help him against the pro-democracy resistance - ending with a totally Nazi-dominated world.\n* '''Wallace''' becomes president after World War II in the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' strip ''Hope:... for the Future'' by [[Guy Adams]], set in a [[film noir]] world where magic is real.\n\n===[[Earl Warren]]===\n* In the [[Colonization (series)|''Colonization'' series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Earl Warren''' served as President of the United States from 1961 to 1965. He was elected president in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and would be re-elected in a landslide over his Democratic opponent [[Hubert Humphrey]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. He was in office when the [[The Race (Worldwar)|Race]]'s Colonization Fleet arrived at Earth in 1962 and ordered a secret attack using [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missiles]] fired from a [[artificial satellite|satellite]] that destroyed a dozen of the Fleet's starships. President Warren concealed his role in the affair for several years but the information was ultimately leaked to the Race in 1965 by Sam Yeager through Shiplord Straha, despite Warren's best efforts to silence Yeager through draconian extralegal measures. Fleetlord Atvar threatened war with the United States. Having seen how quickly and easily the Race had defeated Germany in the short-lived Race-German of 1965, President Warren knew he must avoid a war at all costs. Atvar offered two other options: abandon all space exploration for the indefinite future or allow the Race to destroy an American city. Warren knew he that must choose one of the two lest his country be destroyed and he would not give up the space program, a sign of his country's might and technological prowess. Consequently, he surprised and disappointed Atvar by allowing him to destroy [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Warren then committed suicide in the Gray House, the presidential residence in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and was succeeded by his vice president, [[Harold Stassen]].\n\n===[[George Washington]]===\n* In a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the short story \"[[He Walked Around the Horses]]\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], '''General George Washington''' was killed in the [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Battle of Doylestown]] during the short-lived [[American Revolution|rebellion]] of the colonies in [[British North America]] in the 1770s. He died in the arms of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]]. A seemingly insane individual who claimed to be a British diplomat named [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] maintained that the American rebels were successful in their attempts to achieve independence and that Washington survived.\n* In the short story \"The Father of His Country\" by [[Jody Lynn Nye]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''George Washington''' ran against [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the [[1788-89 United States presidential election|first United States presidential election in 1789]]. In spite of the fact that Franklin was 83&nbsp;years old and was rumored to have fathered numerous illegitimate children while serving as [[United States Ambassador to France|ambassador to France]] from 1778 to 1785, he was elected by the [[1st United States Congress]] on April 6, 1789, in part due to reservations voiced by prominent members of Congress such as [[John Hancock]] and [[Charles Thomson]] regarding Washington. They were concerned that it would set a bad precedent for the first President to be a general. Furthermore, Franklin's supporters stressed that he was well liked and respected by foreign heads of state friendly to the United States, had been prominent in matters of diplomacy and government at home and abroad and had already proven that he had the best interests of the nation at heart. Franklin was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]] on April 30, 1789. Franklin's vice president was [[John Adams]] who had supported Washington in Congress, as had his second cousin [[Samuel Adams]]. During his tenure in office, President Franklin attempted to create a more democratic society and managed to live longer than he did in real life, serving until at least 1792.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], '''Colonel George Washington''' was part of a group of American colonists who met with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of the United Kingdom]] in the 1760s and were able to put in place an eleventh hour agreement with avoided [[American Revolution|revolution]]. Washington and the King were immortalized in a painting entitled ''The Two Georges'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], which came to symbolize the friendship between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[North American Union]]. In his later career as the [[Governor-general]] of the North American Union, Washington implemented a policy which halted the westward expansion of European settlement for some decades and gave a chance to certain [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes such as the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Cherokee]] to modernize and keep much of their lands. For that reasons, he greatly revered by Native Americans into the late 20th century. The Iroquois believed that he was the only white person to be admitted to their religion's version of [[Paradise]]. Conversely, he is considered a traitor by the nativist, separatist organization, the [[Sons of Liberty]]. He is also the namesake of the Province of Washington (analogous with Saskatchewan) and an NAU car marque.\n* In the short story \"Arnoldstown\" by [[Mitchell Cummings]], '''General George Washington''' died of [[pneumonia]] during the winter of 1777\u20131778, which led to the near disintegration of the [[Continental Army]]. [[Benedict Arnold]] eventually succeeded him as its commanding general, rebuilt the army and snatched victory from the jaws of near-certain defeat. After independence had been secured through the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), Arnold went on to be elected as the first President of the United States in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]]. He was the most revered of all the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] in later generations. The story's name is derived from the US capital in this timeline being [[Washington, D.C.|Arnoldstown, D.C.]] with his name also being commemorated in the state of [[Washington (state)|Arnoldia]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] and numerous other place-names.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''George Washington''' served as the first President from April 30, 1789, to March 4, 1797, as he was in real life. After the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862), U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as the most memorable of presidents, though only Roosevelt was viewed in an entirely positive light. As a young man, Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader. However, the general public did not always remembered kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the US suffered because of it \u2013 as did that of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the US occupation authorities in [[Canada]]). Nonetheless, the US rebuilt the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). The Confederates were themselves saddened of the monument being destroyed in the war as well, as they were fond of George Washington, too. In fact, before 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]. The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under Anthony Dresser, used Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan, \"We need a New Revolution\". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have \"sold out the South to the damnyankees\" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first and President of the United States second. [[Washington and Lee University|Washington University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[nuclear weapon|superbomb]], retained its name and the statue of Washington that stood in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] survived both Great Wars.\n* In [[Michael Flynn (writer)|Michael Flynn]]'s [[novella]] ''[[The Forest of Time]]'', in the late 1780's General '''George Washington''' took a personal interest in the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee Wars]] - i.e. the violent conflict between Pennamites from [[Pennsilvania]] and Yankees from [[Connecticut]], both of whom laid claim to the [[Wyoming Valley]] and sent rival groups of settlers to it. In a fatally misguided step, Washington placed a unit of the Virginia Militia, commanded by himself, as a neutral buffer between Pennamites and Yankees. This culminated with the Virginians being trapped and decimated in a crossfire, Washington himself being among those killed. When the news of  Washington's death reached [[Philadelphia]], where the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was just convening, [[Benjamin Franklin]] suffered a stroke and died, too. The convention broke up in consternation, and the [[Constitution of the United States]] was never adopted and a Federal Government never created. The loose structure of the [[Continental Congress]] eventually disintegrated, with the Thirteen Colonies going each its own way as full-fledged nation states - except that the Yankees of [[New England]] did create their own more narrow confederation. In this situation, Yankee settlers - backed by the rest of New England - held on to much of the Wyoming Valley, their conflict with Pennsilvania further escalating. Eventually, two mutually hostile nation states emerged, possessing fully equipped regular armies - hereditary enemies which habitually and repeatedly go to war with each other. Posterity remembered George Washington as a talented general who won what was remembered as ''The War Against the British''. However, that war itself was remembered only as a temporary and ephemeral alliance, whose participants later often went to war with each other. Washington having been a Virginian, most people in North America thought of him as a foreigner and people in Virginia's neighbors thought of him as having been from an enemy country. \n* In the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] novel [[The Probability Broach]] by [[L. Neil Smith]], the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] succeeds after [[Albert Gallatin]] intercedes to help the farmers rather than the fledgling United States government as he does in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a [[Second American Revolution]]. This eventually leads to the overthrowing and execution of '''George Washington''' by firing squad for [[treason]] in 1794 and the United States Government being reformed. This included the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] being declared null and void, a new caretaker government being organized with all taxes being repelled in 1795, and the [[Articles of Confederation]] being revised with a much emphasis on individual freedom in 1797. After the war, Gallatin would serve as the 2nd and 7th president from 1794 to 1812 and from 1836 to 1840 with his actions later starting a [[libertarian]] state known as the [[North American Confederacy]] in 1893. Despite this, Gallatin insisted that historians would still count George Washington as the first president.\n* In the novel ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], in which the United States lost the American Revolution, '''Washington''' was executed for treason. America remained under control of the [[British Empire]] well into the 20th century. Washington's descendant, a gifted engineer still living in the ancestral [[Mount Vernon]], undertakes the stupendous project of a tunnel under the Atlantic which would bind America closer than ever to Britain.\n* In the alternate history series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], '''George Washington''' is mentioned as \"Lord Potomac\", who served under the English crown during the alternate version of the [[American Revolution]]. However, he surrendered his army and was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] for treason.\n* In the story \"Paine's Paine\" by Margaret Klein, conspirators led by the turncoat [[Thomas Hickey (soldier)|Thomas Hickey]] managing to kidnap '''George Washington''' in 1776 and deliver him to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commander, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]. Transported by a British warship, Washington was taken to the [[Tower of London]], to await trial on charges of [[High treason]]. However, the revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] secretly traveled to [[England]] and with the help of British radicals effected a dramatic prison break. Paine and the freed Washington boarded a ship captained by [[John Paul Jones]], which eluded the [[Royal Navy]] and arrived triumphantly at [[Boston]]. Paine was venerated as a hero and appointed as Washington's second in command. Throughout the rest of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the two of them together led the American forces. There was, however, a fundamental difference between  Washington's conservatism and Paine's radical ideas, which came into the open once independence was achieved. Eventually, Washington and Paine became bitter political foes. Following the first presidential election in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]], Washington was elected President and Paine - Vice President, but there was increasing friction between them which culminated in a violent clash in August 1790. Washington was killed by a militia supporting Paine. He himself denied responsibility and expressed \"great regret\" at Washington's death. In the aftermath, Paine assumed the Presidency but was regarded as an illegal usurper by a considerable part of the American public and initially sought to mollify his opponents and reach a compromise, but in vain. After surviving three assassination attempts and facing several armed insurrections, Paine saw no alternative but resorting to increasingly harsh measures against his opponents. These tarnished his reputation and earned him the nickname \"The American [[Robespierre]]\". In the face of mounting opposition, Paine tried to rally his followers, including radical intellectuals and working-class crowds, around a program of thorough social and political reform. He had some successes but was assassinated in November 1792, after issuing a Proclamation for Emancipation of the Slaves which he did not live to implement. After Paine's death, there was a sharp conservative backlash, Paine's main supporters being arrested or fleeing to exile in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] [[French First Republic|France]]. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], recalled into Emergency Session, elected [[Alexander Hamilton]] as president. Hamilton swiftly proceeded to annul Paine's reforms and was re-elected president in 1793. Thomas Paine remained one of the most controversial figures in American history, some venerating him as a great hero and martyr while others regarded him as the most black of villains. At every crisis point in American history over the next centuries, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Gulf War]], Paine's name and heritage were inevitably evoked yet again. \n* In the story \"Under the Dark Cloud\" by Abigail Stanton Wade, a fierce hurricane broke out during the [[Battle of Long Island]], scattering the [[Royal Navy]] ships and drowning many of them, with devastating losses for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. Also many of the British troops on land were decimated by the storm, their commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] being crush to death by a falling tree - while American troops escaped virtually unscathed. This outcome, coming at the very moment when the American Revolutionary cause seemed on the verge of losing [[New York City]] to the British, was widely perceived as an act of Divine Providence. During a mass Thanksgiving ceremony at the New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], a preacher referred to '''George Washington''' as \"God's [[Anointed]]\" - a usage which was soon taken up by others. With Washington winning several more notable victories against the British, a growing number of people started to seriously regard him as \"God's Chosen\", entrusted with \"a Divine Mission\". Washington cultivated  this phenomenon for political purposes - but in the following years he seemed to start believing in it himself. The Washington [[cult of personality]] reached its peak when he brought the war to a successful conclusion in January 1779 - forcing the British to recognize American independence. The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], held at 1782 in New York, was dominated by Washington and his supporters. The Constitution adopted provided for a President elected for life (and there was little doubt who it would be), a [[United States Senate|Senate]] whose members would likewise sit for life, and a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] elected by limited franchise. The \"Washington Constitution\" alienated many Democrats who withdrew in protest when the Convention failed to include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. [[Gouverneur Morris]], originally a friend and staunch supporter of George Washington, was repelled by what he perceived as Washington's increasing authoritarianism, arrogance and intolerance towards anyone who opposed him. Morris sought to promote a compromise between Washington and his opponents - but in vain. Soon after Washington assumed the Life Presidency, an armed rebellion broke out - which at Washington's order was put down with considerable brutality. Washington's opponents were driven underground - but after half a year, three of them managed to assassinate Washington. Thereupon, the United States was plunged into a full-scale [[American Civil War|civil war]]. This was exacerbated by the British reneging on the agreement, launching a large-scale invasion of the US and attempting to put in place a puppet President. Forces loyal to [[Thomas Jefferson]] succeeded in repulsing the British invasion and breaking up the last of the die-hard Washingtonians - but Jefferson was himself killed in the last battle. In the aftermath, Gouverneur Morris came to the fore in the efforts to achieve reconciliation - specifically, in convening a new Constitutional Convention. The Washington Constitution was scrapped. The new Constitution, much of it drafted by Morris, provided for a President elected for a single six-year term and ineligible for re-election, an elected Senate except for five Life Senators, and a Bill of Rights comprising thirteen articles. The new Constitution gained wide support and Gouverneur Morris was elected President by a large majority. He considered the furthering of reconciliation as his main task, and got nicknamed \"The Great Healer\". After his death, Congress bestowed upon him the title \"Father of His Country\" and resolved to count him as having been First President of the United States - the Washington Years being dismissed as \"an interregnum\".\n*In the novel ''Washington's Dirigible'' (part of the ''[[John Barnes (author)#Timeline Wars series| The Timeline Wars series]]'' by [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]), a colossal war is raging across countless [[alternate history]] timelines, between a progressive timeline originating from a surviving [[Fifth-century Athens| Periclean Athens]] and an extremely oppressive slave society resulting from a [[Ancient Carthage |Carthaginian]] victory over Rome. The Athenians send an agent to the 18th Century who creates a new timeline by getting [[Benjamin Franklin]] appointed as the tutor of the young King [[George III]], resulting in making him a Liberal King, sympathetic to the aspirations of the North American colonists; also, many technologies and devices are introduced into the 18th Century, such as railways, dirigibles, radio and electricity (as well as flush toilets). However, the Carthaginian \"Closers\" intervene, kidnapping the King and replace him by an authoritarian impostor. '''George Washington''' becomes aware of the situation and takes a major part in the struggle to save the rightful King George III and restore him to the throne, eventually setting the world back on the route to a progressive and forward-looking British Empire. Finding out that the Carthaginian \"Closers\" had plotted to make everybody in the world into slaves, regardless of skin color, makes Washington into an opponent of slavery and he emancipates his own Black slaves and hires them as free servants. Seeing things going well in his own world and no need to create the United States, Washington becomes a full time agent of the Athenians, undertaking dangerous missions at various alternate history timelines. Instead of becoming \"Father of His Country\", George Washington becomes the \"father\" of various countries in various histories which he helped free from the oppression of the \"Closers\".\n\n===[[Daniel Webster]]===\n* In George Field's story \"Daniel Webster's Road to the Devil\", '''Daniel Webster''' avoids the accident which in actual history caused his death, and is elected president in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] over [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Vowing to \"Preserve the Union at all costs\" by strictly enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]], Webster attempts to crush the [[Underground Railroad]] by setting up a network of spies and organizing extensive raids by Federal troops. One of these, at a farm in [[Massachusetts]], develops into a large-scale firefight, leading to the death of dozens of Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] as well as escaped slaves. This precipitates secessionist agitation in [[New England]]. President Webster, setting out to reason with the Massachusetts Legislature, is ambushed by abolitionists on his way to [[Boston]] and assassinated along with his Vice President, leaving the presidential succession doubtful and hotly disputed. The New England states go ahead with formally declaring all fugitive slaves welcome in their territory \u2013 which causes the South to secede in turn. The US plunges into a confused three-way [[American Civil War|civil war]] \u2013 exacerbated by large-scale [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] riots, attacks on [[Irish American]]s and the burning of Catholic churches, which prompts the Irish to form militias and embark on violent retaliations. In the confusion, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his radical Abolitionists succeed in seizing several arsenals, arming a large number of slaves and setting off several major [[slave rebellion]]s. After eleven years of total chaos, with widespread destruction and bloodshed throughout the country and no less than nine competing presidents setting themselves up at various locations, American leaders in 1864 appeal to [[Queen Victoria]] to help restore order. The war-weary population mostly welcomes the arrival of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is annulled and the former US territories are united with [[Canada]] into the [[British Dominion|Dominion]] of \"[[British North America]]\".\n\n===[[Adam Weishaupt]]===\n* '''Adam Weishaupt''' is the first President in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], after murdering and taking the identity of [[George Washington]].\n* Also ''The Secret Benefactor'' by Barbara Norden posits that '''Adam Weishaupt''' killed [[George Washington]] and took his identity. However, as presented by Norden this was a well intentioned act, since the original Washington had planned to subvert the Constitution, suspend the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and establish a hereditary monarchy, and only due to Weishaupt was American democracy maintained. Later on, in 1861 Weishaupt killed [[Abraham Lincoln]] and took his identity, since the original Lincoln did not intend to abolish slavery but was going to defeat the South and keep slavery intact - which would have led to a [[Second American Civil War|second and much worse Civil War]] twenty years later. A century later Weishaupt found it necessary to do it a third time, in 1961 killing [[John Kennedy]] and taking his identity - since the real Kennedy would have started a [[Third World War]] over the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and killed most of Humanity. During [[WWII]], Weishaupt thought [[Franklin Roosevelt ]] was doing a good job and there was no need to interfere with him, and therefore Weishaupt turned his talents in the opposite direction - killing [[Adolf Hitler]] and taking his place and as Hitler making a series of deliberate very bad decisions which greatly damaged Nazi Germany's war effort. In between, Weishaupt intentionally published a series of writings depicting himself and the Illuminati as evil schemers, in order to distract attention from what he was really doing. The book is written as a first-person narrative set down in 1997 by Weishaupt - extremely long-lived, but not an immortal - as he lay dying of old age at a secret Illuminati hideout in the Himalayas. Having found a worthy successor, who proved herself by acting behind the scenes to ensure a peaceful end to the Cold War and personally overseeing the breaking down of the [[Berlin Wall]], Weishaupt charges her - or her own successors - with publishing his book \"when the world is ready for it\", but cautioning \"This account is incomplete. The secret of some of the things I had to do had best die with me\".\n\n===[[Kanye West]]===\n* In the song \"Black Friday\" by [[Kendrick Lamar]], Lamar envisions a future where West becomes president. Under West's presidency, Kendrick would be allowed to receive oral sex in the [[Oval Office]] and play West's debut album ''[[The College Dropout]]'' inside of the White House.\n\n===[[Burton K. Wheeler]]===\n* In the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' by [[Philip Roth]], '''Burton Wheeler''' succeeded [[Charles Lindbergh]] as the 33rd President in 1942. Wheeler was Lindbergh's vice president in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], elected on an Isolationist ticket. Following Lindbergh's disappearance, he serves as President for eight days, a period marked by martial law and anti-Semitic rioting. Wheeler is eventually impeached but ultimately pardoned by Franklin Roosevelt (elected in an emergency presidential election concurrent with the 1942 midterm elections).\n* In ''[[The Divide (novel)|The Divide]]'' by [[William Overgard]], '''Burton Wheeler''', running as the Isolationist Party candidate, defeats President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] on a pledge to keep America out of war after the Nazis force the surrender of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. After [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] has overrun all of Russia, both Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] attack and invade the United States in 1941. President Wheeler surrenders the United States to the Axis after a devastating bombardment of missiles from occupied Canada. The surrender takes place on April 20, 1948, Adolf Hitler's fifty ninth birthday. President Wheeler, Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]], and other U.S. Government officials are executed by garrote in a meat packing plant outside of Washington D.C. after being found guilty of war crimes. Wheeler does leave behind a secret installation where work of producing an atomic bomb continues, in the hope that it would eventually help in liberating the country.\n* In the short story \"Fighting Bob\" by [[Kristine Kathryn Rusch]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] won the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 election]] with '''Burton Wheeler''' as his [[running mate]]. La Follette was the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] candidate, defeating the Republican incumbent [[Calvin Coolidge]] and their Democratic opponent [[John W. Davis]]. He entered office as the 31st President on March 4, 1925. However, President La Follette's term in office proved to be short-lived as he died on June 18, 1925 (as he did in real life). Wheeler succeeded him as the 32nd President.\n\n===[[Hugh Lawson White]]===\n* In Burt F. Dealon's Alternative History novelette ''Liberate the Earth!'', the Reptile extraterrestrials of the Xiupograzixt Empire secretly intervened in the [[1836 United States presidential election]] to unite the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] around the candidature of '''Hugh Lawson White''' and get him elected President, in the correct expectation that his insistence on limiting the power of the Federal government would weaken the US. This was part of various acts in other countries, such as assassinating [[Queen Victoria]] and having a weak and unpopular king (her uncle [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]]) take the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] Throne in her place, overthrowing [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis Philippe]] and plunging [[July Monarchy|France]] into a devastating civil war, instigating a civil war in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as well, fabricating sexual scandals to discredit the [[Habsburg]] Monarchy and starting a split in the [[Catholic Church]]. All of these provocations helped \"soften up\" Humanity towards the open Xiupograzixt takeover in 1841, with Reptile warriors armed with energy weapons suddenly landing in all important world capitals. President White uncovers a human traitor in the Reptile service who had infiltrated his administration and served as a senior aide, and discovers to his chagrin that he had been unknowingly the Reptiles' dupe all along his Presidency. The President orders the traitor executed and himself stages a hopeless last stand in the [[White House]], with a few remnants of the [[United States Army|US Army]] who had sworn to die at the President's side. As Earth becomes a minor Xiupograzixt province, with humans reduced to little more than expandable slaves for the Reptiles, Americans - and humans in other continents as well - secretly cherish the memory of President White as a great hero and martyr. When the Earth is finally liberated from Xiupograzixt oppression in the Liberation War of 1976, Revolutionary leaders inaugurate an monument for the heroic Last President at the site of the destroyed White House.\n\n===[[Harrison A. Williams]]===\n* '''Harrison Williams''' was a President in the 1960s in the timeline of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s \"[[Double Star]]\". Not much information is given, as this is an event of the distant past for the book's protagonists. In 1956, when Heinlein wrote the book, Williams was a rising young politician, recently elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 34, and the idea of his finally achieving the Presidency was a reasonable conjecture.\n\n===[[Wendell Willkie]]===\n* '''Wendell Willkie''' was elected president in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] (when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] decided to not seek a third term) in the [[S. M. Stirling]] novel ''[[Marching Through Georgia (novel)|Marching Through Georgia]]''. He led the United States into involvement in [[World War II]]. His vice president was [[Charles L. McNary]].\n\n===[[Woodrow Wilson]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"The Bull Moose at Bay\" by [[Mike Resnick]] contained in his anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'', Roosevelt was the subject of an assassination attempt carried out by [[John Flammang Schrank]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on October 14, 1912, as he was in reality. Whereas he was shot in the chest on that occasion in real life, Schrank's bullet missed him in the story. Running as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate, Roosevelt went on to defeat both '''Woodrow Wilson''' and the extremely unpopular incumbent Republican President [[William Howard Taft]] in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]]. Shortly after the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking of the passenger liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] by the German [[U-boat]] ''[[SM U-20 (Germany)|U-20]]'' on May 7, 1915, President Roosevelt brought the [[American entry into World War I|United States into the Great War]], resulting in the defeat of the [[German Empire]] by the [[Allies of World War I|US and its allies]] within less than a year. This made the United States a world power. In spite of this and the fact that the economy was experiencing a boom, Roosevelt was widely expected to lose the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]] to Wilson. Although the story ends prior to the election, it is heavily implied that Wilson will indeed be elected and therefore take office as the 29th president on March 4, 1917.\n* In the short story \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" by [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]] contained in the anthology ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', '''Woodrow Wilson''' was defeated in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]] by former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate. Roosevelt became the last democratically elected President of the United States. Before he could take office, however, Roosevelt was assassinated in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on December 19, 1912, by the [[marksman|sharpshooter]] and [[Exhibition shooting|exhibition shooter]] [[Annie Oakley]] while attempting to break up a labor strike with the help of the [[Rough Riders]] at the Chicago [[Union Stockyards]]. Consequently, Vice President-elect [[Charles Foster Kane]], an extremely wealthy newspaper mogul, was inaugurated as the 28th President on March 4, 1913. During his presidency, Kane led the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption. President Kane rigged the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], defeating Wilson and the Republican candidate former president [[William Howard Taft]] as Roosevelt had done in 1912. By February 1917, Wilson had been assassinated and many believed that Kane's agents were responsible. Wilson came to be regarded as a martyr by those opposed to Kane's regime. The [[Socialist Party of America]], led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], gained considerable report among the disenfranchised populace and soon the unrest led to outright [[Second American Civil War]]. After the [[Winter Palace|storming of the White House]] by the Socialist faction on July 4, 1917, Kane was shot and killed by Oakley, as Roosevelt had been four and a half years earlier. This resulted in the establishment of the United Socialist States of America (USSA) with Debs as its first president.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''Woodrow Wilson''' served as the 9th [[President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916, serving the maximum one term prescribed by the [[Confederate States Constitution]], and led the country into the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). Following the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]'s [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914]], President Wilson affirmed the commitment of the [[Confederate States of America]] to the [[Triple Entente|Quadruple Entente]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[Russian Empire|Russia]], describing the conflict between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Serbia]] as a case of a smaller nation being oppressed by a larger one. In his speech rallying the nation to war, Wilson reminded the Confederate people of the crucial role which Britain and France had played in the CSA's achievement of independence during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) as well as their importance to its continued survival. He called upon the Confederate States to stand up against the \"tyrannical\" [[German Empire]] and the \"bitter\" United States, reminding the crowd of the \"dark path\" which the US had followed and that it was the CSA's duty to be a continuing force for freedom in the world by entering the war. By the middle of 1915, the Great War, expected to be over by the previous [[Christmas]], had settled into a bloody stalemate in both [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. With only a few months left before the CS presidential election, Wilson was a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]. Nevertheless, he continued to rally the Confederate States while at the same time campaigning for his vice president [[Gabriel Semmes]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] presidential candidate. By this time, certain quarters were of the opinion that Wilson had not prosecuted the war as vigorously as he could have. President Wilson left office on March 4, 1916, and was succeeded by Semmes as the 10th president. In September 1917, the Great War ended with the defeat of the Confederate States and its allies. Wilson lived the remainder of his life in relative obscurity. Following his death in 1924, he was buried in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and was remembered with a certain fondness by later generations in the CS.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[1920: America's Great War]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]], '''Woodrow Wilson''' is running for a third term in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] despite being bedridden. He has been praised for bringing peace to Europe as he acted as mediator for the Treaty of Princeton, and has since enacted strong [[Non-interventionism|isolationist policies]] in the U.S. and making budget cuts from the U.S. military, thinking that the world is finally at everlasting peace. However, the [[German Empire]] has greatly expanded its military influence almost unopposed across the world due to the reparations and military restrictions imposed on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente nations]], which lost [[World War I]] in 1914. German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] sees the United States as the only remaining nation that can threaten Germany, and has prepared a plan for war. By aiding the German-friendly [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]] forces of [[Venustiano Carranza]], Mexico's government is overthrown and becomes a German ally. [[Mexico]] is then to be used as a staging point to launch a joint German-Mexican surprise invasion into the [[Southwestern United States]] with the goal of the Germans to gain the vast natural resources the Empire needs while Mexico tries to re-annex [[Mexican Cession|territory lost to the United States]]. After it is found that Wilson has died in his sleep, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Thomas R. Marshall]] is next in the [[United States presidential line of succession|chain of succession]] but formally steps down for not wanting the responsibility, and thus [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] is sworn in instead. President Lansing is fully aware of the threat of invasion from Mexico and has the U.S. military desperately scramble a defense, but comes too little to late as the German Army crosses the [[Mexico-United States border|border]] into [[California]] and the [[Mexican Army]] crosses the [[Rio Grande]] into [[Texas]].\n\n===[[Oprah Winfrey]]===\n* She is referenced as being President in 2030 in an episode of the short-lived science-fiction lawyer show ''[[Century City (television)|Century City]]''\n* She is elected president in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] in an alternate history episode of ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' called [[Return of the King (Boondocks episode)|Return of the King]] around the same time [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (who survived his [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination attempt in 1968]]) died in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] at the age of 91.\n\n===[[Ed Wood]]===\n* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the ''[[Sliders]]'' Season Two premiere \"Into the Mystic\" in which the United States was ruled by a commercial empire run by a mysterious sorcerer, '''Ed Wood''' served as President prior to 1996, by which time he had died. He was considered one of the greatest Presidents in US history.\n\n===[[Victoria Woodhull]]===\n* In the [[alternate history]] short story \"We are Not Amused\" by [[Laura Resnick]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''Victoria Woodhull''' was elected as the 19th President in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], defeating her Democratic opponent [[Horace Greeley]] after a [[Amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] restricted her predecessor [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to one term. President Woodhull, the first woman to hold the office, ran for the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] with the former slave and prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]] as her [[running mate]]. Consequently, Douglass became the first [[African American]] to hold the office of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Shortly after her election, Woodhull began a correspondence with her namesake, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] monarch [[Queen Victoria]]. Although the Queen was pleased to hear that President Woodhull had been acquitted of obscenity charges, she expressed dismay at the President's decision to appoint her younger sister [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin]] as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], given that her medical practices had led to her being indicted for [[manslaughter]] in 1864. Furthermore, the Queen was both shocked and bewildered to learn that President Woodhull was in fact married to Colonel [[James Blood]] and not [[Canning Woodhull]] as she had previously believed. In spite of this, the President's former husband lived with her and her second husband in the [[White House]]. Given this complicated arrangement, Queen Victoria agreed with Woodhull's assessment that it would be wiser to accept advice from neither of her husbands for the time being. As time passed, however, the Queen began to greatly disapprove of the so-called reforms being implemented by the Woodhull administration. She took particular umbrage with the concept of [[free love]], believing that it would lead to the breakdown of the family, and the proposed legalization of [[prostitution]]. While the Queen acknowledged that she could not prevent President Woodhull from following this course of action, she firmly resisted the President's attempts to convince her to adopt these positions herself. Queen Victoria was equally contemptuous of the Secretary of Reproductive Freedom's mandate to supervise research and legislation regarding [[abortion]] and [[birth control]]. She also expressed dismay at the attire of the new [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American ambassador to the Court of St. James]] as her short skirt exposed a considerable portion of her limbs, which the Queen claimed caused the Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] great excitement. Within several years, the changing morals and mores of American society spread to the [[British Empire]] and even to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] itself. In 1875, Queen Victoria's eldest son and [[heir apparent]] [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales]] abandoned his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] as he had chosen to practice free love in the American manner, which he regarded as \"a charming and thoroughly civilized custom.\" For her part, Princess Alexandra objected until being informed by the American ambassador that free love was her right as well. This led to the Princess becoming the constant companion of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], whose more recent work lacked the moral character for which he had previously been known. The Queen's youngest daughters, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], habitually wore the style of short skirt worn by American representatives at court. Thousands upon thousands of young women soon followed suit, many of them establishing \"rebellious musical groups which [played] Spanish and African instruments.\" The [[Duke of York]]'s eldest son left home to live with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes which were beginning to settle in the [[eastern United States]] whereas young men in [[Trafalgar Square]] had begun wearing their hair in the [[Mohawk hairstyle|style]] of the [[Mohawk people]] and protesting the British government's involvement in [[British Raj|India]] and [[South Africa]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] was becoming a major political issue with women besieging [[10 Downing Street]] on a daily basis demanding not only the right to vote but the right to apply for men's jobs and earn equal wages and the right to paid [[maternity leave]]. This had led to widespread factory strikes across the United Kingdom. Furthermore, factories all over the UK had come to a standstill as workers demanded safer working conditions. Prostitutes took to parading up and down [[Piccadilly Circus]] in \"most indecent attire,\" demanding that the government recognize and protect their places of employment. The Queen secluded herself within the walls of [[Windsor Castle]] for six months in the hope that the situation would improve, though Gladstone believed that this downward spiral would continue for years to come. However, he assured his supporters that Britain would never have a [[Margaret Thatcher|female Prime Minister]]. The Queen was particularly upset to learn that her \"once dear friend\" [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Empress Augusta]] of the [[German Empire]] had taken to wearing a short skirt and was an adherent of President Woodhull's theory of a woman's right to [[orgasm]]. Queen Victoria held the President entirely responsible for what she perceived as the downfall of civilization, the chaos overwhelming Britain and Europe, the alienation of her sons and the disgrace of her daughters. After serving the maximum one term prescribed by law, President Woodhull left office on March 4, 1877. Her daughter Zula Maud Woodhull subsequently served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] from 1904 to 1908. Queen Victoria's letters to President Woodhull were included in ''A Correspondence Between the Victorias: An Insight into the Decline of Victorianism, 1872\u20131880'', written by the latter's descendant Dr. Wiantha Woodhull and published by Femme Fatale Press in 1992.\n\n==Y==\n===[[Ralph Yarborough]]===\n* '''Ralph Yarborough''' was [[Robert F.

This is done either as an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual US Presidents with a fictional presidency at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n==V==\n===[[Martin Van Buren]]===\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[For Want of a Nail (novel)|For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga]]'' by the business historian [[Robert Sobel]], '''Martin Van Buren''' was the leader of the Northern Confederation's Conservative Party in the 1820s and the 1830s and was the Governor of the Northern Confederation from 1825 to 1831. Unlike the Northern Confederation's Liberal Party, the Conservatives were poorly organized and had no basic political philosophy. Instead, they simply opposed Liberal policies. The Conservatives did have more popular support than the Liberals and they were able to gain a majority of seats on the Northern Confederation Council in the 1825 elections and Van Buren became governor. The Conservatives' manipulation of the banking system led to the Depression of 1829, which cost them their majority in the 1831 elections.\n\n===[[Clement Vallandigham]]===\n* In the alternate history novel \"By Force of Arms\" by Billy Bennett, '''Clement Vallandigham''' was elected President of the United States in the aftermath of the U.S. defeat in the [[American Civil War]]. His policy was one of appeasement towards the [[Confederate States of America]] in the hope of luring them back into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] by diplomacy. His strategy was a disaster in that [[Jefferson Davis]] took advantage of Vallandigham's perceived weakness by invading and annexing the southern half of the disputed [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]]/[[New Mexico Territory]]. In the aftermath Vallandigham was defeated in the next Presidential election by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].\n* Similar to the above, in [[Ward Moore]]'s novel \"[[Bring the Jubilee]]\", the Confederacy wins the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], wins its independence and imposes a humiliating peace on the rump United States, whereupon  '''Clement Vallandigham''' wins the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] with the electorate turning sharply against the Republicans, held responsible for the disaster. However, Vallandigham's Presidency is haunted by economic crisis and galloping inflation, due to the reparations imposed by the victorious Confederacy. The US would be permanently crippled by the post-war crisis and left a backward country, and future generations would hold Vallandigham  partially responsible.\n\n* In ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]], the invention of a functional [[analytical engine]] by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1824 results in the early arrival of the [[Information Age]] and the ascendancy of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as a [[world power]]. British interference in North America in order to prevent the rise of the United States as a global power results in its fragmentation into a rump United States, the Confederate States, the [[Republic of Texas|Texan Republic]], the [[Californian Republic]], the [[Manhattan]] Commune and a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-dominated 'terra nullius'. In 1855, '''Clement Vallandigham''' is mentioned as being the former Union president (meaning that he had to have left office by 1853 at the latest) and acting as an uninhibited drunkard during a private dinner in [[London]].\n\n===[[Arthur H.

Kennedy|assassinations]] of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. In another alternate timeline in the same novel, '''George Wallace''' is elected as the 43rd President in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], succeeding [[Bill Clinton]]. The novel was published in January 1996, indicating that the author may have believed that Clinton would lose the 1996 election.\n* He served one term (1977\u20131981) in the 1975 movie ''[[Tunnel Vision (1976 film)|Tunnelvision]]'', and was succeeded by an African-American woman named Washington.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[11/22/63]]'' by [[Stephen King]], '''George Wallace''' was elected president in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. His predecessor was [[John F. Kennedy]]. Wallace escalated the [[Vietnam War]] into a [[nuclear war]] that precipitated numerous other atomic conflicts around the globe. The state of [[Maine]] seceded from the United States and was a [[Canada|Canadian]] province by 2011. On May 15, 1972, Wallace was assassinated by [[Arthur Bremer]]. He was succeeded by Vice President [[Curtis LeMay]], who was defeated by his Democratic opponent Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]] in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]].\n\n===[[Henry A. Wallace]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"News from the Front\" by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Henry Wallace''' was serving as vice president under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the time of the United States' entry into [[World War II]] on December 11, 1941, as he was in real life. From then onwards, Roosevelt faced harsh criticism from and strict scrutiny by the American press. The press attacked the Roosevelt administration for not being prepared for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, as well as bringing on the attack by ignorantly imposing an oil embargo on the [[Empire of Japan]]. As the war progressed, the press began to constantly second-guess the Roosevelt administration and to ponder the value of the war. Furthermore, the press revealed important American military secrets, questioning the morality of spying on the [[Axis powers]], decrying the poor state of American technology and giving away planned attacks days before there were to take place, leading to their failures. More importantly, the [[Battle of Midway]] (June 4\u20137, 1942) proved to be a complete disaster. During the first half of 1942, protests against the war began to appear throughout the country and a group of celebrities took it upon themselves to sale to Japan and [[Nazi Germany]] to offer peace. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] faced similar problems in his own country. Matters came to a head when Vice President Wallace broke with the administration and publicly attacked Roosevelt's honesty and competence. Calls for [[impeachment]] grew louder throughout the United States and, finally, Congress began the impeachment process in June 1942. Although the story ends while Roosevelt is still president, it is heavily implied that he will be [[Impeachment in the United States#Impeachment of a U.S. President|impeached]] and removed from office and that Wallace will succeed him as the 33rd President.\n* The [[GURPS Infinite Worlds]] game include the timeline known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Lenin-1|Lenin-1]]'' in which Roosevelt maintained  Wallace as his vice president when he was reelected in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]; consequently '''Henry Wallace''' became president on April 12, 1945, upon Roosevelt's death. His passive stance (and that of his successors) against the [[Soviet Union]] resulted in the steady expansion of [[Communism]] across the globe. By 1989, the isolated and malaise-stricken United States is essentially the sole remaining [[capitalism|capitalist]] country on the planet. Also resulting from Wallace becoming president in 1945 is the \"Hell World\" known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Hell Worlds|Lenin-2]]'' where nuclear war and unconstrained industry have combined to crash the [[biosphere]].\n* Wallace also played an unfortunate role in the history of another unpleasant [[GURPS Infinite Worlds|GURPS]] timeline, known as [[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Reich-5|Reich-5]]. In this timeline [[Giuseppe Zangara]] succeeded in assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1933. He was followed by [[John Nance Garner|Garner]], [[Charles Lindbergh|Lindbergh]] and then '''Henry Wallace''', who all proved unable to handle the [[Great Depression]] - finally leading to the far-right [[William Dudley Pelley]] being elected president in [[1948 United States presidential election|1944]], assuming dictatorial powers, and inviting the Nazis to conquer the US to help him against the pro-democracy resistance - ending with a totally Nazi-dominated world.\n* '''Wallace''' becomes president after World War II in the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' strip ''Hope:... for the Future'' by [[Guy Adams]], set in a [[film noir]] world where magic is real.\n\n===[[Earl Warren]]===\n* In the [[Colonization (series)|''Colonization'' series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Earl Warren''' served as President of the United States from 1961 to 1965. He was elected president in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and would be re-elected in a landslide over his Democratic opponent [[Hubert Humphrey]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. He was in office when the [[The Race (Worldwar)|Race]]'s Colonization Fleet arrived at Earth in 1962 and ordered a secret attack using [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missiles]] fired from a [[artificial satellite|satellite]] that destroyed a dozen of the Fleet's starships. President Warren concealed his role in the affair for several years but the information was ultimately leaked to the Race in 1965 by Sam Yeager through Shiplord Straha, despite Warren's best efforts to silence Yeager through draconian extralegal measures. Fleetlord Atvar threatened war with the United States. Having seen how quickly and easily the Race had defeated Germany in the short-lived Race-German of 1965, President Warren knew he must avoid a war at all costs. Atvar offered two other options: abandon all space exploration for the indefinite future or allow the Race to destroy an American city. Warren knew he that must choose one of the two lest his country be destroyed and he would not give up the space program, a sign of his country's might and technological prowess. Consequently, he surprised and disappointed Atvar by allowing him to destroy [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Warren then committed suicide in the Gray House, the presidential residence in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and was succeeded by his vice president, [[Harold Stassen]].\n\n===[[George Washington]]===\n* In a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the short story \"[[He Walked Around the Horses]]\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], '''General George Washington''' was killed in the [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Battle of Doylestown]] during the short-lived [[American Revolution|rebellion]] of the colonies in [[British North America]] in the 1770s. He died in the arms of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]]. A seemingly insane individual who claimed to be a British diplomat named [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] maintained that the American rebels were successful in their attempts to achieve independence and that Washington survived.\n* In the short story \"The Father of His Country\" by [[Jody Lynn Nye]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''George Washington''' ran against [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the [[1788-89 United States presidential election|first United States presidential election in 1789]]. In spite of the fact that Franklin was 83&nbsp;years old and was rumored to have fathered numerous illegitimate children while serving as [[United States Ambassador to France|ambassador to France]] from 1778 to 1785, he was elected by the [[1st United States Congress]] on April 6, 1789, in part due to reservations voiced by prominent members of Congress such as [[John Hancock]] and [[Charles Thomson]] regarding Washington. They were concerned that it would set a bad precedent for the first President to be a general. Furthermore, Franklin's supporters stressed that he was well liked and respected by foreign heads of state friendly to the United States, had been prominent in matters of diplomacy and government at home and abroad and had already proven that he had the best interests of the nation at heart. Franklin was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]] on April 30, 1789. Franklin's vice president was [[John Adams]] who had supported Washington in Congress, as had his second cousin [[Samuel Adams]]. During his tenure in office, President Franklin attempted to create a more democratic society and managed to live longer than he did in real life, serving until at least 1792.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], '''Colonel George Washington''' was part of a group of American colonists who met with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of the United Kingdom]] in the 1760s and were able to put in place an eleventh hour agreement with avoided [[American Revolution|revolution]]. Washington and the King were immortalized in a painting entitled ''The Two Georges'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], which came to symbolize the friendship between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[North American Union]]. In his later career as the [[Governor-general]] of the North American Union, Washington implemented a policy which halted the westward expansion of European settlement for some decades and gave a chance to certain [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes such as the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Cherokee]] to modernize and keep much of their lands. For that reasons, he greatly revered by Native Americans into the late 20th century. The Iroquois believed that he was the only white person to be admitted to their religion's version of [[Paradise]]. Conversely, he is considered a traitor by the nativist, separatist organization, the [[Sons of Liberty]]. He is also the namesake of the Province of Washington (analogous with Saskatchewan) and an NAU car marque.\n* In the short story \"Arnoldstown\" by [[Mitchell Cummings]], '''General George Washington''' died of [[pneumonia]] during the winter of 1777\u20131778, which led to the near disintegration of the [[Continental Army]]. [[Benedict Arnold]] eventually succeeded him as its commanding general, rebuilt the army and snatched victory from the jaws of near-certain defeat. After independence had been secured through the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), Arnold went on to be elected as the first President of the United States in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]]. He was the most revered of all the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] in later generations. The story's name is derived from the US capital in this timeline being [[Washington, D.C.|Arnoldstown, D.C.]] with his name also being commemorated in the state of [[Washington (state)|Arnoldia]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] and numerous other place-names.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''George Washington''' served as the first President from April 30, 1789, to March 4, 1797, as he was in real life. After the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862), U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as the most memorable of presidents, though only Roosevelt was viewed in an entirely positive light. As a young man, Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader. However, the general public did not always remembered kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the US suffered because of it \u2013 as did that of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the US occupation authorities in [[Canada]]). Nonetheless, the US rebuilt the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). The Confederates were themselves saddened of the monument being destroyed in the war as well, as they were fond of George Washington, too. In fact, before 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]. The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under Anthony Dresser, used Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan, \"We need a New Revolution\". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have \"sold out the South to the damnyankees\" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first and President of the United States second. [[Washington and Lee University|Washington University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[nuclear weapon|superbomb]], retained its name and the statue of Washington that stood in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] survived both Great Wars.\n* In [[Michael Flynn (writer)|Michael Flynn]]'s [[novella]] ''[[The Forest of Time]]'', in the late 1780's General '''George Washington''' took a personal interest in the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee Wars]] - i.e. the violent conflict between Pennamites from [[Pennsylvania]] and Yankees from [[Connecticut]], both of whom laid claim to the [[Wyoming Valley]] and sent rival groups of settlers to it. In a fatally misguided step, Washington placed a unit of the Virginia Militia, commanded by himself, as a neutral buffer between Pennamites and Yankees. This culminated with the Virginians being trapped and decimated in a crossfire, Washington himself being among those killed. When the news of  Washington's death reached [[Philadelphia]], where the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was just convening, [[Benjamin Franklin]] suffered a stroke and died, too. The convention broke up in consternation, and the [[Constitution of the United States]] was never adopted and a Federal Government never created. The loose structure of the [[Continental Congress]] eventually disintegrated, with the Thirteen Colonies going each its own way as full-fledged nation states - except that the Yankees of [[New England]] did create their own more narrow confederation. In this situation, Yankee settlers - backed by the rest of New England - held on to much of the Wyoming Valley, their conflict with Pennsylvania further escalating. Eventually, two mutually hostile nation states emerged, possessing fully equipped regular armies - hereditary enemies which habitually and repeatedly go to war with each other. Posterity remembered George Washington as a talented general who won what was remembered as ''The War Against the British''. However, that war itself was remembered only as a temporary and ephemeral alliance, whose participants later often went to war with each other. Washington having been a Virginian, most people in North America thought of him as a foreigner and people in Virginia's neighbors thought of him as having been from an enemy country. \n* In the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] novel [[The Probability Broach]] by [[L. Neil Smith]], the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] succeeds after [[Albert Gallatin]] intercedes to help the farmers rather than the fledgling United States government as he does in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a [[Second American Revolution]]. This eventually leads to the overthrowing and execution of '''George Washington''' by firing squad for [[treason]] in 1794 and the United States Government being reformed. This included the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] being declared null and void, a new caretaker government being organized with all taxes being repelled in 1795, and the [[Articles of Confederation]] being revised with a much emphasis on individual freedom in 1797. After the war, Gallatin would serve as the 2nd and 7th president from 1794 to 1812 and from 1836 to 1840 with his actions later starting a [[libertarian]] state known as the [[North American Confederacy]] in 1893. Despite this, Gallatin insisted that historians would still count George Washington as the first president.\n* In the novel ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], in which the United States lost the American Revolution, '''Washington''' was executed for treason. America remained under control of the [[British Empire]] well into the 20th century. Washington's descendant, a gifted engineer still living in the ancestral [[Mount Vernon]], undertakes the stupendous project of a tunnel under the Atlantic which would bind America closer than ever to Britain.\n* In the alternate history series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], '''George Washington''' is mentioned as \"Lord Potomac\", who served under the English crown during the alternate version of the [[American Revolution]]. However, he surrendered his army and was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] for treason.\n* In the story \"Paine's Paine\" by Margaret Klein, conspirators led by the turncoat [[Thomas Hickey (soldier)|Thomas Hickey]] managing to kidnap '''George Washington''' in 1776 and deliver him to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commander, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]. Transported by a British warship, Washington was taken to the [[Tower of London]], to await trial on charges of [[High treason]]. However, the revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] secretly traveled to [[England]] and with the help of British radicals effected a dramatic prison break. Paine and the freed Washington boarded a ship captained by [[John Paul Jones]], which eluded the [[Royal Navy]] and arrived triumphantly at [[Boston]]. Paine was venerated as a hero and appointed as Washington's second in command. Throughout the rest of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the two of them together led the American forces. There was, however, a fundamental difference between  Washington's conservatism and Paine's radical ideas, which came into the open once independence was achieved. Eventually, Washington and Paine became bitter political foes. Following the first presidential election in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]], Washington was elected President and Paine - Vice President, but there was increasing friction between them which culminated in a violent clash in August 1790. Washington was killed by a militia supporting Paine. He himself denied responsibility and expressed \"great regret\" at Washington's death. In the aftermath, Paine assumed the Presidency but was regarded as an illegal usurper by a considerable part of the American public and initially sought to mollify his opponents and reach a compromise, but in vain. After surviving three assassination attempts and facing several armed insurrections, Paine saw no alternative but resorting to increasingly harsh measures against his opponents. These tarnished his reputation and earned him the nickname \"The American [[Robespierre]]\". In the face of mounting opposition, Paine tried to rally his followers, including radical intellectuals and working-class crowds, around a program of thorough social and political reform. He had some successes but was assassinated in November 1792, after issuing a Proclamation for Emancipation of the Slaves which he did not live to implement. After Paine's death, there was a sharp conservative backlash, Paine's main supporters being arrested or fleeing to exile in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] [[French First Republic|France]]. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], recalled into Emergency Session, elected [[Alexander Hamilton]] as president. Hamilton swiftly proceeded to annul Paine's reforms and was re-elected president in 1793. Thomas Paine remained one of the most controversial figures in American history, some venerating him as a great hero and martyr while others regarded him as the most black of villains. At every crisis point in American history over the next centuries, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Gulf War]], Paine's name and heritage were inevitably evoked yet again. \n* In the story \"Under the Dark Cloud\" by Abigail Stanton Wade, a fierce hurricane broke out during the [[Battle of Long Island]], scattering the [[Royal Navy]] ships and drowning many of them, with devastating losses for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. Also many of the British troops on land were decimated by the storm, their commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] being crush to death by a falling tree - while American troops escaped virtually unscathed. This outcome, coming at the very moment when the American Revolutionary cause seemed on the verge of losing [[New York City]] to the British, was widely perceived as an act of Divine Providence. During a mass Thanksgiving ceremony at the New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], a preacher referred to '''George Washington''' as \"God's [[Anointed]]\" - a usage which was soon taken up by others. With Washington winning several more notable victories against the British, a growing number of people started to seriously regard him as \"God's Chosen\", entrusted with \"a Divine Mission\". Washington cultivated  this phenomenon for political purposes - but in the following years he seemed to start believing in it himself. The Washington [[cult of personality]] reached its peak when he brought the war to a successful conclusion in January 1779 - forcing the British to recognize American independence. The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], held at 1782 in New York, was dominated by Washington and his supporters. The Constitution adopted provided for a President elected for life (and there was little doubt who it would be), a [[United States Senate|Senate]] whose members would likewise sit for life, and a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] elected by limited franchise. The \"Washington Constitution\" alienated many Democrats who withdrew in protest when the Convention failed to include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. [[Gouverneur Morris]], originally a friend and staunch supporter of George Washington, was repelled by what he perceived as Washington's increasing authoritarianism, arrogance and intolerance towards anyone who opposed him. Morris sought to promote a compromise between Washington and his opponents - but in vain. Soon after Washington assumed the Life Presidency, an armed rebellion broke out - which at Washington's order was put down with considerable brutality. Washington's opponents were driven underground - but after half a year, three of them managed to assassinate Washington. Thereupon, the United States was plunged into a full-scale [[American Civil War|civil war]]. This was exacerbated by the British reneging on the agreement, launching a large-scale invasion of the US and attempting to put in place a puppet President. Forces loyal to [[Thomas Jefferson]] succeeded in repulsing the British invasion and breaking up the last of the die-hard Washingtonians - but Jefferson was himself killed in the last battle. In the aftermath, Gouverneur Morris came to the fore in the efforts to achieve reconciliation - specifically, in convening a new Constitutional Convention. The Washington Constitution was scrapped. The new Constitution, much of it drafted by Morris, provided for a President elected for a single six-year term and ineligible for re-election, an elected Senate except for five Life Senators, and a Bill of Rights comprising thirteen articles. The new Constitution gained wide support and Gouverneur Morris was elected President by a large majority. He considered the furthering of reconciliation as his main task, and got nicknamed \"The Great Healer\". After his death, Congress bestowed upon him the title \"Father of His Country\" and resolved to count him as having been First President of the United States - the Washington Years being dismissed as \"an interregnum\".\n*In the novel ''Washington's Dirigible'' (part of the ''[[John Barnes (author)#Timeline Wars series| The Timeline Wars series]]'' by [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]), a colossal war is raging across countless [[alternate history]] timelines, between a progressive timeline originating from a surviving [[Fifth-century Athens| Periclean Athens]] and an extremely oppressive slave society resulting from a [[Ancient Carthage |Carthaginian]] victory over Rome. The Athenians send an agent to the 18th Century who creates a new timeline by getting [[Benjamin Franklin]] appointed as the tutor of the young King [[George III]], resulting in making him a Liberal King, sympathetic to the aspirations of the North American colonists; also, many technologies and devices are introduced into the 18th Century, such as railways, dirigibles, radio and electricity (as well as flush toilets). However, the Carthaginian \"Closers\" intervene, kidnapping the King and replace him by an authoritarian impostor. '''George Washington''' becomes aware of the situation and takes a major part in the struggle to save the rightful King George III and restore him to the throne, eventually setting the world back on the route to a progressive and forward-looking British Empire. Finding out that the Carthaginian \"Closers\" had plotted to make everybody in the world into slaves, regardless of skin color, makes Washington into an opponent of slavery and he emancipates his own Black slaves and hires them as free servants. Seeing things going well in his own world and no need to create the United States, Washington becomes a full time agent of the Athenians, undertaking dangerous missions at various alternate history timelines. Instead of becoming \"Father of His Country\", George Washington becomes the \"father\" of various countries in various histories which he helped free from the oppression of the \"Closers\".\n\n===[[Daniel Webster]]===\n* In George Field's story \"Daniel Webster's Road to the Devil\", '''Daniel Webster''' avoids the accident which in actual history caused his death, and is elected president in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] over [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Vowing to \"Preserve the Union at all costs\" by strictly enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]], Webster attempts to crush the [[Underground Railroad]] by setting up a network of spies and organizing extensive raids by Federal troops. One of these, at a farm in [[Massachusetts]], develops into a large-scale firefight, leading to the death of dozens of Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] as well as escaped slaves. This precipitates secessionist agitation in [[New England]]. President Webster, setting out to reason with the Massachusetts Legislature, is ambushed by abolitionists on his way to [[Boston]] and assassinated along with his Vice President, leaving the presidential succession doubtful and hotly disputed. The New England states go ahead with formally declaring all fugitive slaves welcome in their territory \u2013 which causes the South to secede in turn. The US plunges into a confused three-way [[American Civil War|civil war]] \u2013 exacerbated by large-scale [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] riots, attacks on [[Irish American]]s and the burning of Catholic churches, which prompts the Irish to form militias and embark on violent retaliations. In the confusion, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his radical Abolitionists succeed in seizing several arsenals, arming a large number of slaves and setting off several major [[slave rebellion]]s. After eleven years of total chaos, with widespread destruction and bloodshed throughout the country and no less than nine competing presidents setting themselves up at various locations, American leaders in 1864 appeal to [[Queen Victoria]] to help restore order. The war-weary population mostly welcomes the arrival of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is annulled and the former US territories are united with [[Canada]] into the [[British Dominion|Dominion]] of \"[[British North America]]\".\n\n===[[Adam Weishaupt]]===\n* '''Adam Weishaupt''' is the first President in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], after murdering and taking the identity of [[George Washington]].\n* Also ''The Secret Benefactor'' by Barbara Norden posits that '''Adam Weishaupt''' killed [[George Washington]] and took his identity. However, as presented by Norden this was a well intentioned act, since the original Washington had planned to subvert the Constitution, suspend the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and establish a hereditary monarchy, and only due to Weishaupt was American democracy maintained. Later on, in 1861 Weishaupt killed [[Abraham Lincoln]] and took his identity, since the original Lincoln did not intend to abolish slavery but was going to defeat the South and keep slavery intact - which would have led to a [[Second American Civil War|second and much worse Civil War]] twenty years later. A century later Weishaupt found it necessary to do it a third time, in 1961 killing [[John Kennedy]] and taking his identity - since the real Kennedy would have started a [[Third World War]] over the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and killed most of Humanity. During [[WWII]], Weishaupt thought [[Franklin Roosevelt ]] was doing a good job and there was no need to interfere with him, and therefore Weishaupt turned his talents in the opposite direction - killing [[Adolf Hitler]] and taking his place and as Hitler making a series of deliberate very bad decisions which greatly damaged Nazi Germany's war effort. In between, Weishaupt intentionally published a series of writings depicting himself and the Illuminati as evil schemers, in order to distract attention from what he was really doing. The book is written as a first-person narrative set down in 1997 by Weishaupt - extremely long-lived, but not an immortal - as he lay dying of old age at a secret Illuminati hideout in the Himalayas. Having found a worthy successor, who proved herself by acting behind the scenes to ensure a peaceful end to the Cold War and personally overseeing the breaking down of the [[Berlin Wall]], Weishaupt charges her - or her own successors - with publishing his book \"when the world is ready for it\", but cautioning \"This account is incomplete. The secret of some of the things I had to do had best die with me\".\n\n===[[Kanye West]]===\n* In the song \"Black Friday\" by [[Kendrick Lamar]], Lamar envisions a future where West becomes president. Under West's presidency, Kendrick would be allowed to receive oral sex in the [[Oval Office]] and play West's debut album ''[[The College Dropout]]'' inside of the White House.\n\n===[[Burton K. Wheeler]]===\n* In the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' by [[Philip Roth]], '''Burton Wheeler''' succeeded [[Charles Lindbergh]] as the 33rd President in 1942. Wheeler was Lindbergh's vice president in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], elected on an Isolationist ticket. Following Lindbergh's disappearance, he serves as President for eight days, a period marked by martial law and anti-Semitic rioting. Wheeler is eventually impeached but ultimately pardoned by Franklin Roosevelt (elected in an emergency presidential election concurrent with the 1942 midterm elections).\n* In ''[[The Divide (novel)|The Divide]]'' by [[William Overgard]], '''Burton Wheeler''', running as the Isolationist Party candidate, defeats President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] on a pledge to keep America out of war after the Nazis force the surrender of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. After [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] has overrun all of Russia, both Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] attack and invade the United States in 1941. President Wheeler surrenders the United States to the Axis after a devastating bombardment of missiles from occupied Canada. The surrender takes place on April 20, 1948, Adolf Hitler's fifty ninth birthday. President Wheeler, Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]], and other U.S. Government officials are executed by garrote in a meat packing plant outside of Washington D.C. after being found guilty of war crimes. Wheeler does leave behind a secret installation where work of producing an atomic bomb continues, in the hope that it would eventually help in liberating the country.\n* In the short story \"Fighting Bob\" by [[Kristine Kathryn Rusch]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] won the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 election]] with '''Burton Wheeler''' as his [[running mate]]. La Follette was the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] candidate, defeating the Republican incumbent [[Calvin Coolidge]] and their Democratic opponent [[John W. Davis]]. He entered office as the 31st President on March 4, 1925. However, President La Follette's term in office proved to be short-lived as he died on June 18, 1925 (as he did in real life). Wheeler succeeded him as the 32nd President.\n\n===[[Hugh Lawson White]]===\n* In Burt F. Dealon's Alternative History novelette ''Liberate the Earth!'', the Reptile extraterrestrials of the Xiupograzixt Empire secretly intervened in the [[1836 United States presidential election]] to unite the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] around the candidature of '''Hugh Lawson White''' and get him elected President, in the correct expectation that his insistence on limiting the power of the Federal government would weaken the US. This was part of various acts in other countries, such as assassinating [[Queen Victoria]] and having a weak and unpopular king (her uncle [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]]) take the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] Throne in her place, overthrowing [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis Philippe]] and plunging [[July Monarchy|France]] into a devastating civil war, instigating a civil war in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as well, fabricating sexual scandals to discredit the [[Habsburg]] Monarchy and starting a split in the [[Catholic Church]]. All of these provocations helped \"soften up\" Humanity towards the open Xiupograzixt takeover in 1841, with Reptile warriors armed with energy weapons suddenly landing in all important world capitals. President White uncovers a human traitor in the Reptile service who had infiltrated his administration and served as a senior aide, and discovers to his chagrin that he had been unknowingly the Reptiles' dupe all along his Presidency. The President orders the traitor executed and himself stages a hopeless last stand in the [[White House]], with a few remnants of the [[United States Army|US Army]] who had sworn to die at the President's side. As Earth becomes a minor Xiupograzixt province, with humans reduced to little more than expandable slaves for the Reptiles, Americans - and humans in other continents as well - secretly cherish the memory of President White as a great hero and martyr. When the Earth is finally liberated from Xiupograzixt oppression in the Liberation War of 1976, Revolutionary leaders inaugurate an monument for the heroic Last President at the site of the destroyed White House.\n\n===[[Harrison A. Williams]]===\n* '''Harrison Williams''' was a President in the 1960s in the timeline of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s \"[[Double Star]]\". Not much information is given, as this is an event of the distant past for the book's protagonists. In 1956, when Heinlein wrote the book, Williams was a rising young politician, recently elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 34, and the idea of his finally achieving the Presidency was a reasonable conjecture.\n\n===[[Wendell Willkie]]===\n* '''Wendell Willkie''' was elected president in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] (when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] decided to not seek a third term) in the [[S. M. Stirling]] novel ''[[Marching Through Georgia (novel)|Marching Through Georgia]]''. He led the United States into involvement in [[World War II]]. His vice president was [[Charles L. McNary]].\n\n===[[Woodrow Wilson]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"The Bull Moose at Bay\" by [[Mike Resnick]] contained in his anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'', Roosevelt was the subject of an assassination attempt carried out by [[John Flammang Schrank]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on October 14, 1912, as he was in reality. Whereas he was shot in the chest on that occasion in real life, Schrank's bullet missed him in the story. Running as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate, Roosevelt went on to defeat both '''Woodrow Wilson''' and the extremely unpopular incumbent Republican President [[William Howard Taft]] in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]]. Shortly after the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking of the passenger liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] by the German [[U-boat]] ''[[SM U-20 (Germany)|U-20]]'' on May 7, 1915, President Roosevelt brought the [[American entry into World War I|United States into the Great War]], resulting in the defeat of the [[German Empire]] by the [[Allies of World War I|US and its allies]] within less than a year. This made the United States a world power. In spite of this and the fact that the economy was experiencing a boom, Roosevelt was widely expected to lose the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]] to Wilson. Although the story ends prior to the election, it is heavily implied that Wilson will indeed be elected and therefore take office as the 29th president on March 4, 1917.\n* In the short story \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" by [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]] contained in the anthology ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', '''Woodrow Wilson''' was defeated in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]] by former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate. Roosevelt became the last democratically elected President of the United States. Before he could take office, however, Roosevelt was assassinated in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on December 19, 1912, by the [[marksman|sharpshooter]] and [[Exhibition shooting|exhibition shooter]] [[Annie Oakley]] while attempting to break up a labor strike with the help of the [[Rough Riders]] at the Chicago [[Union Stockyards]]. Consequently, Vice President-elect [[Charles Foster Kane]], an extremely wealthy newspaper mogul, was inaugurated as the 28th President on March 4, 1913. During his presidency, Kane led the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption. President Kane rigged the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], defeating Wilson and the Republican candidate former president [[William Howard Taft]] as Roosevelt had done in 1912. By February 1917, Wilson had been assassinated and many believed that Kane's agents were responsible. Wilson came to be regarded as a martyr by those opposed to Kane's regime. The [[Socialist Party of America]], led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], gained considerable report among the disenfranchised populace and soon the unrest led to outright [[Second American Civil War]]. After the [[Winter Palace|storming of the White House]] by the Socialist faction on July 4, 1917, Kane was shot and killed by Oakley, as Roosevelt had been four and a half years earlier. This resulted in the establishment of the United Socialist States of America (USSA) with Debs as its first president.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''Woodrow Wilson''' served as the 9th [[President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916, serving the maximum one term prescribed by the [[Confederate States Constitution]], and led the country into the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). Following the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]'s [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914]], President Wilson affirmed the commitment of the [[Confederate States of America]] to the [[Triple Entente|Quadruple Entente]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[Russian Empire|Russia]], describing the conflict between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Serbia]] as a case of a smaller nation being oppressed by a larger one. In his speech rallying the nation to war, Wilson reminded the Confederate people of the crucial role which Britain and France had played in the CSA's achievement of independence during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) as well as their importance to its continued survival. He called upon the Confederate States to stand up against the \"tyrannical\" [[German Empire]] and the \"bitter\" United States, reminding the crowd of the \"dark path\" which the US had followed and that it was the CSA's duty to be a continuing force for freedom in the world by entering the war. By the middle of 1915, the Great War, expected to be over by the previous [[Christmas]], had settled into a bloody stalemate in both [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. With only a few months left before the CS presidential election, Wilson was a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]. Nevertheless, he continued to rally the Confederate States while at the same time campaigning for his vice president [[Gabriel Semmes]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] presidential candidate. By this time, certain quarters were of the opinion that Wilson had not prosecuted the war as vigorously as he could have. President Wilson left office on March 4, 1916, and was succeeded by Semmes as the 10th president. In September 1917, the Great War ended with the defeat of the Confederate States and its allies. Wilson lived the remainder of his life in relative obscurity. Following his death in 1924, he was buried in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and was remembered with a certain fondness by later generations in the CS.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[1920: America's Great War]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]], '''Woodrow Wilson''' is running for a third term in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] despite being bedridden. He has been praised for bringing peace to Europe as he acted as mediator for the Treaty of Princeton, and has since enacted strong [[Non-interventionism|isolationist policies]] in the U.S. and making budget cuts from the U.S. military, thinking that the world is finally at everlasting peace. However, the [[German Empire]] has greatly expanded its military influence almost unopposed across the world due to the reparations and military restrictions imposed on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente nations]], which lost [[World War I]] in 1914. German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] sees the United States as the only remaining nation that can threaten Germany, and has prepared a plan for war. By aiding the German-friendly [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]] forces of [[Venustiano Carranza]], Mexico's government is overthrown and becomes a German ally. [[Mexico]] is then to be used as a staging point to launch a joint German-Mexican surprise invasion into the [[Southwestern United States]] with the goal of the Germans to gain the vast natural resources the Empire needs while Mexico tries to re-annex [[Mexican Cession|territory lost to the United States]]. After it is found that Wilson has died in his sleep, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Thomas R. Marshall]] is next in the [[United States presidential line of succession|chain of succession]] but formally steps down for not wanting the responsibility, and thus [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] is sworn in instead. President Lansing is fully aware of the threat of invasion from Mexico and has the U.S. military desperately scramble a defense, but comes too little to late as the German Army crosses the [[Mexico-United States border|border]] into [[California]] and the [[Mexican Army]] crosses the [[Rio Grande]] into [[Texas]].\n\n===[[Oprah Winfrey]]===\n* She is referenced as being President in 2030 in an episode of the short-lived science-fiction lawyer show ''[[Century City (television)|Century City]]''\n* She is elected president in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] in an alternate history episode of ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' called [[Return of the King (Boondocks episode)|Return of the King]] around the same time [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (who survived his [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination attempt in 1968]]) died in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] at the age of 91.\n\n===[[Ed Wood]]===\n* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the ''[[Sliders]]'' Season Two premiere \"Into the Mystic\" in which the United States was ruled by a commercial empire run by a mysterious sorcerer, '''Ed Wood''' served as President prior to 1996, by which time he had died. He was considered one of the greatest Presidents in US history.\n\n===[[Victoria Woodhull]]===\n* In the [[alternate history]] short story \"We are Not Amused\" by [[Laura Resnick]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''Victoria Woodhull''' was elected as the 19th President in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], defeating her Democratic opponent [[Horace Greeley]] after a [[Amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] restricted her predecessor [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to one term. President Woodhull, the first woman to hold the office, ran for the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] with the former slave and prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]] as her [[running mate]]. Consequently, Douglass became the first [[African American]] to hold the office of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Shortly after her election, Woodhull began a correspondence with her namesake, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] monarch [[Queen Victoria]]. Although the Queen was pleased to hear that President Woodhull had been acquitted of obscenity charges, she expressed dismay at the President's decision to appoint her younger sister [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin]] as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], given that her medical practices had led to her being indicted for [[manslaughter]] in 1864. Furthermore, the Queen was both shocked and bewildered to learn that President Woodhull was in fact married to Colonel [[James Blood]] and not [[Canning Woodhull]] as she had previously believed. In spite of this, the President's former husband lived with her and her second husband in the [[White House]]. Given this complicated arrangement, Queen Victoria agreed with Woodhull's assessment that it would be wiser to accept advice from neither of her husbands for the time being. As time passed, however, the Queen began to greatly disapprove of the so-called reforms being implemented by the Woodhull administration. She took particular umbrage with the concept of [[free love]], believing that it would lead to the breakdown of the family, and the proposed legalization of [[prostitution]]. While the Queen acknowledged that she could not prevent President Woodhull from following this course of action, she firmly resisted the President's attempts to convince her to adopt these positions herself. Queen Victoria was equally contemptuous of the Secretary of Reproductive Freedom's mandate to supervise research and legislation regarding [[abortion]] and [[birth control]]. She also expressed dismay at the attire of the new [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American ambassador to the Court of St. James]] as her short skirt exposed a considerable portion of her limbs, which the Queen claimed caused the Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] great excitement. Within several years, the changing morals and mores of American society spread to the [[British Empire]] and even to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] itself. In 1875, Queen Victoria's eldest son and [[heir apparent]] [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales]] abandoned his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] as he had chosen to practice free love in the American manner, which he regarded as \"a charming and thoroughly civilized custom.\" For her part, Princess Alexandra objected until being informed by the American ambassador that free love was her right as well. This led to the Princess becoming the constant companion of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], whose more recent work lacked the moral character for which he had previously been known. The Queen's youngest daughters, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], habitually wore the style of short skirt worn by American representatives at court. Thousands upon thousands of young women soon followed suit, many of them establishing \"rebellious musical groups which [played] Spanish and African instruments.\" The [[Duke of York]]'s eldest son left home to live with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes which were beginning to settle in the [[eastern United States]] whereas young men in [[Trafalgar Square]] had begun wearing their hair in the [[Mohawk hairstyle|style]] of the [[Mohawk people]] and protesting the British government's involvement in [[British Raj|India]] and [[South Africa]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] was becoming a major political issue with women besieging [[10 Downing Street]] on a daily basis demanding not only the right to vote but the right to apply for men's jobs and earn equal wages and the right to paid [[maternity leave]]. This had led to widespread factory strikes across the United Kingdom. Furthermore, factories all over the UK had come to a standstill as workers demanded safer working conditions. Prostitutes took to parading up and down [[Piccadilly Circus]] in \"most indecent attire,\" demanding that the government recognize and protect their places of employment. The Queen secluded herself within the walls of [[Windsor Castle]] for six months in the hope that the situation would improve, though Gladstone believed that this downward spiral would continue for years to come. However, he assured his supporters that Britain would never have a [[Margaret Thatcher|female Prime Minister]]. The Queen was particularly upset to learn that her \"once dear friend\" [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Empress Augusta]] of the [[German Empire]] had taken to wearing a short skirt and was an adherent of President Woodhull's theory of a woman's right to [[orgasm]]. Queen Victoria held the President entirely responsible for what she perceived as the downfall of civilization, the chaos overwhelming Britain and Europe, the alienation of her sons and the disgrace of her daughters. After serving the maximum one term prescribed by law, President Woodhull left office on March 4, 1877. Her daughter Zula Maud Woodhull subsequently served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] from 1904 to 1908. Queen Victoria's letters to President Woodhull were included in ''A Correspondence Between the Victorias: An Insight into the Decline of Victorianism, 1872\u20131880'', written by the latter's descendant Dr. Wiantha Woodhull and published by Femme Fatale Press in 1992.\n\n==Y==\n===[[Ralph Yarborough]]===\n* '''Ralph Yarborough''' was [[Robert F.

He organized [[sit-ins]] at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the [[Nashville Student Movement]]. The [[Nashville sit-ins|Nashville sit-in movement]] was responsible for the desegregation of lunch counters in downtown Nashville.

While a student, he was invited to attend [[nonviolence]] workshops held in the basement of Clark Memorial United Methodist Church by the Rev.

At that time, several states of the old Confederacy still enforced laws prohibiting black and white riders from sitting next to each other on public transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and revived by [[James Farmer]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. The Freedom Rides also exposed the passivity of the government regarding violence against citizens of the country who were simply acting in accordance with the law.<ref name=CNN>{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-05-10/us/access.lewis.freedom.rides_1_white-men-angry-mob-blacks?_s=PM:US|work=CNN|title=Civil Rights Timeline|date=January 31, 2006 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808153339/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-05-10/us/access.lewis.freedom.rides_1_white-men-angry-mob-blacks?_s=PM%3AUS|archivedate=August 8, 2012}}</ref>\nThe federal government had trusted the notoriously [[racism|racist]] [[Alabama]] police to protect the Riders, but did nothing itself, except to have [[FBI]] agents take notes.

At 21 years old, Lewis was the first of the Freedom Riders to be assaulted while in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]]. He tried to enter a whites-only waiting room and two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs. Nevertheless, only two weeks later Lewis joined a ''Freedom Ride'' that was bound for Jackson. \"We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal. We knew our lives could be threatened, but we had made up our minds not to turn back,\" Lewis said recently in regard to his perseverance following the act of violence.<ref name=SmithsonianMagazine>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Freedom-Riders.html?c=y&page=1|title=The Freedom Riders, Then and Now|work=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> Lewis was also imprisoned for forty days in the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] in [[Sunflower County, Mississippi]], after participating in a Freedom Riders activity in that state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minor|first=Bill|url=http://www.desototimes.com/articles/2010/04/02/opinion/editorials/doc4bb645d51cbc1161890108.txt|title=New law meant to eliminate existing 'donut hole'|department=Editorial|newspaper=[[DeSoto Times-Tribune]]|edition=online|location=<!-- Can't figure out if it's in Nesbit, Mississippi or Hernando, Mississippi - http://www.desototimes.com/site/contact.html lists two street addresses -->|date=April 2, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with [[CNN]] during the 40th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Lewis recounted the sheer amount of violence he and the 12 other original Freedom Riders endured. In [[Anniston, Alabama]], the bus was fire-bombed after [[Ku Klux Klan]] members deflated its tires, forcing it to come to a stop. Lewis, however, was not present on that particular day. In [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the Riders were mercilessly beaten, and in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], an angry mob met the bus, and Lewis was hit in the head with a wooden crate. \"It was very violent.

Lewis's experience at that point was already widely respected. His courage and his tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and nonviolence made him emerge as a leader. By this time, he had been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent struggle for equal justice. He held the post of chairman until 1966. During his tenure, SNCC opened [[Freedom Schools]], launched the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], and organized some of the voter registration efforts during the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma voting rights campaign]]. As the chairman of SNCC, Lewis had written a speech in reaction to the Civil Rights Bill of 1963. He denounced the bill because it didn't protect African Americans against police brutality or provide African Americans with the right to vote.[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march) - NARA - 542056.jpg|thumb|left|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march)]]\n\nIn 1963, as chairman of SNCC Lewis was named one of the [[Big Six (activists)|\"Big Six\"]] leaders who were organizing the [[March on Washington]], the occasion of Dr. King's celebrated \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, along with [[Whitney Young]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[James Farmer]] and [[Roy Wilkins]]; Lewis was the youngest of the Big Six. Lewis also spoke at the March. Discussing the occasion, historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: \"At the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that heard [[Martin Luther King]]'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by organizers of the March to avoid offending the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration]].

The Freedom Summer was an attempt to expose college students from around the country to the perils of African-American life in the South. Lewis traveled the country encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people in Mississippi, the most recalcitrant state in the union, to register and vote. Lewis became nationally known during his prominent role in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when, on March 7, 1965 \u2013 a day that would become known as \"[[Selma to Montgomery marches#\"Bloody Sunday\" events|Bloody Sunday]]\" \u2013 Lewis and fellow activist [[Hosea Williams]] led over 600 marchers across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. At the end of the bridge, they were met by [[Alabama Highway Patrol|Alabama State Troopers]] who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged [[tear gas]] and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with night sticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he escaped across the bridge to [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]], the movement's headquarter church in Selma.

Your remarks about Senator Sanders and his civil rights record are deeply offensive not only to me but to hundreds of thousands of others dedicated to and participants in the Civil Rights Movement. In all honesty, John, when did you become the doorkeeper at the entrance to the Civil Rights gate? I cannot fathom how you think you advance the cause for Secretary Clinton by denigrating Senator Sanders or anyone else no matter how modest their contributions might be in your eyes.\u201d Lewis later clarified his statement saying \"During the late \u201950s and \u201960s when I was more engaged, [Sanders] was not there.

As a student, he was very dedicated to the Civil Rights Movement. He organized [[sit-ins]] at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the [[Nashville Student Movement]]. The [[Nashville sit-ins|Nashville sit-in movement]] was responsible for the desegregation of lunch counters in downtown Nashville. Lewis was arrested and jailed many times in the nonviolent movement to desegregate the downtown area of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressman John R.

While a student, he was invited to attend [[nonviolence]] workshops held in the basement of Clark Memorial United Methodist Church by the Rev. [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]] and Rev. [[Kelly Miller Smith]]. There, Lewis and many of his fellow students became dedicated adherents to the discipline and philosophy of nonviolence, which he still practices today.\n\n===Freedom Rides===\n\nIn 1961, Lewis became one of the 13 original [[Freedom Riders]].<ref name=ReportingCivilRights/><ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom Rides |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides |website=King Encyclopedia |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref> There were seven whites and six blacks who were determined to ride from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans in an integrated fashion. At that time, several states of the old Confederacy still enforced laws prohibiting black and white riders from sitting next to each other on public transportation. The Freedom Ride, originated by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and revived by [[James Farmer]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960) that declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. The Freedom Rides also exposed the passivity of the government regarding violence against citizens of the country who were simply acting in accordance with the law.<ref name=CNN>{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-05-10/us/access.lewis.freedom.rides_1_white-men-angry-mob-blacks?_s=PM:US|work=CNN|title=Civil Rights Timeline|date=January 31, 2006 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808153339/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-05-10/us/access.lewis.freedom.rides_1_white-men-angry-mob-blacks?_s=PM%3AUS|archivedate=August 8, 2012}}</ref>\nThe federal government had trusted the notoriously [[racism|racist]] [[Alabama]] police to protect the Riders, but did nothing itself, except to have [[FBI]] agents take notes. The [[Kennedy Administration]] then called for a cooling-off period, a moratorium on Freedom Rides.<ref name=FreedomAlbany/>\n\nIn the South, Lewis and other nonviolent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs, arrested at times and taken to jail. At 21 years old, Lewis was the first of the Freedom Riders to be assaulted while in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]]. He tried to enter a whites-only waiting room and two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs. Nevertheless, only two weeks later Lewis joined a ''Freedom Ride'' that was bound for Jackson. \"We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal.

Lewis's experience at that point was already widely respected. His courage and his tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and nonviolence made him emerge as a leader. By this time, he had been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent struggle for equal justice. He held the post of chairman until 1966. During his tenure, SNCC opened [[Freedom Schools]], launched the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], and organized some of the voter registration efforts during the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma voting rights campaign]]. As the chairman of SNCC, Lewis had written a speech in reaction to the Civil Rights Bill of 1963. He denounced the bill because it didn't protect African Americans against police brutality or provide African Americans with the right to vote.[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march) - NARA - 542056.jpg|thumb|left|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march)]]\n\nIn 1963, as chairman of SNCC Lewis was named one of the [[Big Six (activists)|\"Big Six\"]] leaders who were organizing the [[March on Washington]], the occasion of Dr. King's celebrated \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, along with [[Whitney Young]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[James Farmer]] and [[Roy Wilkins]]; Lewis was the youngest of the Big Six. Lewis also spoke at the March. Discussing the occasion, historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: \"At the great Washington March of 1963, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), John Lewis, speaking to the same enormous crowd that heard [[Martin Luther King]]'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, was prepared to ask the right question: 'Which side is the federal government on?' That sentence was eliminated from his speech by organizers of the March to avoid offending the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration]]. But Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had experienced, again and again, the strange passivity of the national government in the face of Southern violence.\"<ref name=FreedomAlbany>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|title=My Name Is Freedom Albany, Georgia|format=reprint|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|location=Boston|work=You Can't Be Neutral on A Moving Train |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/19990219104007/http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm|archivedate=February 19, 1999}}</ref> At 23 he was the youngest speaker that day and is the last remaining living speaker.<ref name=\"scholastic\">{{cite news|title=The Sixties|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Junior Scholastic]]|date=February 11, 1994|page=6<!--|accessdate=December 1, 2008-->}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Lewis 1964-04-16 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lewis in 1964]]\nIn 1964, Lewis coordinated SNCC's efforts for \"[[Mississippi Freedom Summer]],\" a campaign to register black voters across the South. The Freedom Summer was an attempt to expose college students from around the country to the perils of African-American life in the South. Lewis traveled the country encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people in Mississippi, the most recalcitrant state in the union, to register and vote. Lewis became nationally known during his prominent role in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when, on March 7, 1965 \u2013 a day that would become known as \"[[Selma to Montgomery marches#\"Bloody Sunday\" events|Bloody Sunday]]\" \u2013 Lewis and fellow activist [[Hosea Williams]] led over 600 marchers across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. At the end of the bridge, they were met by [[Alabama Highway Patrol|Alabama State Troopers]] who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged [[tear gas]] and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with night sticks. Lewis's skull was fractured, but he escaped across the bridge to [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]], the movement's headquarter church in Selma. Before Lewis could be taken to the hospital, he appeared before the television cameras calling on [[Lyndon B.

In all honesty, John, when did you become the doorkeeper at the entrance to the Civil Rights gate?

It has been protected under [[Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen]] (DO) legislation since 1994, prior to which it was traditionally known as ''Pic\u00f3n de Tresviso'' and ''Queso Pic\u00f3n de Bejes''. The designated area centers in the [[Li\u00e9bana]] valley and production is restricted to the municipalities of [[Potes]], [[Pesaguero]], [[Cabez\u00f3n de Li\u00e9bana]], [[Camale\u00f1o]], [[Cillorigo de Li\u00e9bana]], [[Pe\u00f1arrubia, Cantabria|Pe\u00f1arrubia]], [[Tresviso]] and [[Vega de Li\u00e9bana]].\n\n==Production==\nA mixture of [[cow]]'s, [[sheep]]'s and [[goat]]'s [[milk]] is used in its production (although not necessarily from Bejes or Tresviso). The [[curd]] is created using a precise dose of [[rennet]] and cut into [[hazelnut]]-sized pieces, which are then drained and allowed to dry. The curd pieces are placed loosely in the [[Molding (process)|mould]], allowing sufficient air to circulate and initiate the growth of [[penicillium]] spores. The cheese is then salted and left for an initial drying and curing period of between 12 and 18 days, at a temperature between {{convert|15|and|18|C|F}}. \n\nAlthough much of the process thus far may take place in modern industrial units, DO regulations stipulate that final maturity be achieved by further curing in a natural limestone cave, typical of the geology of the Li\u00e9bana region, for a minimum of two months.<ref name=mapa>[http://www.mapa.es/es/alimentacion/pags/Denominacion/queso_lacteo/picon_bejes_tresviso.htm Pi\u0107on-Bejes-Tresviso] {{in lang|es}} (dead link)</ref> Maturation in this cool, high-humidity environment develops the particular taste and [[brevibacterium]]-infested crust typical of many [[blue cheese]]s. <!-- Since brevibacterium contributes to human [[foot odour]],<ref>[http://www.wheatoncollege.edu/Quarterly/q2003fall/bacteria.html Betsy's Bacteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120091356/http://www.wheatoncollege.edu/Quarterly/q2003fall/bacteria.html |date=2005-01-20 }} ''Wheaton College Quarterly''</ref> it adds to the cheese's characteristic and complex aroma. -->\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe finished [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] cheese may be between {{convert|7|and|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and have a diameter of {{convert|15|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, weighing anything between {{convert|700|g|lbs|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.8|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}. The rind is thin and grey to yellow-green in colour.

It has been protected under [[Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen]] (DO) legislation since 1994, prior to which it was traditionally known as ''Pic\u00f3n de Tresviso'' and ''Queso Pic\u00f3n de Bejes''. The designated area centers in the [[Li\u00e9bana]] valley and production is restricted to the municipalities of [[Potes]], [[Pesaguero]], [[Cabez\u00f3n de Li\u00e9bana]], [[Camale\u00f1o]], [[Cillorigo de Li\u00e9bana]], [[Pe\u00f1arrubia, Cantabria|Pe\u00f1arrubia]], [[Tresviso]] and [[Vega de Li\u00e9bana]].\n\n==Production==\nA mixture of [[cow]]'s, [[sheep]]'s and [[goat]]'s [[milk]] is used in its production (although not necessarily from Bejes or Tresviso). The [[curd]] is created using a precise dose of [[rennet]] and cut into [[hazelnut]]-sized pieces, which are then drained and allowed to dry. The curd pieces are placed loosely in the [[mould]], allowing sufficient air to circulate and initiate the growth of [[penicillium]] spores. The cheese is then salted and left for an initial drying and curing period of between 12 and 18 days, at a temperature between {{convert|15|and|18|C|F}}. \n\nAlthough much of the process thus far may take place in modern industrial units, DO regulations stipulate that final maturity be achieved by further curing in a natural limestone cave, typical of the geology of the Li\u00e9bana region, for a minimum of two months.<ref name=mapa>[http://www.mapa.es/es/alimentacion/pags/Denominacion/queso_lacteo/picon_bejes_tresviso.htm Pi\u0107on-Bejes-Tresviso] {{in lang|es}} (dead link)</ref> Maturation in this cool, high-humidity environment develops the particular taste and [[brevibacterium]]-infested crust typical of many [[blue cheese]]s. <!-- Since brevibacterium contributes to human [[foot odour]],<ref>[http://www.wheatoncollege.edu/Quarterly/q2003fall/bacteria.html Betsy's Bacteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120091356/http://www.wheatoncollege.edu/Quarterly/q2003fall/bacteria.html |date=2005-01-20 }} ''Wheaton College Quarterly''</ref> it adds to the cheese's characteristic and complex aroma. -->\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe finished [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] cheese may be between {{convert|7|and|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and have a diameter of {{convert|15|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, weighing anything between {{convert|700|g|lbs|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.8|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}.
