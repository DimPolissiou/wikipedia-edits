{"title_page": "Mental disorders in film", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{synthesis|date=July 2011}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2008}}\n{{original research|date=July 2011}}\n{{disputed|date=August 2017}}\n}}\n\nMany [[film]]s have portrayed [[mental disorder]]s or have used them as backdrops for other themes. This is a list of some of those films, sorted by disorder, regardless of whether or not the disorder is portrayed accurately. For instance, though ''[[50 First Dates]]'' presents a case of [[anterograde amnesia]], the type depicted does not actually exist.  Also, of the \"[[mental disorders]]\" listed below, \"[[catatonia]]\", \"sadistic personality disorder\", and \"self-injury\"\u2014while referring to a [[medical sign]] or a harmful ''[[behavior]]''\u2014are ''not'' mental disorders recognized in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.\n\nOwing to the nature of [[drama]], extreme and florid manifestations of a given disorder tend to prevail over the more subtle manifestations typical of an average case. For example, persons with [[agoraphobia]] are generally portrayed in drama as recluses who never, or hardly ever, venture from their homes; in reality, this is rare and extreme, not typical of [[agoraphobe]]s.\n\n==[[Agoraphobia]]==\n*''[[What About Bob?]]'' -1991- Character of Bob Wiley played by [[Bill Murray]] <ref>https://prezi.com/zl2lsee6wy3u/what-about-bob-a-psychological-analysis/</ref>\n*''[[Copycat (film)]]'' -

This is a list of some of those films, sorted by disorder, regardless of whether or not the disorder is portrayed accurately. For instance, though ''[[50 First Dates]]'' presents a case of [[anterograde amnesia]], the type depicted does not actually exist.  Also, of the \"[[mental disorders]]\" listed below, \"[[catatonia]]\", \"sadistic personality disorder\", and \"self-injury\"\u2014while referring to a [[medical sign]] or a harmful ''[[behavior]]''\u2014are ''not'' mental disorders recognized in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.\n\nOwing to the nature of [[drama]], extreme and florid manifestations of a given disorder tend to prevail over the more subtle manifestations typical of an average case. For example, persons with [[agoraphobia]] are generally portrayed in drama as recluses who never, or hardly ever, venture from their homes; in reality, this is rare and extreme, not typical of [[agoraphobe]]s.\n\n==[[Agoraphobia]]==\n*''[[What About Bob?]]'' -1991- Character of Bob Wiley played by [[Bill Murray]] <ref>https://prezi.com/zl2lsee6wy3u/what-about-bob-a-psychological-analysis/</ref>\n*''[[Copycat (film)]]'' -

It serves as an epilogue to the 2013\u20132019 original series ''[[Steven Universe]]'' and its follow-up 2019 animated film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''. It premiered on December 7, 2019 and concluded on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe series focuses on the aftermath of the events of ''Steven Universe'', where humans and Gems coexist in harmony after the end of the war between the Crystal Gems and Homeworld. Without the threats of the Diamonds or corrupted Gems, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] must deal with the everyday challenges that still come with his now relatively peaceful life, and question his new life objectives.\n\nLike the original series, ''Steven Universe Future'' has been critically acclaimed, with the design, music, voice acting, characterization, and prominence of [[LGBT]] themes being similarly praised; ''Future'' has been singled out for addressing issues some had with the original series, for its unique choice of focusing on the aftermath of the main story's climax, and for promoting mental health awareness through its treatment of Steven's experience of [[psychological trauma]].\n\n==Premise and synopsis==\nThe series is set after the events of ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', which itself takes place two years after the ''Steven Universe'' series finale \"[[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|Change Your Mind]]\". In \"Change Your Mind\", teenage protagonist [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] persuaded the Diamonds, the rulers of the intergalactic Gem empire, to cease their abusive, imperialist ways, and to heal the monstrous corrupted Gems that had been menacing the planet Earth. Now, Steven and his friends and family, the Crystal Gems, have constructed Little Homeworld, a community on Earth where humans and Gems can live in harmony. Steven now dedicates his time to inviting Gems to come to Little Homeworld, and educating those who do on how to find their new place in the galaxy.\n\n''Steven Universe Future'' follows Steven's everyday life trying to help Gems find new purpose; it also depicts the disappointments he faces with his new life, including the realization that there are things he cannot fix, and his own feelings of aimlessness after successfully liberating the Gem empire. He confronts old foes who are looking for revenge, tries to master a new power that he doesn't fully understand, and is challenged to decide what he wants for his own future.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{see also|List of Steven Universe characters}}\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Zach Callison]] as [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]], Onion, Cactus Steven, and Jingle Singer\n* [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] as [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]\n* [[Michaela Dietz]] as [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], and other Quartz Gems\n* [[Deedee Magno Hall]] as [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]], Volleyball, Shell, Brandish, and other Pearls\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Tom Scharpling]] as Greg Universe\n* [[Grace Rolek]] as Connie Maheswaran\n* [[Charlyne Yi]] as Ruby, Eyeball, and other Rubies\n* [[Erica Luttrell]] as Sapphire\n* [[Shelby Rabara]] as Peridot\n* [[Jennifer Paz]] as Lapis Lazuli and other Lapises\n* Miriam Hyman as Bismuth\n* [[Kimberly Brooks]] as Jasper and other Quartz gems\n* [[Sarah Stiles]] as Spinel\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as White Diamond\n* [[Patti LuPone]] as Yellow Diamond\n* [[Lisa Hannigan]] as Blue Diamond\n* Michelle Maryk as Larimar\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Lion\n\n===Guest===\n* [[Uzo Aduba]] as Bismuth (\u201cBismuth Casual\u201d) and Khadijah\n* [[Matthew Moy]] as Lars Barriga\n* [[Kate Micucci]] as Sadie Miller\n* [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]] as Jenny Pizza\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Sour Cream\n* [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] as Priyanka Maheswaran\n* Lamar Abrams as Wy-Six, Jaime, and Daniel\n* [[Indya Moore]] as Shep\n* Johnny Hawkes as Rodrigo and Cookie Cat\n* [[Marieve Herington]] as Jasmine\n* Tahani Anderson as Patricia\n* [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] as Snowflake Obsidian\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Smoky Quartz\n* Alastair James as Rainbow Quartz 2.0\n* Shoniqua Shandai as Sunstone\n* [[Christine Pedi]] as Holly Blue Agate\n* Della Saba as Aquamarine\n* Larissa Gallagher as Bluebird Azurite\n* Chris Jai Alex as Drew the Dog and Announcer\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Kerry Moonbeam<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2020/03/20/steven-universe-future-rebecca-sugar-interview-mr-universe-fragments/|title=Steven Universe Future: Rebecca Sugar Talks \"Mr. Universe\" and \"Fragments\"|website=TV Shows|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n* [[Susan Egan]] as Pink Diamond (archive audio)\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to Rebecca Sugar, when she was notified in 2016 that ''Steven Universe'' would be canceled after the end of the fifth season, she prevailed upon Cartoon Network to allow her to produce the followup film, ''Steven Universe: The Movie''.

Like the original series and ''Steven Universe: The Movie'', the characterization, themes, animation, voice acting, music, and [[LGBT]] representation have been widely praised; ''Future'' in particular is praised for its new ways of exploring previously developed themes (in particular Steven's dedication to solve other characters' problems), and its unconventional choice of focusing on the smaller-scale aftermath of the main storyline. Reviewers have pointed out that it addresses issues several fans and reviewers had with the original series, such as its perceived tendency to solve characters' problems in overly simple ways and to redeem all antagonists.\n\nCaroline Cao of ''[[Slashfilm|/Film]]'' called ''Steven Universe Future'' \"a messy and beautiful tale of trauma, healing, and survival\", stating: \"Sugar and her team are the greatest visual maximalists in animation, pushing imageries to their most emotional and thematic extremes\u2014particularly through the inventiveness of the flexible Fusion metaphor\u2014and unraveling difficult revelations about surviving trauma.\" She praised the exploration of Steven's tendency to help other people with their problems, claiming that \"Steven faces the reoccurring lesson of 'biting more than you can chew.' Steven wants to heal everyone, anything, but falls short, and even unleashes destruction at times. As Future moves forward, Steven will contend with his own management of the new world order he has created, and his mother\u2019s past will continue to haunt his future. Then there's the matter of Steven's newest Gem power that manifests through his rage and insecurities. ''Steven Universe Future'' is on a roll in delivering hard and relevant messages about victimhood and survivorhood solidarity.

It wasn't just that she was inexperienced, but rather she was inexperienced, dangerous, and all too capable of letting her powers run wild in ways that would actively harm others.

There are Gems like Spinel who have all the reasons in the galaxy to hate Pink, but that's not really where any of the people in the series are coming from.

It serves as an epilogue to the 2013\u20132019 original series ''[[Steven Universe]]'' and its follow-up 2019 animated film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''. It premiered on December 7, 2019 and concluded on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe series focuses on the aftermath of the events of ''Steven Universe'', where humans and Gems coexist in harmony after the end of the war between the Crystal Gems and Homeworld. Without the threats of the Diamonds or corrupted Gems, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] must deal with the everyday challenges that still come with his now relatively peaceful life, and question his new life objectives.\n\nLike the original series, ''Steven Universe Future'' has been critically acclaimed, with the design, music, voice acting, characterization, and prominence of [[LGBT]] themes being similarly praised; ''Future'' has been singled out for addressing issues some had with the original series, for its unique choice of focusing on the aftermath of the main story's climax, and for promoting mental health awareness through its treatment of Steven's experience of [[psychological trauma]].\n\n==Premise and synopsis==\nThe series is set after the events of ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', which itself takes place two years after the ''Steven Universe'' series finale \"[[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|Change Your Mind]]\". In \"Change Your Mind\", teenage protagonist [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] persuaded the Diamonds, the rulers of the intergalactic Gem empire, to cease their abusive, imperialist ways, and to heal the monstrous corrupted Gems that had been menacing the planet Earth. Now, Steven and his friends and family, the Crystal Gems, have constructed Little Homeworld, a community on Earth where humans and Gems can live in harmony. Steven now dedicates his time to inviting Gems to come to Little Homeworld, and educating those who do on how to find their new place in the galaxy.\n\n''Steven Universe Future'' follows Steven's everyday life trying to help Gems find new purpose; it also depicts the disappointments he faces with his new life, including the realization that there are things he cannot fix, and his own feelings of aimlessness after successfully liberating the Gem empire. He confronts old foes who are looking for revenge, tries to master a new power that he doesn't fully understand, and is challenged to decide what he wants for his own future.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{see also|List of Steven Universe characters}}\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Zach Callison]] as [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]], Onion, Cactus Steven, and Jingle Singer\n* [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] as [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]\n* [[Michaela Dietz]] as [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], and other Quartz Gems\n* [[Deedee Magno Hall]] as [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]], Volleyball, Shell, Brandish, and other Pearls\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Tom Scharpling]] as Greg Universe\n* [[Grace Rolek]] as Connie Maheswaran\n* [[Charlyne Yi]] as Ruby, Eyeball, and other Rubies\n* [[Erica Luttrell]] as Sapphire\n* [[Shelby Rabara]] as Peridot\n* [[Jennifer Paz]] as Lapis Lazuli and other Lapises\n* Miriam Hyman as Bismuth\n* [[Kimberly Brooks]] as Jasper and other Quartz gems\n* [[Sarah Stiles]] as Spinel\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as White Diamond\n* [[Patti LuPone]] as Yellow Diamond\n* [[Lisa Hannigan]] as Blue Diamond\n* Michelle Maryk as Larimar\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Lion\n\n===Guest===\n* [[Uzo Aduba]] as Bismuth (\u201cBismuth Casual\u201d) and Khadijah\n* [[Matthew Moy]] as Lars Barriga\n* [[Kate Micucci]] as Sadie Miller\n* [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]] as Jenny Pizza\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Sour Cream\n* [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] as Priyanka Maheswaran\n* Lamar Abrams as Wy-Six, Jaime, and Daniel\n* [[Indya Moore]] as Shep\n* Johnny Hawkes as Rodrigo and Cookie Cat\n* [[Marieve Herington]] as Jasmine\n* Tahani Anderson as Patricia\n* [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] as Snowflake Obsidian\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Smoky Quartz\n* Alastair James as Rainbow Quartz 2.0\n* Shoniqua Shandai as Sunstone\n* [[Christine Pedi]] as Holly Blue Agate\n* Della Saba as Aquamarine\n* Larissa Gallagher as Bluebird Azurite\n* Chris Jai Alex as Drew the Dog and Announcer\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Kerry Moonbeam<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2020/03/20/steven-universe-future-rebecca-sugar-interview-mr-universe-fragments/|title=Steven Universe Future: Rebecca Sugar Talks \"Mr. Universe\" and \"Fragments\"|website=TV Shows|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n* [[Susan Egan]] as Pink Diamond (archive audio)\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to Rebecca Sugar, when she was notified in 2016 that ''Steven Universe'' would be canceled after the end of the fifth season, she prevailed upon Cartoon Network to allow her to produce the followup film, ''Steven Universe: The Movie''.

Like the original series and ''Steven Universe: The Movie'', the characterization, themes, animation, voice acting, music, and [[LGBT]] representation have been widely praised; ''Future'' in particular is praised for its new ways of exploring previously developed themes (in particular Steven's dedication to solve other characters' problems), and its unconventional choice of focusing on the smaller-scale aftermath of the main storyline. Reviewers have pointed out that it addresses issues several fans and reviewers had with the original series, such as its perceived tendency to solve characters' problems in overly simple ways and to redeem all antagonists.\n\nCaroline Cao of ''[[Slashfilm|/Film]]'' called ''Steven Universe Future'' \"a messy and beautiful tale of trauma, healing, and survival\", stating: \"Sugar and her team are the greatest visual maximalists in animation, pushing imageries to their most emotional and thematic extremes\u2014particularly through the inventiveness of the flexible Fusion metaphor\u2014and unraveling difficult revelations about surviving trauma.\" She praised the exploration of Steven's tendency to help other people with their problems, claiming that \"Steven faces the reoccurring lesson of 'biting more than you can chew.' Steven wants to heal everyone, anything, but falls short, and even unleashes destruction at times. As Future moves forward, Steven will contend with his own management of the new world order he has created, and his mother\u2019s past will continue to haunt his future. Then there's the matter of Steven's newest Gem power that manifests through his rage and insecurities. ''Steven Universe Future'' is on a roll in delivering hard and relevant messages about victimhood and survivorhood solidarity.

According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of \"selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production\".<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\">[Carlson, N. (2013). Human Communication. In Physiology of behavior (11th ed., pp. 497\u2013500). Boston: Allyn and Bacon.]</ref> For many people who stutter, repetition is the main problem. The term \"stuttering\" covers a wide range of severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe [[symptoms]] that effectively prevent [[oral communication]]. In the world, approximately four times as many men as women stutter, encompassing 70 million people worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|title=11 Facts About Stuttering|url=https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-stuttering|access-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719081755/https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-stuttering|archive-date=19 July 2014|df=}}</ref> or about 1% of the world's population.<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\"/>\n\nThe impact of stuttering on a person's functioning and emotional state can be severe. This may include fears of having to [[elocution|enunciate]] specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying (especially in children), having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering, or a feeling of \"loss of control\" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is actually no direct correlation in that direction (though as mentioned the inverse can be true, as social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|title=What is the relationship between stuttering and anxiety? {{!}} British Stammering Association|website=www.stammering.org|access-date=2019-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423073752/http://stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|archive-date=2017-04-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress are not thought to cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and high [[Allostatic load|allostatic stress load]] (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, worsening the problem in the manner of a [[positive feedback]] system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition.<ref>http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208102736/http://stutteredspeechsyndrome.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=M.|editor1-first=J.|editor1-last=Au-Yeung|editor2-first=M.

Stutterers often find that their stuttering fluctuates and that they have \"good\" days, \"bad\" days and \"stutter-free\" days.

People who stutter may experience varying disfluency.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />  Tasks that trigger disfluency usually require a controlled-language processing, which involves linguistic planning. In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing \"Happy Birthday\" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter.  Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, \"controlled\" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02547-2 |pmid=10981883|last=Sandak|first=R|title=Stuttering: a view from neuroimaging|volume=356|issue=9228|journal=The Lancet|pages=445\u2013446|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nNo single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple factors contributing to stuttering.<ref name=\"gordon\"/> Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis.<ref name=\"Guitar5\u20136\">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp= 5\u20136}}</ref> Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 11}}</ref> However, [[Twin study|twin]] and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur,<ref name=\"Guitar66\">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 66}}</ref> and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.<ref>{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 39}}</ref>\nThere is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech, language, learning or motor difficulties.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 12}}</ref> Robert West, a pioneer of genetic studies in stuttering, has suggested that the presence of stuttering is connected to the fact that articulated speech is the last major acquisition in human evolution.<ref name=\"west\">{{cite journal |last1=West | first1=R.|last2=Nelson|first2=S.|last3=Berry|first3=M.|year = 1939 |title =  The heredity of stuttering |journal= Quarterly Journal of Speech |issue=1 |pages=23\u201330 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/00335633909380434 |volume=25}}</ref>\n\nAnother view is that a stutter (stammer) is a '''complex tic'''. This view is held for the following reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension \u2013 an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3\u20134 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis]] is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more [[cortisol]] than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.<ref>Stammering (Stuttering) A Complex Vocal Tic, Patricia Sims, Kindle version 2014</ref>\n\nIn a 2010 article, three genes were found by [[Dennis Drayna]] and team to correlate with stuttering: [[GNPTAB]], [[GNPTG]], and [[NAGPA]].

Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.<ref name=\"watkins\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins KE, Smith SM, Davis S, Howell P |title=Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=50\u20139 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17928317 |pmc=2492392 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm241}}</ref><ref name=\"chang\">{{cite journal |author= Soo-Eun, Chang|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=[[NeuroImage (journal)|NeuroImage]] |year=2007 |ref= harv }}</ref>\n\nAuditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 46\u20137}}</ref> and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by [[Auditory masking|masking]], [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 58}}</ref> There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.<ref name=\"gordon\"/>\n\nThere is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 43}}</ref> Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"Guitar66\"/>\n\nThe ''capacities and demands'' model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the ''capacity'' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the ''demands'' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] or inadequate language skills or external factors such as [[peer pressure]], time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 16\u201321}}</ref> However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n===Physiology===\nThough neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter. Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering.  In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults. However, the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering.<ref name=watkins />\n\nStudies utilizing [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show [[hypoactivity]] in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as [[Broca's area]], but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />  One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A handbook on stuttering|last=Bloodstein|first=Oliver|last2=Ratner|first2=Nan Bernstein|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=978-1418042035|location=|pages=142}}</ref>\n\n[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />\n\nResearchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).

As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual's background, through a case history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/neurogenic-stuttering|title=Neurogenic Stuttering|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref> Information from both sources should consider things such as age, the various times it has occurred, and other impediments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/stuttering|title=Stuttering|date=2015-08-18|website=NIDCD|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520055057/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/stuttering|archive-date=2018-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child).

In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Disfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (''Riley\u2019s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)'').<ref name=\"cirrie.buffalo.edu\"/> They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course.

Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers\u2019 self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker's experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).<ref>[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/health/downloads/star-stutteringresource.pdfLa Trobe University School of Human Communication Disorders]</ref>\n\nThe SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client's case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client.\n\nStuttering can also diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.</ref> by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise.  The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as \"Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\" for developmental stuttering, and \"Adult-onset Fluency Disorder\".  However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \"fluency\" and \"disfluency\".\n\n===Normal disfluency===\n{{Main|Developmental dysfluency}}\nNormal disfluency should be ruled out before diagnosing stuttering.<ref>Ambrose, Nicoline Grinager, and Ehud Yairi. \"Normative Disfluency Data for Early Childhood Stuttering.\" ''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research'' 42, no. 4 (1999): 895-909. https://doi.org/10.1044/jslhr.4204.895 (\"Stuttering is shown to be qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from normal disfluency even at the earliest stages of stuttering.\")</ref> Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter after the preschool years, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as ''normal disfluency'' or ''developmental dysfluency''. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Young children learning to talk exhibit brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, this normal dysfluency gradually dissipates as the child matures.\n\n===Classification===\nDevelopmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.\n\nOther disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include [[autism]], [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[palilalia]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[selective mutism]], and [[social anxiety]].\n\n====Developmental====\nStuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278\u201381 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 |doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"craig2005\">{{cite journal|author1= Craig, A.|author2= Tran, Y.|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech\u2013Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201346 |year=2005 |ref= harv |doi= 10.1080/14417040500055060}}</ref> The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.<ref name=\"fn 30\"/> Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.<ref name=\"Ward13\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=13}}</ref> Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=114\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThough the rate of early recovery is very high,<ref name=\"gordon\"/> with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter. Recommendations to \"slow down\", \"take a breath\", \"say it again\", etc., may increase the child's anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the \"cycle of stuttering,\" to yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 13, 115}}</ref> With time secondary stuttering, including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements, may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers. With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 115\u2013116}}</ref> Other, rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 117\u2013119}}</ref> The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\"/>\n\n=====Neurogenic stuttering=====\nStuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\"/>\n\n====Acquired stuttering====\nIn rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote decreasing disfluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"craig2005\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332\u2013335}}</ref>\n\nPsychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332, 335\u2013337}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n{{main|Stuttering therapy}}\nBefore beginning treatment, an assessment is needed, as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131120151347/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |archive-date=2013-11-20 |df= }}</ref>\nWhile there is no complete cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often caused by stuttering, and consequently worsens stuttering symptoms.<ref name=\"nidcd.nih.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/stutter.aspx#treated |title=Stuttering |publisher=Nidcd.nih.gov |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404214740/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/Pages/stutter.aspx#treated |archive-date=2014-04-04 |df= }}</ref> This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-06-16 |title=Stuttering |accessdate=2014-05-12 }}</ref> Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|title=ASHA \u2013 Treatment Efficacy for Stuttering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSpeech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively. \"Follow-up\" or \"maintenance\" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016041011/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |archive-date=2009-10-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Fluency shaping therapy===\nFluency shaping therapy, also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\", or \"connected speech\", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 257}}</ref>\n\nPeople who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 257\u201367}}</ref>\n\n===Modification therapy===\nThe goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 253}}</ref> The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease.

These medications are FDA approved in the United States and hold similar approval in most countries for other conditions and their safety profiles are well established in these disorders.\n\nThe best studied medication in stuttering is olanzapine whose effectiveness has been established in replicated trials. Olanzapine acts as a dopamine antagonist to D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, and works similarly on serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex.<ref>Thomas, K., & Saadabadi, A. (2018).

An open label study of ecopipam in adults demonstrated significantly improved stuttering symptoms with no reports of parkinsonian-like movement disorders or tardive dyskinesia which can be seen with D2 antagonists.<ref name=\":2\">Maguire, G.A., Lasalle L., Hoffmeyer D., Nelson M., Lochead J.D., Davis K., Burris A., Yaruss J.S., \"Ecopipam as a pharmacologic treatment of stuttering.\" ''Ann Clin Psychiatry'' (2019 Aug), 31(3), 164-168.</ref> In addition, ecopipam had no reported weight gain, but instead has been reported to lead to weight loss.<ref name=\":2\" /> In a preliminary study, it was well tolerated in subjects, effectively reduced stuttering severity, and was even associated in a short-term study with improved quality of life in persons who stutter.<ref name=\":2\" /> Further research is still warranted, but this novel mechanism is showing promise in the pharmacologic treatment of stuttering.\n\nOne should always consult with a medical doctor before considering medication treatment of stuttering to review potential risks and benefits.\n\n===Support===\nWith existing behavioral and prosthetic treatments providing limited relief and pharmacologic treatments in need of FDA approval for widespread use, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support from professionals and people who stutter.

Research attempting to correlate stuttering with generalized or state anxiety, personality profiles, trauma history, or decreased IQ have failed to find adequate empirical support for any of these claims.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe lifetime [[prevalence]], or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%,<ref name=\"Mansson2000\">{{cite journal|author= Mansson, H.|year=2000|title=Childhood stuttering: Incidence and development|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47\u201357|doi=10.1016/S0094-730X(99)00023-6|ref= harv}}</ref> and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females.<ref name=\"craig2005\"/><ref name=\"Yairi96\">{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E |author2=Ambrose, N |author3=Cox, N|year=1996|title=Genetics of stuttering: a critical review|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|volume= 39|issue=4 |pages=771\u2013784|ref= harv|doi=10.1044/jshr.3904.771|pmid=8844557 }}</ref><ref name=\"fn 28\">{{cite journal |author=Kloth, S |author2=Janssen, P |author3=Kraaimaat, F |author4=Brutten, G |year = 1995 |title = Speech-motor and linguistic skills of young people who stutter prior to onset |journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders |issue=2 |pages=157\u201370 | doi=10.1016/0094-730X(94)00022-L | volume = 20 |ref=harv|hdl=2066/21168 }}</ref> However, there is not much information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio.<ref name=\"stutteringhelp.org\"/> Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of children under the age of 5 stutter.<ref name=\"Proctor\"/><ref name=\"Yairi2005\"/> As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter.

Johnson claimed there were cultures where stuttering, and even the word \"stutterer\", were absent (for example, among some tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]). Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races<ref name=\"Guitar5\u20136\"/> at similar rates,<ref name=\"craig2005\"/> about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world.

[[Hieronymus Mercurialis]], writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and [[vomiting|purging]].

Others recommended shortening the [[uvula]] or removing the [[tonsil]]s. All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering.

George VI went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist [[Lionel Logue]], for his stammer. This is dealt with in the Academy Award-winning film ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010) in which [[Colin Firth]] plays George VI. The film is based on an original screenplay by [[David Seidler]] who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.\n\nAnother notable case was that of British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].

Considering that language and culture are relatively fluid factors in one's understanding and production of language, it makes sense that bilingualism can be an important feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.\n* The child is mixing vocabulary (code mixing) from both languages in one sentence. This is a normal process that helps the child increase his skills in the weaker language, but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|title=Stuttering and the Bilingual Child|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|access-date=2017-12-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926020934/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|archive-date=2017-09-26|df=}}</ref>\n* The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express his/her ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age.  Also, the child may make grammatical mistakes.  Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual, so development may be uneven between the two languages.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* Adding a second or third language between the ages of three and five years of age may cause stuttering to increase (become more severe).  However, this may be the case only when: (1) the child's first language is not strong and/or the child is experiencing difficulties in her first language, (2) One language is used more than the other or, (3) the child resists speaking the additional language.\nIt should also be noted that stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less of a problem depending on the individual case.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aAbPBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=bilingual+stuttering+wiki#v=onepage&q=bilingual%20stuttering%20wiki&f=false|title=Multilingual Aspects of Fluency Disorders|last=Howell|first=Peter|last2=Borsel|first2=John Van|date=2011|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781847693587}}</ref>\n\n==== Research ====\nMuch research is being conducted to look at the prevalence of stuttering in bilingual populations and the differences between languages.

This may include fears of having to [[elocution|enunciate]] specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying (especially in children), having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering, or a feeling of \"loss of control\" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is actually no direct correlation in that direction (though as mentioned the inverse can be true, as social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|title=What is the relationship between stuttering and anxiety? {{!}} British Stammering Association|website=www.stammering.org|access-date=2019-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423073752/http://stammering.org/speaking-out/articles/what-relationship-between-stuttering-and-anxiety|archive-date=2017-04-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress are not thought to cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and high [[Allostatic load|allostatic stress load]] (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, worsening the problem in the manner of a [[positive feedback]] system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition.<ref>http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208102736/http://stutteredspeechsyndrome.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=M.|editor1-first=J.|editor1-last=Au-Yeung|editor2-first=M.

In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing \"Happy Birthday\" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter.  Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, \"controlled\" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02547-2 |pmid=10981883|last=Sandak|first=R|title=Stuttering: a view from neuroimaging|volume=356|issue=9228|journal=The Lancet|pages=445\u2013446|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nNo single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple factors contributing to stuttering.<ref name=\"gordon\"/> Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis.<ref name=\"Guitar5\u20136\">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp= 5\u20136}}</ref> Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 11}}</ref> However, [[Twin study|twin]] and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur,<ref name=\"Guitar66\">{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 66}}</ref> and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.<ref>{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 39}}</ref>\nThere is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech, language, learning or motor difficulties.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 12}}</ref> Robert West, a pioneer of genetic studies in stuttering, has suggested that the presence of stuttering is connected to the fact that articulated speech is the last major acquisition in human evolution.<ref name=\"west\">{{cite journal |last1=West | first1=R.|last2=Nelson|first2=S.|last3=Berry|first3=M.|year = 1939 |title =  The heredity of stuttering |journal= Quarterly Journal of Speech |issue=1 |pages=23\u201330 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/00335633909380434 |volume=25}}</ref>\n\nAnother view is that a stutter (stammer) is a '''complex tic'''. This view is held for the following reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension \u2013 an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3\u20134 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis]] is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more [[cortisol]] than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.<ref>Stammering (Stuttering) A Complex Vocal Tic, Patricia Sims, Kindle version 2014</ref>\n\nIn a 2010 article, three genes were found by [[Dennis Drayna]] and team to correlate with stuttering: [[GNPTAB]], [[GNPTG]], and [[NAGPA]].

Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.<ref name=\"watkins\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins KE, Smith SM, Davis S, Howell P |title=Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=50\u20139 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17928317 |pmc=2492392 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm241}}</ref><ref name=\"chang\">{{cite journal |author= Soo-Eun, Chang|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=[[NeuroImage (journal)|NeuroImage]] |year=2007 |ref= harv }}</ref>\n\nAuditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 46\u20137}}</ref> and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by [[Auditory masking|masking]], [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 58}}</ref> There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.<ref name=\"gordon\"/>\n\nThere is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 43}}</ref> Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"Guitar66\"/>\n\nThe ''capacities and demands'' model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the ''capacity'' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the ''demands'' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] or inadequate language skills or external factors such as [[peer pressure]], time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 16\u201321}}</ref> However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n===Physiology===\nThough neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter. Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering.  In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults. However, the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering.<ref name=watkins />\n\nStudies utilizing [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show [[hypoactivity]] in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as [[Broca's area]], but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />  One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A handbook on stuttering|last=Bloodstein|first=Oliver|last2=Ratner|first2=Nan Bernstein|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=978-1418042035|location=|pages=142}}</ref>\n\n[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.<ref name=\"Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.\" />\n\nResearchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).

The corpus callosum, rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults. This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks.

In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Disfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (''Riley\u2019s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)'').<ref name=\"cirrie.buffalo.edu\"/> They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course.

Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers\u2019 self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker's experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).<ref>[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/health/downloads/star-stutteringresource.pdfLa Trobe University School of Human Communication Disorders]</ref>\n\nThe SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client's case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client.\n\nStuttering can also diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.</ref> by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise.  The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as \"Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\" for developmental stuttering, and \"Adult-onset Fluency Disorder\".  However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \"fluency\" and \"disfluency\".\n\n===Normal disfluency===\n{{Main|Developmental dysfluency}}\nNormal disfluency should be ruled out before diagnosing stuttering.<ref>Ambrose, Nicoline Grinager, and Ehud Yairi. \"Normative Disfluency Data for Early Childhood Stuttering.\" ''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research'' 42, no. 4 (1999): 895-909. https://doi.org/10.1044/jslhr.4204.895 (\"Stuttering is shown to be qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from normal disfluency even at the earliest stages of stuttering.\")</ref> Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter after the preschool years, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as ''normal disfluency'' or ''developmental dysfluency''. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Young children learning to talk exhibit brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, this normal dysfluency gradually dissipates as the child matures.\n\n===Classification===\nDevelopmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.\n\nOther disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include [[autism]], [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[palilalia]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[selective mutism]], and [[social anxiety]].\n\n====Developmental====\nStuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278\u201381 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 |doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"craig2005\">{{cite journal|author1= Craig, A.|author2= Tran, Y.|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech\u2013Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201346 |year=2005 |ref= harv |doi= 10.1080/14417040500055060}}</ref> The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.<ref name=\"fn 30\"/> Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.<ref name=\"Ward13\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=13}}</ref> Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=114\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThough the rate of early recovery is very high,<ref name=\"gordon\"/> with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.<ref name=\"Ward13\"/> Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter. Recommendations to \"slow down\", \"take a breath\", \"say it again\", etc., may increase the child's anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the \"cycle of stuttering,\" to yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 13, 115}}</ref> With time secondary stuttering, including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements, may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers. With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 115\u2013116}}</ref> Other, rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\">{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 117\u2013119}}</ref> The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours.<ref name=\"Ward 2006 pp= 117\u2013119\"/>\n\n=====Neurogenic stuttering=====\nStuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.<ref name=\"Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500\"/>\n\n====Acquired stuttering====\nIn rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote decreasing disfluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name=\"gordon\"/><ref name=\"craig2005\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332\u2013335}}</ref>\n\nPsychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332, 335\u2013337}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n{{main|Stuttering therapy}}\nBefore beginning treatment, an assessment is needed, as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131120151347/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |archive-date=2013-11-20 |df= }}</ref>\nWhile there is no complete cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often caused by stuttering, and consequently worsens stuttering symptoms.<ref name=\"nidcd.nih.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/stutter.aspx#treated |title=Stuttering |publisher=Nidcd.nih.gov |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404214740/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/Pages/stutter.aspx#treated |archive-date=2014-04-04 |df= }}</ref> This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-06-16 |title=Stuttering |accessdate=2014-05-12 }}</ref> Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|title=ASHA \u2013 Treatment Efficacy for Stuttering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSpeech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively. \"Follow-up\" or \"maintenance\" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016041011/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |archive-date=2009-10-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Fluency shaping therapy===\nFluency shaping therapy, also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\", or \"connected speech\", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 257}}</ref>\n\nPeople who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 257\u201367}}</ref>\n\n===Modification therapy===\nThe goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 253}}</ref> The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was published by [[Charles Van Riper]] in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 245}}</ref>  However, depending on the patient, speech therapy may be ineffective.<ref>[http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ Stuttering, Stammering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910233428/http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ |date=2012-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Electronic fluency device===\n{{main|Electronic fluency device}}\nAltered auditory feedback, so that people who stutter hear their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering.<ref name=\"bothe2007\">{{cite journal |author1=Bothe, A.&nbsp;K. |author2= Finn,&nbsp;P.|author3=Bramlett, R.&nbsp;E. |title=Pseudoscience and the SpeechEasy: Reply to Kalinowski, Saltuklaroglu, Stuart, and Guntupalli (2007)|journal= American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology |volume=16 |pages=77\u201383 |year=2007 |pmid=<!--none-->| doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2007/010) |ref=harv}} <!-- is the \"author reply\" in PMID 17329677 --></ref> Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the person who stutters' voice while talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback).

Although different classes of medications have been investigated, those with dopamine blocking activity have been shown in numerous trials to have positive effects on stuttering. These medications are FDA approved in the United States and hold similar approval in most countries for other conditions and their safety profiles are well established in these disorders.\n\nThe best studied medication in stuttering is olanzapine whose effectiveness has been established in replicated trials. Olanzapine acts as a dopamine antagonist to D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, and works similarly on serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex.<ref>Thomas, K., & Saadabadi, A. (2018). Olanzapine. In ''StatPearls [Internet]''. StatPearls Publishing.</ref> At doses between 2.5\u20135&nbsp;mg, olanzapine has been shown to be more effective than placebo at reducing stuttering symptoms, and may serve as a first-line pharmacological treatment for stuttering based on the preponderance of its efficacy data.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | author = Shaygannejad V., Khatoonabadi S.

All these medications as well as olanzapine can carry the potential risk of a long-term movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia.\n\nThe investigational compound, ecopipam is unique from other dopamine antagonists in that it acts on D1 receptors instead of D2, owing little, if any risk, of movement disorders. An open label study of ecopipam in adults demonstrated significantly improved stuttering symptoms with no reports of parkinsonian-like movement disorders or tardive dyskinesia which can be seen with D2 antagonists.<ref name=\":2\">Maguire, G.A., Lasalle L., Hoffmeyer D., Nelson M., Lochead J.D., Davis K., Burris A., Yaruss J.S., \"Ecopipam as a pharmacologic treatment of stuttering.\" ''Ann Clin Psychiatry'' (2019 Aug), 31(3), 164-168.</ref> In addition, ecopipam had no reported weight gain, but instead has been reported to lead to weight loss.<ref name=\":2\" /> In a preliminary study, it was well tolerated in subjects, effectively reduced stuttering severity, and was even associated in a short-term study with improved quality of life in persons who stutter.<ref name=\":2\" /> Further research is still warranted, but this novel mechanism is showing promise in the pharmacologic treatment of stuttering.\n\nOne should always consult with a medical doctor before considering medication treatment of stuttering to review potential risks and benefits.\n\n===Support===\nWith existing behavioral and prosthetic treatments providing limited relief and pharmacologic treatments in need of FDA approval for widespread use, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support from professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering.<ref name=\"nidcd.nih.gov\"/> One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods.

Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs.

Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that \"[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience...\"<ref name=\"fn 10\">{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | publisher=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | access-date=2005-04-05 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419061110/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | archive-date=2005-04-19 | df= }}</ref> However, those who knew Churchill and [http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/sharp/Churchill.htm commented] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him.

She also noted about one incident, \"'It\u2019s s-s-simply s-s-splendid,' he stuttered\u2014as he always did when excited.\" Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of ''The American Mercury'' (1942) that \"Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple\" and that \"born with a stutter and a [[lisp]], both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking.

Considering that language and culture are relatively fluid factors in one's understanding and production of language, it makes sense that bilingualism can be an important feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.\n* The child is mixing vocabulary (code mixing) from both languages in one sentence. This is a normal process that helps the child increase his skills in the weaker language, but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|title=Stuttering and the Bilingual Child|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|access-date=2017-12-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926020934/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|archive-date=2017-09-26|df=}}</ref>\n* The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express his/her ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age.  Also, the child may make grammatical mistakes.  Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual, so development may be uneven between the two languages.<ref name=\"Stuttering and the Bilingual Child\"/>\n* Adding a second or third language between the ages of three and five years of age may cause stuttering to increase (become more severe).  However, this may be the case only when: (1) the child's first language is not strong and/or the child is experiencing difficulties in her first language, (2) One language is used more than the other or, (3) the child resists speaking the additional language.\nIt should also be noted that stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less of a problem depending on the individual case.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aAbPBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=bilingual+stuttering+wiki#v=onepage&q=bilingual%20stuttering%20wiki&f=false|title=Multilingual Aspects of Fluency Disorders|last=Howell|first=Peter|last2=Borsel|first2=John Van|date=2011|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781847693587}}</ref>\n\n==== Research ====\nMuch research is being conducted to look at the prevalence of stuttering in bilingual populations and the differences between languages. For instance, one study concluded that bilingual children who spoke English and another language had an increased risk of stuttering and a lower chance of recovery from stuttering than monolingual speakers and speakers who spoke solely a language other than English.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=P|last2=Davis|first2=S|last3=Williams|first3=R|date=January 2009|title=The effects of bilingualism on stuttering during late childhood|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=94|issue=1|pages=42\u201346|doi=10.1136/adc.2007.134114|issn=0003-9888|pmc=2597689|pmid=18782846}}</ref> Another study, though methodologically weak, showed relatively indistinguishable percentages of monolingual and bilingual stutterers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Au-Yeung|first=James|last2=Howell|first2=Peter|last3=Davis|first3=Steve|last4=Charles|first4=Nicole|last5=Sackin|first5=Stevie|date=2000-09-01|title=UCL survey of bilingualism and stuttering|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255604350|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders - J FLUENCY DISORD|volume=25|issue=3|pages=246|doi=10.1016/S0094-730X(00)80321-6|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223215820/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255604350_UCL_survey_of_bilingualism_and_stuttering|archive-date=2017-12-23|df=}}</ref> Due to so much conflicting data, the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has been called enigmatic,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rachel Karniol|date=1992-10-01|title=Stuttering out of bilingualism|journal=First Language|volume=12|issue=36|pages=255\u2013283|doi=10.1177/014272379201203604|issn=0142-7237}}</ref> which can demonstrate the intricacies of the topic and encourages more research to be conducted in order to sway the belief of impact the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has.\n\n=== Stuttering in popular culture ===\n[[Jazz]] and [[Eurodance]] musician [[Scatman John]] wrote the song \"[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]\" to help children who stutter overcome adversity.

She loves to sing and dance. She tells Mehnga that she wanted to fall in love and then get married but got married as per her family's wishes. She asks him to pretend that they are strangers so that she can fulfill her fantasy now. Mehnga agrees even though he is clueless as to how to woo a girl. \nThey play this game and are happily living their life. <br>\nLaachi gets a chance to sing a song and make some money. Due to financial difficulties, she ends up singing and dancing with family's approval.  During that time, a famous singer Ajitpal Singh sees Laachi and signs her up with him. His mgmt company gets Laachi and Mehnga to sign a document that they are single so that Laachi-Ajitpal duo can become more famous. Laachi is star-struck by Ajitpal and agrees with whatever he suggests.
