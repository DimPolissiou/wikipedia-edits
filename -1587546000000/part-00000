From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised [[Herbert Spencer]]'s views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing.

The same year the equivalent results were presented by German mathematician [[Arthur Moritz Sch\u00f6nflies|Sch\u00f6nflies]]. Fedorov and Sch\u00f6nflies had been intensively discussing the subject during their work, so the results can be somehow considered as joint ones, though Sch\u00f6nflies noted Fedorov's priority for some major ideas.\n*He published his classic work ''The Theodolite Method in Mineralogy and Petrography'' in 1893.<ref name=\"Kunz\">Kunz, George Frederick and [[Edgar T. Wherry|Wherry, Edgar T.]] (3 June 1921) \"Russian Geologists\" ''Science'', new series, '''53''' (1379):  516\u2013517</ref>\n* In 1906 he published ''Perfektsionizm'' (Perfectionism), a work he had started in the late 1870s. From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised [[Herbert Spencer]]'s views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing. Thus Fyodorov criticised the notion that the constant and the stable are the supreme mission of life. Rather he claimed that life never finally achieves anything but always strives to achieve. For him this is where the true philosophy of nature is to be found.<ref name=\"Meniailov\">{{cite web |last1=Meniailov |first1=A. |title=Fyodorov (or Fedorov), Evgraf Stepanovich|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/fyodorov-or-fedorov-evgraf-stepanovich |website=www.encyclopedia.com |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n* ''Tsarstvo kristallov'' (Crystal Kingdom) was first published posthumously in 1920 and featured much of the work carried out by Fyodorov and his colleagues. during the previous of forty years.

In [[heraldry|heraldic]] language, it may be [[blazon]]ed ''[[Argent]], a saltire [[gules]]''. '''Saint Patrick's Flag''' (''Bratach Naomh P\u00e1draig'') is a [[flag]] composed of Saint Patrick's Saltire.\n\nThe red saltire's association with Saint Patrick dates from the 1780s, when the [[Order of Saint Patrick]] adopted it as an emblem. This was a British [[chivalric order]] established in 1783 by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].

The standard of the Protector consisted of this flag with his escutcheon of a white lion rampant on a black field placed in the centre. The harp, however, seemed quite out of place in this flag, and another was tried in which St. George was in the first and fourth, St. Andrew in the second, and the red saltire on white daringly placed in the third as representing Ireland. This was a most unsatisfactory arrangement for visibility at sea, and the old Union was reverted to, but as Ireland was not shown on it, a golden harp was placed in the centre, and at the Restoration the harp was removed and the flag became as it was at the death of Charles I. |last=Gordon |first=W.{{nbsp}}J. |others=Illustrated by W.{{nbsp}}J.

It lies within the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]], which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the [[City of London]] by the open space known as [[Tower Hill]]. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the ass whole] in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ([[Ranulf Flambard]]) until 1952 ([[Kray twins]]),<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/discoverthepalaces/FAQs#11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227072443/http://www.hrp.org.uk/discoverthepalaces/FAQs#11 |title=Tower of London Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Historic Royal Palaces]] |accessdate=2 December 2015 |archivedate=27 December 2013}}</ref> although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a [[moat]]. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings [[Richard I]], [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], and [[Edward I]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\n\nThe Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an [[armory (military)|armoury]], a [[treasury]], a [[menagerie]], the home of the [[Royal Mint]], a [[List of Keepers of the Records in the Tower of London|public record office]], and the home of the [[Crown Jewels of England]]. From the early 14th century until the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], a procession would be led from the Tower to [[Westminster Abbey]] on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the [[Constable of the Tower]] is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the [[Princes in the Tower]]. Under the [[Tudor period|Tudors]], the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.\n\nThe peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as [[Elizabeth I]] before she became queen, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], and [[Elizabeth Throckmorton]], were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \"[[wikt:sent to the Tower|sent to the Tower]]\". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious [[Tower Hill]] to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. [[Anthony Salvin]] and [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]] took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. \n\nIn the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during [[the Blitz]] was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, and operated by the [[Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House]], the property is cared for by the charity [[Historic Royal Palaces]] and is protected as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Mike Gatting on the Tower of London.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the Tower of London by [[Mike Gatting]]]]\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:Tower of London EN.png|300px|thumb|Plan of the Tower of London]]\nThe Tower was orientated with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] London, which archaeologist [[Alan Vince]] suggests was deliberate.<ref>{{harvnb|Vince|1990}} in {{harvnb|Creighton|2002|p=138}}</ref> It would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the River Thames.<ref>{{harvnb|Creighton|2002|p=138}}</ref> The castle is made up of three \"[[ward (fortification)|wards]]\", or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (1189\u20131199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285. \n\nThe castle encloses an area of almost {{convert|12|acre|abbr=off}} with a further {{convert|6|acre}} around the Tower of London constituting the [[Liberties of the Tower of London|Tower Liberties]] \u2013 land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=11}}</ref> The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13th century when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 32-33\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> Despite popular fiction, the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber, although the basement of the White Tower housed a [[rack (torture)|rack]] in later periods.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=39}}</ref> Tower [[Wharf]] was built on the bank of the Thames under Edward I and was expanded to its current size during the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] (1377\u20131399).<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=49}}</ref>\n\n===White Tower===\n{{Main|White Tower (Tower of London)}}\nThe White Tower is a [[keep]] (also known as a donjon), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord \u2013 in this case, the king or his representative.<ref>{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=163}}</ref> According to military historian Allen Brown, \"The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon ''par excellence''\".<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|p=15}}</ref> As one of the largest keeps in the [[Christendom|Christian world]],<ref name=\"Allen Brown 1976 44\"/> the White Tower has been described as \"the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe\".<ref name=\"I&P 16\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=16}}</ref>\n[[File:Whitetowerlondon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original entrance to the White Tower was at first-floor level]]\n\nThe White Tower, not including its projecting corner towers, measures {{convert|36|by|32|m}} at the base, and is {{convert|27|m|-1|abbr=on}} high at the southern battlements. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in [[Norman architecture|Norman]] keeps, was above ground, in this case on the south face, and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. It was probably during [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s reign (1154\u20131189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 20-21\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=19\u201323}}</ref> At the western corners of the building are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner there is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the [[apse]] of the chapel.  As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.<ref name=\"I&P 16\"/>\n\nThe main building material is [[Kent]]ish [[rag-stone]], although some local [[mudstone]] was also used. [[Caen stone]] was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with [[Portland stone]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th century, only two original \u2013 albeit restored \u2013 examples remain, in the south wall at the gallery level.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 22\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=22}}</ref>\n\nThe tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level.<ref name=\"Parnell 20\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=20}}</ref> As was typical of most keeps,<ref>{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=164}}</ref> the bottom floor was an [[undercroft]] used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] were replaced with brick counterparts.<ref name=\"Parnell 20\"/> The basement is lit through small slits.<ref name=\"I&P 16\"/>\n\n[[File:Wakefield Tower Chapel - Tower of London.jpg|thumb|St John's Chapel, inside the White Tower]]\nThe entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the [[Constable of the Tower]], [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The [[crypt]] of [[St John's Chapel, London|St John's Chapel]] occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, \"the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents\".<ref name=\"Parnell 20\"/>\n\nThe upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east{{spaced ndash}}both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall{{spaced ndash}}and St John's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th century, along with the present roof.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 20-21\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=17}}</ref> St John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls.<ref name=\"Parnell 20\"/> Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior.<ref name=\"ABC 12\"/> The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and [[stained glass]] windows that depicted the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Holy Trinity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Innermost ward===\nThe innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower, stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century [[Hen Domen]], the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 22\"/> The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as [[Windsor Castle]].<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 27\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=27}}</ref> Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers \u2013 located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river \u2013 began around 1220.<ref name=\"ABC 17\"/>{{refn|Wakefield Tower was originally called Blundeville Tower.<ref name=\"ABC 17\"/>|group=\"nb\"}} They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. \n\nThe earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A [[great hall]] existed in the south of the ward, between the two towers.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=28}}</ref> It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by Henry III at [[Winchester Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=31}}</ref> Near Wakefield Tower was a [[postern gate]] which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=65}}</ref> The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] moved to Martin Tower.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 67\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=67}}</ref>\n{{wideimage|Panoramic view from Tower of London cropped.jpg|800px|Interior of the innermost ward.

Beyond that can be seen Traitors' Gate.}}\n\n===Inner ward===\n{{See also|Church of St Peter ad Vincula}}\nThe inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward, effectively doubling the castle's size.<ref name=\"ABC 15-17\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=15\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=24}}</ref> Henry III created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 32-33\"/> Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 33\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=33}}</ref> Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] for the inner ward.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 10\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=10}}</ref> The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a [[gatehouse]], most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward I.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=42}}</ref> The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13 towers that stud the curtain wall. Clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 10\"/> While these towers provided positions from which [[enfilade and defilade|flanking fire]] could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making [[English longbow|longbows]], [[crossbow]]s, [[catapult]]s, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:London Tower (CherryX).jpg|300px|thumb|left|The south face of the Waterloo Block]]\n\nAs a result of Henry's expansion, [[St. Peter ad Vincula (London)|St Peter ad Vincula]], a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 33\"/> It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over \u00a3300<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=46}}</ref> and again by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 55\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=55}}</ref> Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames.

At the same time a [[bastion]] known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's northwest corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the northeast corner, was a later addition.

The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] in Paris.

For he [William] realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners\".<ref name=\"ABC 5\"/> At the time, London was the largest town in England; the foundation of [[Westminster Abbey]] and the old [[Westminster Palace#Old Palace|Palace of Westminster]] under [[Edward the Confessor]] had marked it as a centre of governance, and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement.<ref name=\"Wilson1\"/> The other two castles in London \u2013 [[Baynard's Castle]] and [[Montfichet's Castle]] \u2013 were established at the same time.<ref name=\"Wilson 2\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=2}}</ref> The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south-east corner of the Roman town walls, using them as prefabricated defences, with the [[River Thames]] providing additional protection from the south.<ref name=\"ABC 5\"/> This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber [[palisade]], and probably had accommodation suitable for William.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=5\u20139}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London White Tower.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The White Tower dates from the late 11th century.]]\nMost of the early Norman castles were built from timber, but by the end of the 11th century a few, including the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone.<ref name=\"Wilson 2\"/> Work on the White Tower \u2013 which gives the whole castle its name \u2013<ref name=\"Allen Brown 1976 44\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|p=44}}</ref> is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain.

Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records that in 1097 King [[William II of England|William II]] ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone as a replacement for the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 54\"/> The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles.<ref>{{harvnb|Creighton|2002|p=147}}</ref> The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 54\"/>\n\nThe death in 1135 of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the [[Empress Matilda]], just a few days after Henry's death [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]] arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a [[Constable of the Tower|Constable]], a post held at this time by [[Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]]. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the [[First Battle of Lincoln|Battle of Lincoln]]. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became \"the richest and most powerful man in England\".<ref name=\"Wilson 6-9\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=6\u20139}}</ref> When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]] (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower.<ref name=\"Wilson 6-9\"/> Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of [[Lord Mayor of London]] removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion==\nThe castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (1189\u20131199).<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=13}}</ref> The castle was extended under [[William Longchamp]], King Richard's [[Lord Chancellor]] and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade.

As Longchamp's main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London (Foto Hilarmont).jpg|400px|thumbnail|left|The Tower of London from [[The Shard]].

In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, [[Robert Fitzwalter]] led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the [[Magna Carta]].<ref name=\"Wilson 17-18\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> The king reneged on his promises of reform, leading to the outbreak of the [[First Barons' War]]. Even after the Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]], the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Henry III. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry III's supporters would prevail.<ref name=\"Wilson 17-18\"/>\n\nIn the 13th century, Kings [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272) and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1272\u20131307) extended the castle, essentially creating it as it stands today.<ref name=\"ABC 17\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=17}}</ref> Henry was disconnected from his barons, and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule. As a result, he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification; at the same time Henry was an [[wikt:aesthete|aesthete]] and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> From 1216 to 1227 nearly \u00a310,000 was spent on the Tower of London; in this period, only the work at Windsor Castle cost more (\u00a315,000). Most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 27\"/> The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower (from which it derives its name) began in 1240.<ref name=\"ABC 20\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=20}}</ref>\n\nBeginning around 1238, the castle was expanded to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through the reign of Henry III and into that of Edward I, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences.<ref name=\"ABC 20\"/> The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=21}}</ref> The expansion caused disruption locally and \u00a3166 was paid to [[St Katharine's by the Tower|St Katherine's Hospital]] and the prior of [[Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate|Holy Trinity]] in compensation.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nHenry III often held court at the Tower of London, and held parliament there on at least two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. Henry III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal [[Pope Adrian V|Ottobuon]] came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. [[Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford]], marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was \"not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner, much less of an ecclesiastic\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=24\u201327}}</ref> Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle. The Earl retreated, allowing the King control of the capital, and the Tower experienced peace for the rest of Henry's reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=27}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was rarely in London, Edward I undertook an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing \u00a321,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that spent on the castle during the whole of Henry III's reign.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 35\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=35}}</ref> Edward I was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the [[crusade]]s to bring innovations to castle building.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 35\"/> His [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|programme of castle building in Wales]] heralded the introduction of the widespread use of [[arrowslit]]s in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=84}}</ref> At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by Henry III and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure.

In 1323 [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer, Baron Mortimer]], was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer's men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King. \n\nOne of Mortimer's first acts on entering England in 1326 was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there.

In 1532, [[Thomas Cromwell]] spent \u00a33,593 on repairs and imported nearly 3,000 tons of Caen stone for the work.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 55\"/> Even so, this was not sufficient to bring the castle up to the standard of contemporary military fortifications which were designed to withstand powerful artillery.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=73}}</ref> Although the defences were repaired, the palace buildings were left in a state of neglect after Henry's death. Their condition was so poor that they were virtually uninhabitable.<ref name=\"I&P 51\"/> From 1547 onwards, the Tower of London was only used as a royal residence when its political and historic symbolism was considered useful, for instance each of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I]] briefly stayed at the Tower before their coronations.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=52}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, the Tower acquired an enduring reputation as a grim, forbidding prison. This had not always been the case. As a royal castle, it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons, however these were usually high-status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people. Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=10\u201311}}</ref> As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower \u2013 as would have been the case for any castle \u2013 there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a \"Prison for Soldiers\", was built to the north-west of the White Tower. The Tower's reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century romanticists.<ref name=\"I&P 91\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=91}}</ref> Although much of the Tower's reputation is exaggerated, the 16th and 17th centuries marked the castle's zenith as a prison, with many religious and political undesirables locked away.<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/> The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture, so it was not often used; between 1540 and 1640, the peak of imprisonment at the Tower, there were 48 recorded cases of the use of torture. The three most common forms used were the infamous [[Rack (torture)|rack]], the [[Scavenger's daughter]], and manacles.<ref name=\"I&P 92\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=92}}</ref> The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter, the Constable of the Tower; consequentially it was also known as the [[Duke of Exeter's daughter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Black|1927|p=345}}</ref> One of those tortured at the Tower was [[Guy Fawkes]], who was brought there on 6 November 1605; after torture he signed a full confession to the [[Gunpowder Plot]].<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/>\n\nAmong those held and executed at the Tower was [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/> Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 117\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=117}}</ref> The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]], where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while [[Walter Raleigh]] was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605.<ref name=\"I&P 92\"/> Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112 people were executed on the hill over 400 years.<ref name=\"I&P 94\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=94}}</ref> Before the 20th century, there had been seven executions within the castle on [[Tower Green]]; as was the case with [[Lady Jane Grey]], this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous.<ref name=\"I&P 94\"/> After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554,<ref>{{harvnb|Plowden|2004}}</ref> Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth I, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir [[Thomas Wyatt the Younger|Thomas Wyatt]] had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.<ref>{{harvnb|Collinson|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower Hill, 2006.jpg|right|thumb|The cobbled surface of [[Tower Hill]] to the north of the Tower of London.

The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=57}}</ref> The [[Board of Ordnance]] (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|Military Store Department]] of the [[War Office]]) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]] (where the recently closed [[Woolwich Dockyard]] was converted into a vast ordnance store).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref>\n\nPolitical tensions between [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's [[Trainband|Trained Bands]], a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]], the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir [[Conyers baronets|John Conyers]]. By the time the [[English Civil War]] broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=74}}</ref>\n\nThe last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned was Charles II in 1661. At the time, the castle's accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation.<ref name=\"I&P 54-55\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=54\u201355}}</ref> Under the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings]] the Tower's buildings were remodelled, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. Just over \u00a34,000 was spent in 1663 on building a new storehouse, now known as the New Armouries in the inner ward.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 64\"/> In the 17th century there were plans to enhance the Tower's defences in the style of the ''[[star fort|trace italienne]]'', however they were never acted on. Although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose-built quarters for soldiers (the \"Irish Barracks\") in 1670, the general accommodations were still in poor condition.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=76\u201377}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London, south, Buck brothers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An engraving of the Tower of London in 1737 by [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck]]]]\nWhen the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] ascended the throne, their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle \"would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege\".<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=78}}</ref> For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still an integral part of the castle's defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000 men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the [[Royal Fusiliers|Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=79\u201380}}</ref> The popularity of the [[Chartism|Chartist movement]] between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. It was the last major programme of fortification at the castle. Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=81}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First World War, eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the Tower for espionage.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Executions%20at%20the%20Tower.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705121450/http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Executions%20at%20the%20Tower.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2011 |title=Executions at The Tower of London |publisher=[[Historic Royal Palaces]] |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the Second World War, the Tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war. One such person was [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Adolf Hitler]]'s deputy, albeit just for four days in 1941. He was the last state prisoner to be held at the castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=123}}</ref> The last person to be executed at the Tower was German spy [[Josef Jakobs]] who was shot on 15 August 1941.<ref name=\"Sellers 179\">{{harvnb|Sellers|1997|p=179}}</ref> The executions for espionage during the wars took place in a prefabricated [[miniature rifle range]] which stood in the outer ward and was demolished in 1969.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=117\u2013118}}</ref> The Second World War also saw the last use of the Tower as a fortification.

It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it was one of the sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] also garner much interest, and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19th century, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 111\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=111}}</ref>\n\nOver the 18th and 19th centuries, the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished. Only the Wakefield and St Thomas's Towers survived.<ref name=\"I&P 54-55\"/> The 18th century marked an increasing interest in England's medieval past. One of the effects was the emergence of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. In the Tower's architecture, this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower. It featured elements of Gothic Revival architecture such as battlements. Other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the Waterloo Barracks were described as \"castellated Gothic of the 15th century\".<ref name=\"I&P 117\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=117}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=96}}</ref> Between 1845 and 1885 institutions such as the Mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites; many of the post-medieval structures left vacant were demolished. In 1855, the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office, which was gradually phased out of the castle. At the same time, there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London.<ref name=\"I&P 117\"/>\n\nPublic interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers, of whom the work of [[William Harrison Ainsworth]] was particularly influential. In ''[[The Tower of London (novel)|The Tower of London: A Historical Romance]]'' he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination.<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/> Ainsworth also played another role in the Tower's history, as he suggested that Beauchamp Tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of 16th- and 17th-century prisoners. Working on the suggestion, [[Anthony Salvin]] refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. Salvin was succeeded in the work by [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]]. When a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture Taylor would ruthlessly remove it; as a result, several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post-medieval internal decoration removed.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=118\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London main entrance, 2009.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the Tower of London. Today the castle is a popular tourist attraction.]]\nAlthough only one bomb fell on the Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during [[the Blitz]], high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.<ref name=\"I&P 124\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=124}}</ref>\n\nA [[1974 Tower of London bombing]] in the White Tower [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]] Room left one person dead and 41 injured.

The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy, and consequently was closely guarded. A new position for \"keeper of the jewels, armouries and other things\" was created,<ref name=\"Wilson 29\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=29}}</ref> which was well rewarded; in the reign of Edward III (1327\u20131377) the holder was paid 12d a day. The position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels, gold, and silver, and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers.<ref name=\"Wilson 29\"/>\n\nIn 1649, during the [[English Civil War]], the contents of the Jewel House were disposed of along with other royal properties, as decreed by Cromwell. Metal items were sent to the Mint to be melted down and re-used, and the crowns were \"totallie<!-- this is the spelling used by the original document--> broken and defaced\".<ref name=\"I&P 106\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=106}}</ref>\n\nWhen the monarchy was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] in 1660, the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://royalexhibitions.co.uk/crown-jewels-2/|title=British Crown Jewels \u2013 Royal Exhibitions|website=royalexhibitions.co.uk|access-date=23 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815165715/https://royalexhibitions.co.uk/crown-jewels-2/|archive-date=15 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings from the time of Charles I.

It lies within the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]], which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the [[City of London]] by the open space known as [[Tower Hill]]. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], which gives the entire castle its name, was built by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ([[Ranulf Flambard]]) until 1952 ([[Kray twins]]),<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/discoverthepalaces/FAQs#11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227072443/http://www.hrp.org.uk/discoverthepalaces/FAQs#11 |title=Tower of London Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Historic Royal Palaces]] |accessdate=2 December 2015 |archivedate=27 December 2013}}</ref> although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a [[moat]]. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings [[Richard I]], [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], and [[Edward I]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\n\nThe Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an [[armory (military)|armoury]], a [[treasury]], a [[menagerie]], the home of the [[Royal Mint]], a [[List of Keepers of the Records in the Tower of London|public record office]], and the home of the [[Crown Jewels of England]]. From the early 14th century until the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], a procession would be led from the Tower to [[Westminster Abbey]] on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the [[Constable of the Tower]] is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the [[Princes in the Tower]]. Under the [[Tudor period|Tudors]], the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.\n\nThe peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as [[Elizabeth I]] before she became queen, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], and [[Elizabeth Throckmorton]], were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \"[[wikt:sent to the Tower|sent to the Tower]]\". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious [[Tower Hill]] to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. [[Anthony Salvin]] and [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]] took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. \n\nIn the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during [[the Blitz]] was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, and operated by the [[Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House]], the property is cared for by the charity [[Historic Royal Palaces]] and is protected as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Mike Gatting on the Tower of London.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the Tower of London by [[Mike Gatting]]]]\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:Tower of London EN.png|300px|thumb|Plan of the Tower of London]]\nThe Tower was orientated with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] London, which archaeologist [[Alan Vince]] suggests was deliberate.<ref>{{harvnb|Vince|1990}} in {{harvnb|Creighton|2002|p=138}}</ref> It would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the River Thames.<ref>{{harvnb|Creighton|2002|p=138}}</ref> The castle is made up of three \"[[ward (fortification)|wards]]\", or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (1189\u20131199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285. \n\nThe castle encloses an area of almost {{convert|12|acre|abbr=off}} with a further {{convert|6|acre}} around the Tower of London constituting the [[Liberties of the Tower of London|Tower Liberties]] \u2013 land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=11}}</ref> The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13th century when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 32-33\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> Despite popular fiction, the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber, although the basement of the White Tower housed a [[rack (torture)|rack]] in later periods.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=39}}</ref> Tower [[Wharf]] was built on the bank of the Thames under Edward I and was expanded to its current size during the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] (1377\u20131399).<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=49}}</ref>\n\n===White Tower===\n{{Main|White Tower (Tower of London)}}\nThe White Tower is a [[keep]] (also known as a donjon), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord \u2013 in this case, the king or his representative.<ref>{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=163}}</ref> According to military historian Allen Brown, \"The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon ''par excellence''\".<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|p=15}}</ref> As one of the largest keeps in the [[Christendom|Christian world]],<ref name=\"Allen Brown 1976 44\"/> the White Tower has been described as \"the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe\".<ref name=\"I&P 16\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=16}}</ref>\n[[File:Whitetowerlondon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original entrance to the White Tower was at first-floor level]]\n\nThe White Tower, not including its projecting corner towers, measures {{convert|36|by|32|m}} at the base, and is {{convert|27|m|-1|abbr=on}} high at the southern battlements. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in [[Norman architecture|Norman]] keeps, was above ground, in this case on the south face, and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. It was probably during [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s reign (1154\u20131189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 20-21\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=19\u201323}}</ref> At the western corners of the building are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner there is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the [[apse]] of the chapel.  As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.<ref name=\"I&P 16\"/>\n\nThe main building material is [[Kent]]ish [[rag-stone]], although some local [[mudstone]] was also used. [[Caen stone]] was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with [[Portland stone]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th century, only two original \u2013 albeit restored \u2013 examples remain, in the south wall at the gallery level.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 22\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=22}}</ref>\n\nThe tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level.<ref name=\"Parnell 20\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=20}}</ref> As was typical of most keeps,<ref>{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=164}}</ref> the bottom floor was an [[undercroft]] used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] were replaced with brick counterparts.<ref name=\"Parnell 20\"/> The basement is lit through small slits.<ref name=\"I&P 16\"/>\n\n[[File:Wakefield Tower Chapel - Tower of London.jpg|thumb|St John's Chapel, inside the White Tower]]\nThe entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the [[Constable of the Tower]], [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The [[crypt]] of [[St John's Chapel, London|St John's Chapel]] occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, \"the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents\".<ref name=\"Parnell 20\"/>\n\nThe upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east{{spaced ndash}}both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall{{spaced ndash}}and St John's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th century, along with the present roof.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 20-21\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=17}}</ref> St John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls.<ref name=\"Parnell 20\"/> Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior.<ref name=\"ABC 12\"/> The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and [[stained glass]] windows that depicted the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Holy Trinity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Innermost ward===\nThe innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower, stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century [[Hen Domen]], the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 22\"/> The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as [[Windsor Castle]].<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 27\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=27}}</ref> Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers \u2013 located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river \u2013 began around 1220.<ref name=\"ABC 17\"/>{{refn|Wakefield Tower was originally called Blundeville Tower.<ref name=\"ABC 17\"/>|group=\"nb\"}} They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. \n\nThe earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A [[great hall]] existed in the south of the ward, between the two towers.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=28}}</ref> It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by Henry III at [[Winchester Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=31}}</ref> Near Wakefield Tower was a [[postern gate]] which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=65}}</ref> The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] moved to Martin Tower.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 67\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=67}}</ref>\n{{wideimage|Panoramic view from Tower of London cropped.jpg|800px|Interior of the innermost ward.

Beyond that can be seen Traitors' Gate.}}\n\n===Inner ward===\n{{See also|Church of St Peter ad Vincula}}\nThe inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward, effectively doubling the castle's size.<ref name=\"ABC 15-17\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=15\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=24}}</ref> Henry III created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 32-33\"/> Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 33\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=33}}</ref> Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] for the inner ward.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 10\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=10}}</ref> The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a [[gatehouse]], most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward I.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=42}}</ref> The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13 towers that stud the curtain wall. Clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 10\"/> While these towers provided positions from which [[enfilade and defilade|flanking fire]] could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making [[English longbow|longbows]], [[crossbow]]s, [[catapult]]s, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:London Tower (CherryX).jpg|300px|thumb|left|The south face of the Waterloo Block]]\n\nAs a result of Henry's expansion, [[St. Peter ad Vincula (London)|St Peter ad Vincula]], a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 33\"/> It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over \u00a3300<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=46}}</ref> and again by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 55\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=55}}</ref> Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a [[portcullis]] and gate.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=29}}</ref> The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the [[Princes in the Tower]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/Sightsandstories/Prisoners/Towers/BloodyTower.aspx |title=Bloody Tower |publisher=[[Historic Royal Palaces]] |accessdate=22 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428063720/http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/Sightsandstories/Prisoners/Towers/BloodyTower.aspx |archivedate=28 April 2010  }}</ref> Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 47\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=47}}</ref> During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=58}}</ref> The castle buildings were remodelled during the [[House of Stuart|Stuart period]], mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance.

The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details,<ref>{{NHLE|num=1242210|desc= Waterloo Block|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref> was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.hrp.org.uk/curators/historic-royal-patchworks/|title=Historic Royal\u2026 Patchworks?|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Outer ward===\n\nA third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a [[bastion]] known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's northwest corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the northeast corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall {{convert|15|m}} apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 35-37\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=35\u201337}}</ref> Blocked [[battlement]]s (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements).<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=43\u201344}}</ref> A new {{convert|50|m|adj=on}} moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits;<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=34}}</ref> it was originally {{convert|4.5|m}} deeper in the middle than it is today.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 35-37\"/> With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the southwest corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a [[barbican]],<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 40-41\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=40\u201341}}</ref> which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=36}}</ref> The Lion Tower itself no longer survives.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 40-41\"/> \n\nEdward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as [[Traitors' Gate]], it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] in Paris.

Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records that in 1097 King [[William II of England|William II]] ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone as a replacement for the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 54\"/> The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles.<ref>{{harvnb|Creighton|2002|p=147}}</ref> The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 54\"/>\n\nThe death in 1135 of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the [[Empress Matilda]], just a few days after Henry's death [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]] arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a [[Constable of the Tower|Constable]], a post held at this time by [[Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]]. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the [[First Battle of Lincoln|Battle of Lincoln]]. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became \"the richest and most powerful man in England\".<ref name=\"Wilson 6-9\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=6\u20139}}</ref> When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]] (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower.<ref name=\"Wilson 6-9\"/> Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of [[Lord Mayor of London]] removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion==\nThe castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (1189\u20131199).<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=13}}</ref> The castle was extended under [[William Longchamp]], King Richard's [[Lord Chancellor]] and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade.

As Longchamp's main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London (Foto Hilarmont).jpg|400px|thumbnail|left|The Tower of London from [[The Shard]].

In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, [[Robert Fitzwalter]] led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the [[Magna Carta]].<ref name=\"Wilson 17-18\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> The king reneged on his promises of reform, leading to the outbreak of the [[First Barons' War]]. Even after the Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]], the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Henry III. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry III's supporters would prevail.<ref name=\"Wilson 17-18\"/>\n\nIn the 13th century, Kings [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272) and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1272\u20131307) extended the castle, essentially creating it as it stands today.<ref name=\"ABC 17\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=17}}</ref> Henry was disconnected from his barons, and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule. As a result, he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification; at the same time Henry was an [[wikt:aesthete|aesthete]] and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> From 1216 to 1227 nearly \u00a310,000 was spent on the Tower of London; in this period, only the work at Windsor Castle cost more (\u00a315,000). Most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 27\"/> The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower (from which it derives its name) began in 1240.<ref name=\"ABC 20\">{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=20}}</ref>\n\nBeginning around 1238, the castle was expanded to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through the reign of Henry III and into that of Edward I, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences.<ref name=\"ABC 20\"/> The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=21}}</ref> The expansion caused disruption locally and \u00a3166 was paid to [[St Katharine's by the Tower|St Katherine's Hospital]] and the prior of [[Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate|Holy Trinity]] in compensation.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nHenry III often held court at the Tower of London, and held parliament there on at least two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. Henry III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal [[Pope Adrian V|Ottobuon]] came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. [[Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford]], marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was \"not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner, much less of an ecclesiastic\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=24\u201327}}</ref> Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle.

In 1323 [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer, Baron Mortimer]], was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer's men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King. \n\nOne of Mortimer's first acts on entering England in 1326 was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there. For four years he ruled while [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in the Tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=34, 42\u201343}}</ref> Under Edward III's rule (1312\u20131377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French.

Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|pp=10\u201311}}</ref> As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower \u2013 as would have been the case for any castle \u2013 there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a \"Prison for Soldiers\", was built to the north-west of the White Tower. The Tower's reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century romanticists.<ref name=\"I&P 91\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=91}}</ref> Although much of the Tower's reputation is exaggerated, the 16th and 17th centuries marked the castle's zenith as a prison, with many religious and political undesirables locked away.<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/> The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture, so it was not often used; between 1540 and 1640, the peak of imprisonment at the Tower, there were 48 recorded cases of the use of torture. The three most common forms used were the infamous [[Rack (torture)|rack]], the [[Scavenger's daughter]], and manacles.<ref name=\"I&P 92\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=92}}</ref> The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter, the Constable of the Tower; consequentially it was also known as the [[Duke of Exeter's daughter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Black|1927|p=345}}</ref> One of those tortured at the Tower was [[Guy Fawkes]], who was brought there on 6 November 1605; after torture he signed a full confession to the [[Gunpowder Plot]].<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/>\n\nAmong those held and executed at the Tower was [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/> Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 117\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=117}}</ref> The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]], where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while [[Walter Raleigh]] was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605.<ref name=\"I&P 92\"/> Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112 people were executed on the hill over 400 years.<ref name=\"I&P 94\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=94}}</ref> Before the 20th century, there had been seven executions within the castle on [[Tower Green]]; as was the case with [[Lady Jane Grey]], this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous.<ref name=\"I&P 94\"/> After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554,<ref>{{harvnb|Plowden|2004}}</ref> Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth I, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir [[Thomas Wyatt the Younger|Thomas Wyatt]] had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.<ref>{{harvnb|Collinson|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower Hill, 2006.jpg|right|thumb|The cobbled surface of [[Tower Hill]] to the north of the Tower of London.

The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=57}}</ref> The [[Board of Ordnance]] (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|Military Store Department]] of the [[War Office]]) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]] (where the recently closed [[Woolwich Dockyard]] was converted into a vast ordnance store).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref>\n\nPolitical tensions between [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's [[Trainband|Trained Bands]], a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]], the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir [[Conyers baronets|John Conyers]]. By the time the [[English Civil War]] broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=74}}</ref>\n\nThe last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned was Charles II in 1661. At the time, the castle's accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation.<ref name=\"I&P 54-55\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=54\u201355}}</ref> Under the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings]] the Tower's buildings were remodelled, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. Just over \u00a34,000 was spent in 1663 on building a new storehouse, now known as the New Armouries in the inner ward.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 64\"/> In the 17th century there were plans to enhance the Tower's defences in the style of the ''[[star fort|trace italienne]]'', however they were never acted on. Although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose-built quarters for soldiers (the \"Irish Barracks\") in 1670, the general accommodations were still in poor condition.<ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=76\u201377}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London, south, Buck brothers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An engraving of the Tower of London in 1737 by [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck]]]]\nWhen the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] ascended the throne, their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle \"would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege\".<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=78}}</ref> For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still an integral part of the castle's defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000 men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the [[Royal Fusiliers|Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=79\u201380}}</ref> The popularity of the [[Chartism|Chartist movement]] between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. It was the last major programme of fortification at the castle. Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=81}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First World War, eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the Tower for espionage.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Executions%20at%20the%20Tower.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705121450/http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Executions%20at%20the%20Tower.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2011 |title=Executions at The Tower of London |publisher=[[Historic Royal Palaces]] |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the Second World War, the Tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war.

It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it was one of the sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] also garner much interest, and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19th century, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year.<ref name=\"Parnell 1993 111\">{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=111}}</ref>\n\nOver the 18th and 19th centuries, the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished. Only the Wakefield and St Thomas's Towers survived.<ref name=\"I&P 54-55\"/> The 18th century marked an increasing interest in England's medieval past. One of the effects was the emergence of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. In the Tower's architecture, this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower. It featured elements of Gothic Revival architecture such as battlements. Other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the Waterloo Barracks were described as \"castellated Gothic of the 15th century\".<ref name=\"I&P 117\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=117}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=96}}</ref> Between 1845 and 1885 institutions such as the Mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites; many of the post-medieval structures left vacant were demolished. In 1855, the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office, which was gradually phased out of the castle. At the same time, there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London.<ref name=\"I&P 117\"/>\n\nPublic interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers, of whom the work of [[William Harrison Ainsworth]] was particularly influential. In ''[[The Tower of London (novel)|The Tower of London: A Historical Romance]]'' he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination.<ref name=\"I&P 91\"/> Ainsworth also played another role in the Tower's history, as he suggested that Beauchamp Tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of 16th- and 17th-century prisoners. Working on the suggestion, [[Anthony Salvin]] refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. Salvin was succeeded in the work by [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]]. When a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture Taylor would ruthlessly remove it; as a result, several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post-medieval internal decoration removed.<ref>{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=118\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of London main entrance, 2009.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the Tower of London.

On 23 September 1940, during [[the Blitz]], high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.<ref name=\"I&P 124\">{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=124}}</ref>\n\nA [[1974 Tower of London bombing]] in the White Tower [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]] Room left one person dead and 41 injured.

The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy, and consequently was closely guarded. A new position for \"keeper of the jewels, armouries and other things\" was created,<ref name=\"Wilson 29\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1998|p=29}}</ref> which was well rewarded; in the reign of Edward III (1327\u20131377) the holder was paid 12d a day.

To successfully navigate these dangerous times, the Region needs a political movement that envisions a decisive, new future: one that strives to build an inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous Kurdistan where human rights, individual liberties, women\u2019s rights, power sharing, economic development, tolerance, and compassion are society\u2019s guiding principles. That movement needs to be decisive in its support for these values, eschewing the systems of patronage that are so damaging to society.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kurdistan Region needs to undertake a brave new change, unafraid to take on the large and complicated problems that require constructive dialogue with the Iraqi government. The New Generation Movement can resolve the issues between Erbil and Baghdad and make the Iraqi Constitution for our citizens.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew Generation will do this in a way that empowers women and girls in political decision-making. Women and girls should not be used to decorate the table of politicians. Their role in decision-making must be equal to that of men. '<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis fifteen-year policy program put forward by the New Generation Movement requires harmony and stability to be successful. Ensuring peace and coexistence is central to this plan. Therefore, as a way of introduction, I would like to discuss these issues in greater detail.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nFirst, peace within the Kurdistan Region means creating an atmosphere of coexistence and tolerance that ensures a diverse and inclusive society between citizens of different ethnic and religious groups, all holding equal rights and responsibilities. We are all endowed with human rights that stem our common humanity and are not granted on the basis of religion, ethnicity, or gender. We are all citizens of Kurdistan or the people under our protection. The New Generation Movement serves all equally.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecond, in terms of maintaining peace in the disputed territories, no government or military force has been able to resolve the issue using force. The last one who attempted to do so was Saddam Hussein, who failed to impose his will on the area around Kirkuk or on the Kurdistan Region, even with one million fighters and armed men. Peace in this contested zone stems from a commitment to tolerance, political stability, and economic development. Kurds should respect all other ethnicities, religions, and sects in these areas. Providing good governance would demonstrate the positive benefit of living under the umbrella of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). If a referendum were to be held in the future, residents in the disputed areas would want to choose this government freely. Kurds should use a discourse of coexistence.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThird, in order to have a stable and progressive Kurdistan Region, we need a strong relationship between the Region and Iraq. Our Region stands to benefit from a peaceful, democratic Iraq and we should aim to build a mutually beneficial partnership with the government in Baghdad. War reached our region and thousands of this our sons and daughters became victims. The strategy of the New Generation is for the Region to have a strong and mutually beneficial relationship with a democratic Iraq, where both respect each other\u2019s institutions.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nFourth, New Generation believes that none of the three above-mentioned points can be realized if the Kurdistan Region does not have a good relationship with neighboring countries, especially Iran and Turkey. This relationship must be one based on mutual respect. The fate of the Kurdistan Region is linked to those countries. Successful development of the Region hinges of having positive trade relations and a stable security situation with them. When in power, New Generation will attempt to strengthen these relationships without surrendering any of its autonomy. In exchange, Iran and Turkey should respect the Kurdistan Region, its government, and its people and treat it as a sovereignty entity. Conducting regional relations in this manner is immeasurably preferable to that of the past and it will be the goal of New Generation to do so.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis fifteen-year plan of the New Generation Movement has been divided into three different phases for each sector: a one-year plan, a four-year plan, and a fifteen-year plan. We have attempted to be as detailed and open as possible, while recognizing that some of the finer points will change as we adapt to new circumstances. Nevertheless, the values inherent to this plan \u2013 transparency, good governance, accountability, and stability \u2013 will not change. As a new political force, we offer a vision that looks forward to a Kurdistan Region that is stable, progressive, and prosperous and ask the people of Kurdistan to help us meet that goal.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Arrest==\nNew Generation leader Shaswar Abdulwahid appeared in court in Sulaimani on 3 March 2019 and arrested after being summoned on charges related to Articles 229 and 434 of the Iraqi penal code.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/030320191|title=Sulaimani judge orders arrest of New Generation leader Abdulwahid|work=Rudaw|language=English|date=3 March 2019|accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> Shaswar had been previously arrested in 2017 for backing protests.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-protests-idUSKBN1ED1W1|title=Three people killed as protests turn violent again in Iraqi Kurdistan|work=Reuters|language=English|date=19 December 2017|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> He and his supporters have argued that these arrests were politically motivated, noting that he has had prominent companies, businesses, and TV channels since 2007 but was not never arrested until 2017 when he became an influential political player on the side of the opposition.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Kurdistan 2033, The New Generation Movement Strategy for a Developed Kurdistan|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=10 March 2020|accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\nOn 22 April 2019, the party's Supreme Council and two prominent members of the Iraqi Parliament, Rabun Maroof and Sarkawt Shamsulddin published a statement on [[Facebook]], which, among others, read \n'The New Generation has been shifted from a political movement different from the dominant political model to a political band in which all of its institutions and the important decision-making bodies have been marginalized.'\n\nThey also stated that the New Generation Movement 'no longer enjoys collective decision making'.

That movement needs to be decisive in its support for these values, eschewing the systems of patronage that are so damaging to society.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kurdistan Region needs to undertake a brave new change, unafraid to take on the large and complicated problems that require constructive dialogue with the Iraqi government. The New Generation Movement can resolve the issues between Erbil and Baghdad and make the Iraqi Constitution for our citizens.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew Generation will do this in a way that empowers women and girls in political decision-making. Women and girls should not be used to decorate the table of politicians. Their role in decision-making must be equal to that of men. '<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the spirit of transparency and openness, the New Generation Movement is making its policy goals public by releasing this detailed fifteen-year plan. Drawing on the expertise of numerous advisors, this plan outlines three phases of development for the most important parts of our society.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew Generation will work hard to become the largest party in the Region. For too long, the chaotic multi-party governments have divided the cake of government amongst themselves and, as a result, failed the people. This arrangement enables the old political forces to avoid taking for their own failures. New Generation seeks to form a majority government capable of implementing a cohesive, progressive policy agenda to end that practice. '<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the older parties, New Generation does not look for excuses for its failures or others to blame. It is committed to governing with accountability and transparency. Success or failure would be measured by the welfare of the citizens, not the fortunes of the movement\u2019s leadership. If we fail in that regard, we should not remain in power.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis fifteen-year policy program put forward by the New Generation Movement requires harmony and stability to be successful. Ensuring peace and coexistence is central to this plan. Therefore, as a way of introduction, I would like to discuss these issues in greater detail.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nFirst, peace within the Kurdistan Region means creating an atmosphere of coexistence and tolerance that ensures a diverse and inclusive society between citizens of different ethnic and religious groups, all holding equal rights and responsibilities. We are all endowed with human rights that stem our common humanity and are not granted on the basis of religion, ethnicity, or gender. We are all citizens of Kurdistan or the people under our protection. The New Generation Movement serves all equally.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA matter that has particular relevance for the Kurdistan Region is the historical tension between our political parties. While we all have strongly held beliefs and will firmly challenge each other on policy. Nevertheless, we are all also from this region and country. We should respect each other and ensure that our rivalry never reaches a point where we undermine our common identity or depend on external forces to resolve our differences. Developing the homeland is the first and foremost duty of us as citizens and as political parties. Maintaining peace within the borders of the Kurdistan Region is all of our responsibility, regardless of our partisan affiliation.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecond, in terms of maintaining peace in the disputed territories, no government or military force has been able to resolve the issue using force. The last one who attempted to do so was Saddam Hussein, who failed to impose his will on the area around Kirkuk or on the Kurdistan Region, even with one million fighters and armed men. Peace in this contested zone stems from a commitment to tolerance, political stability, and economic development. Kurds should respect all other ethnicities, religions, and sects in these areas. Providing good governance would demonstrate the positive benefit of living under the umbrella of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). If a referendum were to be held in the future, residents in the disputed areas would want to choose this government freely. Kurds should use a discourse of coexistence.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThird, in order to have a stable and progressive Kurdistan Region, we need a strong relationship between the Region and Iraq. Our Region stands to benefit from a peaceful, democratic Iraq and we should aim to build a mutually beneficial partnership with the government in Baghdad. War reached our region and thousands of this our sons and daughters became victims. The strategy of the New Generation is for the Region to have a strong and mutually beneficial relationship with a democratic Iraq, where both respect each other\u2019s institutions.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nFourth, New Generation believes that none of the three above-mentioned points can be realized if the Kurdistan Region does not have a good relationship with neighboring countries, especially Iran and Turkey. This relationship must be one based on mutual respect. The fate of the Kurdistan Region is linked to those countries. Successful development of the Region hinges of having positive trade relations and a stable security situation with them. When in power, New Generation will attempt to strengthen these relationships without surrendering any of its autonomy. In exchange, Iran and Turkey should respect the Kurdistan Region, its government, and its people and treat it as a sovereignty entity. Conducting regional relations in this manner is immeasurably preferable to that of the past and it will be the goal of New Generation to do so.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nPolitical stability and peace leads to economic development: It is an issue of primary importance for the New Generation. because without a strong economy, we cannot realize the true potential of the Kurdistan Region. In the following pages, we outline the policy program of the New Generation Movement. In it we address the issues of the economic well-being of the people and government, the health care and education of its citizens, the environment, and the peshmerga. Without a strong economy, we cannot effectively tackle these issues. Without a healthy, well-educated, verdant, and secure society, we cannot meet our economic potential.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis fifteen-year plan of the New Generation Movement has been divided into three different phases for each sector: a one-year plan, a four-year plan, and a fifteen-year plan. We have attempted to be as detailed and open as possible, while recognizing that some of the finer points will change as we adapt to new circumstances. Nevertheless, the values inherent to this plan \u2013 transparency, good governance, accountability, and stability \u2013 will not change. As a new political force, we offer a vision that looks forward to a Kurdistan Region that is stable, progressive, and prosperous and ask the people of Kurdistan to help us meet that goal.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrttv.com/En/about.aspx/|title=Founder|work=NRTTV|language=English|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\nOn 22 April 2019, the party's Supreme Council and two prominent members of the Iraqi Parliament, Rabun Maroof and Sarkawt Shamsulddin published a statement on [[Facebook]], which, among others, read \n'The New Generation has been shifted from a political movement different from the dominant political model to a political band in which all of its institutions and the important decision-making bodies have been marginalized.'\n\nThey also stated that the New Generation Movement 'no longer enjoys collective decision making'.

The Volkswagen series of advertisements (which included the 1959 \"[[Think Small]]\" ad) were voted the No. 1 campaign of all time in ''[[Advertising Age]]''{{'}}s 1999 ''The Century of Advertising''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weshow.com/top10/en/advertising/top-10-best-american-advertising-campaigns-of-the-20th-century |title=Top 10 Best American Advertising Campaigns of the 20th Century15Aug08 |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=13 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013104509/http://www.weshow.com/top10/en/advertising/top-10-best-american-advertising-campaigns-of-the-20th-century |archivedate=13 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of \"Think Small\", the advertisement titled \"Lemon\" left a lasting legacy in America\u2014use of the word \"Lemon\" to describe poor quality cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=TOP 100 ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS OF THE CENTURY|url=http://adage.com/century/campaigns.html|publisher=Ad Age}}</ref> \"Lemon\" campaign introduced a famous tagline \"We pluck the lemons, you get the plums.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Break the rules|url=http://blog.asmartbear.com/breaking-the-rules.html}}</ref>\n\n===Fahrvergn\u00fcgen===\n'''''Fahrvergn\u00fcgen''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8fa\u02d0\u0250\u032ff\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02cc\u0261ny\u02d0\u0261n\u0329}}) ({{Audio|GT Fahrvergn\u00fcgen 2.ogg|listen}}) was an [[advertising]] slogan used by the German automobile manufacturer [[Volkswagen]] in a 1990 U.S. [[ad campaign]] that included a [[stick figure]] driving a Volkswagen car.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/gazette/access/246672631.html?dids=246672631:246672631&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+23%2C+1991&author=Stories+by+Debbie+Warhola&pub=Colorado+Springs+Gazette&desc=FAHRVERGNUGEN+%2F+Volkswagen%27s+concept+strategy&pqatl=google|title=FAHRVERGNUGEN / Volkswagen's concept strategy|last=Warhola|first=Debbie|date=23 August 1991|work=Colorado Springs Gazette|pages=G1|accessdate=28 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\n\"Fahrvergn\u00fcgen\" means \"driving enjoyment\" (from ''fahren'', \"to drive,\" and ''Vergn\u00fcgen'', \"enjoyment\"). The term itself is not standard German but a [[neologism]] (compound noun) created especially for this advertising campaign. One of the tag lines incorporating the word was: \"Fahrvergn\u00fcgen: It's what makes a car a Volkswagen\".\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nIn episode 3, Season 1 of ''[[Mad Men]]'', \"[[Marriage of Figaro (Mad Men)|Marriage of Figaro]]\", [[Don Draper]] and his associates discuss the \"Lemon\" advertisement at the beginning of the day. Draper is not amused at the ad but nevertheless concedes that it has retained their attention despite appearing in a copy of ''[[Playboy]]''. [[Roger Sterling]], his associate, scoffs. Sterling acknowledges the role Volkswagen will play in Germany's new industrialization initiative.\n\nIn season 17, episode 7 of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', hosts [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and [[James May]] were tasked with creating a commercial for Volkswagen's new Scirocco diesel in the style of Volkswagen's advertising. The hosts created numerous ads, including a remake of the famous Volkswagen \"The Man\" commercial. However, none of them were approved by the Volkswagen ad men because of the ads featuring explosions, gore, and speed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Changes (advertisement)|Changes]]\n*[[Lemon (automobile)]]\n*[[Think Small]]\n*[[VDub]]\n\n==References and sources==\n; References\n{{reflist}}\n\n; Sources\n*{{cite book\n|last = McLeod\n|first = Kate\n|title = Beetlemania: The Story of the Car That Captured the Hearts of Millions\n|publisher = Smithmark Publishers\n|year = 1999\n|location = New York\n|isbn = 0-7651-1018-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last = Reichert\n|first = Nikolaus\n|author2 = Hans Joachim Klersy\n|title = VW Beetle: An Illustrated History\n|publisher = J.
