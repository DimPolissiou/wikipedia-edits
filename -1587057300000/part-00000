''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' had arrived in Brest on 22 Mar 1941 after the success of [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]] in the Atlantic. More raids were planned and the ships for refitted at Brest. The ships were a substantial threat to Allied trans-Atlantic convoys and [[RAF Bomber Command]] attacked the ships from 30 Mar 1941. ''Gneisenau'' was hit on 6 April 1941 and on ''Scharnhorst'' on 24 July 1941, after dispersal to [[La Pallice]]. In late 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' (OKM German Navy high-command), to plan an operation to return the ships to German bases against a British invasion of [[Norway]]. The short route up the [[English Channel]] was preferred to a detour around the British Isles for surprise and air cover by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and on 12 January 1942, Hitler gave orders for the operation.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=111}}\n\nThe British exploited decrypts of German radio messages coded with the [[Enigma machine]], air reconnaissance by the RAF [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU) and agents in France to watch the ships and report the damage caused by the bombing. Operation Fuller, a joint Royal Navy-RAF contingency plan, was devised to counter a sortie by the German ships against Atlantic convoys, a return to German ports by circumnavigating the British Isles or a dash up the English Channel. The [[Royal Navy]] had to keep ships at [[Scapa Flow]] in Scotland, in case of a sortie by the German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] from Norway. The RAF had sent squadrons from Bomber and Coastal commands overseas and kept torpedo-bombers in Scotland ready for ''Tirpitz'', which limited the number of aircraft against a dash up the Channel, as did the winter weather which reduced visibility and blocked airfields with snow.\n\nOn 11 February 1942, the ships left Brest at {{nowrap|9:14 p.m.}} and escaped detection for more than twelve hours, approaching the [[Strait of Dover]] without discovery. The ''Luftwaffe'' [[Operation Donnerkeil|''Unternehmen Donnerkeil'']] (Operation Thunderbolt) provided air cover and as the ships neared Dover, the British belatedly began operations; the RAF, the [[Fleet Air Arm]], Navy and coastal artillery operations were costly failures but ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' hit mines in the [[North Sea]] and were damaged (''Scharnhorst'' was out of action for a year). By 13 February, the ships had reached German ports, [[Winston Churchill]] had ordered an inquiry into the debacle and ''[[The Times]]'' denounced the British fiasco. The ''Kriegsmarine'' judged the operation a tactical success and a strategic failure; the threat to Atlantic convoys had been sacrificed for a hypothetical threat to Norway. On 23 February ''Prinz Eugen'' was torpedoed off Norway, repaired and spent the rest of the war in the Baltic. ''Gneisenau'' went into a dry dock and was bombed on the night of {{nowrap|26/27 February,}} never to sail again; ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk at the [[Battle of the North Cape]] on 26 December 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Port of Brest, 1940\u20131941===\n\n{{Location map+ |France |width=200 |float=right |caption={{centre|La Pallice and French Channel ports}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.39 |long=-4.49 |label=[[Brest, France|Brest]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=46.158333 |long=-1.227778 |label=[[La Pallice]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.639 |long=-1.625 |label=[[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.5186 |long=1.595 |label=[[Le Touquet]] |label_size=80 |position=left |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.948056 |long=1.856389 |label=[[Calais]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n}}\nGerman commerce raiding against British north Atlantic convoys was made easier by the capture of Norway and France in 1940. An abortive sortie by the cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Admiral Hipper'']] ended at Brest, at the west end of the Brittany peninsula, on 27 December 1940. After five weeks of bombing to no effect, the ship put to sea on 1 February 1941, sank numerous ships and returned on 14 February, before sailing to Germany using the roundabout route via the [[Denmark Strait]] the next day, reaching [[Kiel]] on 28 March.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=372\u2013373}} The commerce raids in the north [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] during the winter of 1940\u20131941 by ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, the [[heavy cruiser]]s [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] and ''Admiral Hipper'' sank {{convert|115622|LT|t|abbr=on}} of British shipping, a higher rate than German surface ships achieved for the rest of the war. The British reformed [[No. 19 Group RAF|19 Group]] for [[Coastal Command]] in January 1941, which kept watch on the German ships at Brest; ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' arrived at the port of Brest on 22 March 1941.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=223\u2013224}}\n\n===British air offensive, 1941===\n\nFrom 10 January to mid-April 1941, Bomber Command aimed {{convert|829|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs at the ships in Brest harbour. Winston Churchill issued the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] directive on 9 March, directing the priority of the British war effort temporarily to counter the German campaign against Atlantic convoys.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=167, 234}} 1 PRU of the RAF discovered ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' in port on 28 March and Bomber Command flew about {{nowrap|1,161 sorties}} against the ships in Brest, through poor weather for the next two months. ''Gneisenau'' needed an overhaul of her engine room and entered dry dock on 4 April. When the water was pumped out, an unexploded bomb was found between the stocks under the ship.

''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' had arrived in Brest on 22 Mar 1941 after the success of [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]] in the Atlantic. More raids were planned and the ships for refitted at Brest. The ships were a substantial threat to Allied trans-Atlantic convoys and [[RAF Bomber Command]] attacked the ships from 30 Mar 1941. ''Gneisenau'' was hit on 6 April 1941 and on ''Scharnhorst'' on 24 July 1941, after dispersal to [[La Pallice]]. In late 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' (OKM German Navy high-command), to plan an operation to return the ships to German bases against a British invasion of [[Norway]]. The short route up the [[English Channel]] was preferred to a detour around the British Isles for surprise and air cover by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and on 12 January 1942, Hitler gave orders for the operation.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=111}}\n\nThe British exploited decrypts of German radio messages coded with the [[Enigma machine]], air reconnaissance by the RAF [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU) and agents in France to watch the ships and report the damage caused by the bombing. Operation Fuller, a joint Royal Navy-RAF contingency plan, was devised to counter a sortie by the German ships against Atlantic convoys, a return to German ports by circumnavigating the British Isles or a dash up the English Channel. The [[Royal Navy]] had to keep ships at [[Scapa Flow]] in Scotland, in case of a sortie by the German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] from Norway. The RAF had sent squadrons from Bomber and Coastal commands overseas and kept torpedo-bombers in Scotland ready for ''Tirpitz'', which limited the number of aircraft against a dash up the Channel, as did the winter weather which reduced visibility and blocked airfields with snow.\n\nOn 11 February 1942, the ships left Brest at {{nowrap|9:14 p.m.}} and escaped detection for more than twelve hours, approaching the [[Strait of Dover]] without discovery. The ''Luftwaffe'' [[Operation Donnerkeil|''Unternehmen Donnerkeil'']] (Operation Thunderbolt) provided air cover and as the ships neared Dover, the British belatedly began operations; the RAF, the [[Fleet Air Arm]], Navy and coastal artillery operations were costly failures but ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' hit mines in the [[North Sea]] and were damaged (''Scharnhorst'' was out of action for a year). By 13 February, the ships had reached German ports, [[Winston Churchill]] had ordered an inquiry into the debacle and ''[[The Times]]'' denounced the British fiasco. The ''Kriegsmarine'' judged the operation a tactical success and a strategic failure; the threat to Atlantic convoys had been sacrificed for a hypothetical threat to Norway. On 23 February ''Prinz Eugen'' was torpedoed off Norway, repaired and spent the rest of the war in the Baltic. ''Gneisenau'' went into a dry dock and was bombed on the night of {{nowrap|26/27 February,}} never to sail again; ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk at the [[Battle of the North Cape]] on 26 December 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Port of Brest, 1940\u20131941===\n\n{{Location map+ |France |width=200 |float=right |caption={{centre|La Pallice and French Channel ports}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.39 |long=-4.49 |label=[[Brest, France|Brest]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=46.158333 |long=-1.227778 |label=[[La Pallice]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.639 |long=-1.625 |label=[[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.5186 |long=1.595 |label=[[Le Touquet]] |label_size=80 |position=left |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.948056 |long=1.856389 |label=[[Calais]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n}}\nGerman commerce raiding against British north Atlantic convoys was made easier by the capture of Norway and France in 1940. An abortive sortie by the cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Admiral Hipper'']] ended at Brest, at the west end of the Brittany peninsula, on 27 December 1940. After five weeks of bombing to no effect, the ship put to sea on 1 February 1941, sank numerous ships and returned on 14 February, before sailing to Germany using the roundabout route via the [[Denmark Strait]] the next day, reaching [[Kiel]] on 28 March.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=372\u2013373}} The commerce raids in the north [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] during the winter of 1940\u20131941 by ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, the [[heavy cruiser]]s [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] and ''Admiral Hipper'' sank {{convert|115622|LT|t|abbr=on}} of British shipping, a higher rate than German surface ships achieved for the rest of the war. The British reformed [[No. 19 Group RAF|19 Group]] for [[Coastal Command]] in January 1941, which kept watch on the German ships at Brest; ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' arrived at the port of Brest on 22 March 1941.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=223\u2013224}}\n\n===British air offensive, 1941===\n\nFrom 10 January to mid-April 1941, Bomber Command aimed {{convert|829|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs at the ships in Brest harbour. Winston Churchill issued the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] directive on 9 March, directing the priority of the British war effort temporarily to counter the German campaign against Atlantic convoys.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=167, 234}} 1 PRU of the RAF discovered ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' in port on 28 March and Bomber Command flew about {{nowrap|1,161 sorties}} against the ships in Brest, through poor weather for the next two months. ''Gneisenau'' needed an overhaul of her engine room and entered dry dock on 4 April. When the water was pumped out, an unexploded bomb was found between the stocks under the ship. The ship had to be carefully refloated and removed so that the bomb could be defused. ''Gneisenau'' was moored in an exposed position in the roadstead, where it was photographed by a 1 PRU Spitfire on 5 April. [[Bristol Beaufort]] torpedo bombers attacked at dawn next day; one aircraft found the harbour through the haze and torpedoed ''Gneisenau'' on the starboard side, seriously damaging the reserve command centre. The ship was dry-docked again and on the night of {{nowrap|10/11 April,}} Bomber Command achieved four hits and two near-misses. One of the hits did not explode but the others jammed 'B' turret, locally distorted the armoured deck, made about a third of the crew quarters uninhabitable by fire and blast damage, destroyed the kitchens and bakery and affected some gunnery control systems.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=51}} ''Scharnhorst'' was not damaged but the bomb hits on the docks delayed its refit, which included a substantial overhaul of its machinery; the boiler superheater tubes had a manufacturing defect that had plagued the ship throughout [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]].{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=159}} The work had been expected to take ten weeks but along with mines dropped in the vicinity, the ships were not available to support [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Unternehmen Rhein\u00fcbung'']] (Operation Rhine Exercise) the breakout of [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and the ''Hipper''-class cruiser [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen'']] into the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' was sunk but ''Prinz Eugen'' had returned separately and arrived at Brest on 1 June. The loss of ''Bismarck'' severely limited the freedom of action of the German surface fleet after Hitler ordered that capital ships must operate with much greater caution.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=246}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=54\u201357}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=223\u2013225, 233, 236\u2013237}}\n\n[[File:Brest, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1939-1941 C2228.jpg|thumb|{{centre|[[No. 35 Squadron RAF|35 Squadron]] Halifax bombers over Brest, 1941 (C2228)}}|alt=Vertical aerial photograph taken during a daylight attack on German warships docked at Brest, France.

The sailing on 21 July of ''Scharnhorst'' to La Pallice, the deep-water port of [[La Rochelle]] down the French Atlantic coast, forestalled an attempt by Bomber Command to attack the ships in Brest by surprise. ''Scharnhorst'' was attacked by six Stirling bombers on the evening of 23 July, about six German fighters intervened and one bomber was shot down. The attack on Brest took place in daylight on 24 July, with a loss of {{nowrap|13 bombers;}} La Pallice was bombed again by fifteen [[Handley Page Halifax]]es. One bomber failed to find La Pallice and the rest were met by {{nowrap|12\u201318 Bf 109s}} and anti-aircraft fire ([[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]]) and all {{nowrap|14 Halifaxes}} were hit, and affecting their bomb-aiming. Five bombers were shot down, five were seriously damaged and ''Scharnhorst'' was hit five times.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=240\u2013241}}{{efn|The plan had been to make a surprise attack on the ships at Brest in daylight, escorted by five long-range Spitfire squadrons, which by then had been fitted with external fuel tanks. Only {{nowrap|30 single-engined}} and nine twin-engined German day fighters were thought to be based near Brest, with another {{nowrap|60 at}} Cherbourg and the Channel Islands. Bomber Command planners thought that {{nowrap|140\u2013150 bombers}} would be needed but the bomber pilots were inexperienced in formation flying and the number of long-range Spitfires was insufficient to escort a loose formation. Unescorted [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Fortress Is]] were to attack first at height, followed {{nowrap|15 minutes}} later by {{nowrap|18 Hampden}} bombers with three Spitfire squadron escorts, to attract German fighters and leave them short of fuel and ammunition. The main force of {{nowrap|120 Wellingtons}} and heavy bombers were to attack for {{nowrap|45 minutes,}} with the last two Spitfire squadrons in the vicinity for any German fighters that managed to make second sorties. The fighters near Cherbourg were to be diverted by Blenheim bombers covered by normal Spitfires of 11 Group. The Hampden crews trained for a month but the plan was upset when ''Scharnhorst'' was found to have sailed to La Pallice, beyond the reach of the long-range Spitfires. The heavy bombers were taken out of the Brest attack and Manchester bombers were withdrawn due to mechanical defects, reducing the main force to {{nowrap|78 bombers.}} The rest of the bombers attacked Brest on 24 July; the Fortress crews saw a few German fighters and the Hampdens reported about {{nowrap|24 more}} but the main force was too small to swamp the German ground defences and {{nowrap|11 bombers}} were shot down by fighters and flak; two more bombers crashed on their return flights.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=240\u2013241}}}} While returning to Brest containing {{convert|3000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of seawater, a Beaufort attacked and was shot down before the torpedo was dropped.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=167, 240\u2013241}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=361}}\n\nFrom 28 March to the end of July, {{convert|1962|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped in {{nowrap|1,875 sorties,}} {{nowrap|1,723 by}} Bomber Command, which also sent {{nowrap|205 minelaying}} sorties, with another {{nowrap|159 from}} Coastal Command, laying {{nowrap|275 mines}} off Brest; the British lost {{nowrap|34 aircraft,}} three being minelayers. For the next two months, Bomber Command made frequent small attacks, then {{nowrap|56 bombers}} attacked on the night of {{nowrap|3/4 September,}} followed by {{nowrap|120 bombers}} on the night of {{nowrap|13/14 September.}} Frequent small attacks were resumed and about {{nowrap|1,000 sorties}} were made from July to December.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=487, 491}} At the start of the month, the Brest Group was made the Bomber Command priority again and from 11 December, bombing and minelaying took place nightly. When ''Prinz Eugen'' was found out of dry dock on 16 December, a plan for a big night raid, followed up by a day raid was implemented, with a {{nowrap|101-bomber}} raid on the night of {{nowrap|17/18 December}} and a daylight raid by {{nowrap|41 heavy}} bombers on the afternoon of 18 December, escorted by ten fighter squadrons. ''Gneisenau'' was lightly damaged and dock gates were smashed, stranding ''Scharnhorst'' for a month, for a loss six bombers. Big attacks continued all month and another day raid by Halifaxes was made on 30 December. From 1 August to 31 December, {{convert|1175|LT|t|abbr=on}} of high explosive and {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} of incendiaries were dropped, eleven heavy bombers were shot down and considerable damage inflicted on the docks and the town but none of the ships were hit again. ''Gneisenau'' was damaged on the evening of 6 January and between 10 December and 20 January 1942, 37 percent of Bomber Command sorties were flown against the ships at Brest.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|p=491}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=349, 361\u2013363}}{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|p=320}}{{efn|A Directorate of Bomber Operations paper of 5 April 1941 concluded that achieving one hit on each ship took from {{nowrap|2,200 to 5,000 bombs}} dropped.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|1961|p=458}}}}\n\n===Ultra===\n\n{{See also|Enigma machine|Ultra}}\n\n[[File:Bristol Beauforts 217 Squadron in flight.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Bristol Beaufort torpedo-bombers of 217 Squadron, RAF Coastal Command.}}]]\nUltra was the code name used by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military intelligence]], for [[signals intelligence]] obtained by breaking German [[radio]] and [[teleprinter]] communications encrypted by Enigma, a German [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical]] [[rotor machine|rotor cipher machine]]. The decryption was carried out at the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]] and the information was passed on to operational commands.{{sfn|Hinsley|1979|p=346}} From May 1941, Bletchley could read the Enigma ''Home Waters'' setting used by surface ships, with few failures or interruptions, which combined with the PRU and reports from agents, kept watch on the ships at Brest.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=124}} By April 1941, the British knew that the three ships had been hit but not the extent of the damage and from 16 to 23 December, Enigma decrypts showed that the gunners of the ships were on the Baltic, conducting gunnery training; next day, the Admiralty warned that an attempt to break out was likely.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=134}} On 25 January 1942, the ships were photographed in the harbour and two short periods in dry dock by two ships were seen. From the end of January to early February, torpedo boats, minesweepers and destroyers joined the big ships; together with news that the battleship ''Tirpitz'' in Norway had moved to the south, this led the Admiralty to issue an appreciation on 2 February, that the three ships were going to attempt to sail up the channel and sent the signal ''Executive Fuller''.{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=363}} Next day Enigma and RAF photographic reconnaissance (PR) found that the number of German ship reinforcements from Brest to the [[Hook of Holland]] had risen to seven destroyers, ten torpedo-boats, more than {{nowrap|30 minesweepers,}} {{nowrap|25 [[E-boat]]s}} and many smaller craft.{{Sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=132}}\n\n===Norway Hypothesis===\n\n[[File:Norwegian Sea map.png|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the Denmark Strait}}]]\nDuring 1941, Hitler decided that the Brest Group should return to home waters in a \"surprise break through the Channel\", as part of a plan to thwart a British invasion of Norway. ''OKM'' preferred the Denmark Strait passage to Germany and ''[[Grand Admiral|Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' (Grand Admiral) [[Erich Raeder]] called a journey along the English Channel impossible.{{sfn|Martienssen|1949|pp=121\u2013122}} Hitler said that the break-out should be planned with no training period, since British intelligence was bound to find out and have the ships bombed. Hitler ordered that a period of bad weather should be chosen, when the bulk of the RAF would be grounded. ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral) [[Kurt Fricke]] (Chief of Staff of the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]] SKL'', Maritime Warfare Command) opposed Hitler but was allowed only a short time to review the policy. On 12 January 1942, Raeder again opposed the channel route but planned for it, provided that Hitler took the final decision.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=358\u2013360}}\n\nHitler noted that the ships at Brest had diverted British bombing from Germany but that the advantage would end as soon as the ships were sufficiently damaged. Vice Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] outlined a plan for a standing start at night to gain surprise and to pass the Strait of Dover during the day, to benefit from fighter cover at the danger point. The ''Luftwaffe'' refused to guarantee that the {{nowrap|250 fighters}} available could succeed in protecting the ships but Hitler accepted the plan.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=358\u2013360}} Hitler ordered that the battleship ''Tirpitz'', already in Norway, was to be moved south to [[Trondheim]]. At a conference on 22 January, Hitler announced that all ships and U-boats should assemble for the defence of Norway and on 25 January, ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the (''Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote'', ''BdU'', Commander of Submarines) was ordered to withdraw eight submarines to patrol off [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Scotland]]; despite protests from D\u00f6nitz, another twelve U-boats were reserved for Norway, along with the surface ships being concentrated in Norwegian waters.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=149, 100, 149\u2013150}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Operation Cerberus===\n\n{{Location map+ |Norway |width=150 |float=right |caption={{centre|Norway}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |Norway |lat=63.429722 |long=10.393333 |label=[[Trondheim]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n}}\nHitler preferred the Channel route and responsibility was delegated to ''Marine-Gruppenkommando West'' (Naval Command West, Admiral [[Alfred Saalw\u00e4chter]]) for planning and operational directions; Ciliax, was commander of the Brest Group (flagship, ''Scharnhorst'').{{sfn| Martienssen|1949|pp=121\u2013122}} Care was taken to choose the best route, to avoid British minefields and to steam at high speed. Minesweepers cleared channels through the British mines and marked with buoys (from 3\u20139 February, Bomber Command laid 98 mines in the channels). U-boats were sent for meteorological observations and several destroyers steamed westward down the Channel to Brest to strengthen the escort screen.{{sfn|Martienssen|1949|pp=122\u2013123}} To have the longest period of darkness possible, the departure was to be four days before the [[new moon]] and at {{nowrap|7:30 p.m.,}} to benefit from a [[spring tide]] flowing up-Channel, which would add speed and possibly lift the ships over mines.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=150}}\n\nAir cover was to be provided by the ''Luftwaffe'' and six destroyers would escort the Brest Group on the first leg, to be joined by ten E-Boats at dawn and a mixture of E-boats, R-boats and small craft would join at [[Cap Gris Nez]]. During January, the ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe'' rehearsed the operation but the ships had lost seaworthiness and many technicians and experts had been transferred from Brest to more pressing duties. By 9 February, the ships had completed their trials in Brest roads and the sortie was set for 11 February.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=150}} Morale of the crews was high, no sabotage had occurred at Brest and the crews went ashore freely. Among locals there was no doubt that the ships were preparing to depart and as a deception, tropical helmets were brought on board, French dock workers loaded oil barrels marked \"For Use in the Tropics\" and false rumours were spread around town.{{sfn|Ruge|1957|p=264}}\n\n====''Unternehmen Donnerkeil''====\n\n{{see also|Operation Donnerkeil}}\n\nHans Jeschonnek the ''Luftwaffe'' chief of staff refused to guarantee the success of Cerberus or to reinforce the fighter forces in the west.

The ''Funkhorchdienst'' (signals intelligence service, General [[Wolfgang Martini]]) attempted to jam British radio-telephone frequencies by using a technique to increase atmospheric interference to reduce the performance of British coastal radars. [[Dornier Do 217]]s of ''[[Kampfgeschwader 2]]'' (Bomber Wing 2) were to fly electronic deception sorties over the western Channel to divert British aircraft. ''[[9th Air Corps (Germany)|Fliegerkorps IX]]'' (''[[General der Flieger]]'' [''Luftwaffe'' General] [[Joachim Coeler]]) prepared to bomb RAF bases in south-west England and to attack and distract British naval forces attempting to intercept the Brest Group.

Eight rehearsals, involving around {{nowrap|450 sorties,}} were made from 22 January \u2013 10 February. The ''[[Jagdgeschwader]]'' (day fighter wings) and the night fighters of ''[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]]'' (Night Fighter Group 1), were swiftly to prepare aircraft for the next sortie by rearming and refuelling in thirty minutes or fewer.{{sfn|Hooton|1994|pp=114\u2013115}} Galland decided that the aircraft should fly high and low cover, the low groups flying under British coastal radar. A standing patrol of least {{nowrap|16 fighters}} was to be maintained, in two groups of eight aircraft for their patrol altitudes, with each formation in two ''Schw\u00e4rme'' of four aircraft. One ''Schwarm'' was to fly out to sea and one towards land in a zigzag and all ''Schw\u00e4rme'' were to fly back and forth along the line of ships in wide figures of eight, in radio silence. Every sortie was timed to allow the fighters {{nowrap|30 minutes}} over the ships, just enough time for relieved units to refuel and rearm and return.

Next day the Nore Command was ordered to keep six destroyers on call in the Thames and be ready to send six torpedo boats to reinforce those at Dover. The [[Abdiel-class minelayer]]s {{HMS|Manxman|M70|6}} and {{HMS|Welshman|M84|6}} were detached to Plymouth Command to mine the Brest approaches and to Dover to mine the eastern exit of the Channel respectively.

Hitler had exchanged the threat to British Atlantic convoys for a defensive deployment near Norway against a threat that never materialised. Roskill wrote that the British had misjudged the time of day when the German ships would sail but this mistake was less influential than the circumstantial failures of Coastal Command reconnaissance to detect the ships which had been at sea for {{nowrap|12 hours,}} four of them after dawn had broken, before the alarm was raised. Churchill ordered a Board of Enquiry (Sir [[Alfred Townsend Bucknill]]), which criticised Coastal Command for failing to ensure that a dawn reconnaissance was flown to compensate for the problems of the night patrols off Brest and Ushant to the Isle de Br\u00e9hat. The inquiry also held that there should have been more suspicion of the German radar jamming on the morning of 12 February and that involving Bomber Command in an operation for which it was untrained was a mistake.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nThe board found that the delay in detecting the German ships led to the British attacks being made piecemeal, against formidable German defensive arrangements and that the few aircraft and ships that found the group were \"cut to pieces\".{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=160}} In 2012, Ken Ford wrote that the inquiry was, perforce, a whitewash, blaming instrument failures rather than incompetence but the report was still kept secret until 1946.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=75}} In 1991, John Buckley wrote that the ASV Hudsons had been forbidden to use flares off Brest, because of the presence of ''Sealion'' and that one of the technical faults to an ASV could have been repaired, had the operator carried out a fuze check properly. Joubert was criticised for complacency, in not sending replacement sorties, despite his earlier warning that the Brest Group was about to sail, because of the assumption in Operation Fuller since 6 April 1941, that a day sailing was certain,\n\n{{quote|...a classic example of befuddled tactical thinking, poor co-operation and almost non-existent co-ordination.|Robertson{{sfn|Buckley|1991|p=359}}}}\n\nThe dash exposed many failings in RAF planning, that only three torpedo-bomber squadrons with {{nowrap|31 Beauforts}} were in Britain, that training had been limited by the lack of torpedoes and the example of Japanese tactics had been ignored. The effectiveness of Bomber Command against moving ships was shown to be negligible and the failure to ensure unity of command before Operation Fuller began, led to piecemeal attacks using unsuitable tactics.{{sfn|Buckley|1991|pp=356\u2013365}}\n\n[[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]] the Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry, wrote in 1998 that on 11 February, Lieutenant-Colonel B. E. Wallace of the army Radar Interception Unit, had called for his assistance. For several days, army radar stations on the south coast had been jammed and Wallace had reported this internally but a gradual increase in jamming had misled most operators to its intensity.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=233\u2013235}} Martini, the ''[[General der Luftnachrichtentruppe]]'' (General of Air Force Communications Troops) had unobtrusively made the British radar cover \"almost useless\". Jones wrote of the ASV reconnaissance,\n\n{{quote|Nay, it were better, to meet some Dangers halfe way, though they come nothing neare, than to keepe too long a watch, upon their Approaches: For if a Man watch too long, it is odds that he will fall asleepe.|Francis Bacon, ''Of Delayes''{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=235}}}}\n\nand included an anecdote that the chain of command broke down under the shock of the Brest Group sailing so far up the Channel undiscovered. Air Marshals were said to have sat on each other's desks, thinking of pilots they could telephone to find the ships; even after the Brest Group had been found, contact was lost several times. In 1955, Jones met Captain Giessler, the Navigating Officer on ''Scharnhorst'', who said that the worst time in the operation was the thirty minutes that ''Scharnhorst'' was stationary after hitting a mine just beyond Dover; in the low cloud none of the British aircraft found them.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=235}}{{efn|In 2013, Goodchild wrote that although Operation Fuller was a scientific and technological failure, Jones exaggerated for effect in his memoir.
