The [[Cumberland Plain]] lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew. It was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated. [[Beaches in Sydney|Seventy beaches]] can be found along its coastline with Bondi Beach being one of the most famous.\n\nThe [[Nepean River]] wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching [[Broken Bay]]. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The [[Parramatta River]] is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson.

The sandstone has [[shale]] lenses and fossil riverbeds.<ref name=\"Sydney Basin\"/>\n\nThe [[Sydney Basin]] bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. Deep river valleys known as [[ria]]s were carved during the [[Triassic]] period in the [[Hawkesbury sandstone]] of the coastal region where Sydney now lies.

The Upper North Shore usually refers to the suburbs between {{NSWcity|Chatswood}} and {{NSWcity|Hornsby}}. It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous and variable. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.

[[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]], a historic suburb named after the French navigator [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]] (1741\u201388), is notable for its old military outpost at [[Bare Island (New South Wales)|Bare Island]] and the [[Botany Bay National Park]].\n\nThe suburb of [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] in [[southern Sydney]] is close to [[Royal National Park]], Australia's oldest national park.

This area includes suburbs in the [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of [[Hornsby Shire]], [[City of Ryde]], the [[Municipality of Hunter's Hill]] and parts of the [[City of Parramatta]].\n\nThe [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], an informal geographic term referring to the northern metropolitan area of Sydney, consists of {{NSWcity|Artarmon}}, {{NSWcity|Chatswood}}, {{NSWcity|Roseville}}, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}, [[Killara]], {{NSWcity|Gordon}}, {{NSWcity|Pymble}}, {{NSWcity|Hornsby}} and many others.\n\nThe Lower North Shore usually refers to the suburbs adjacent to the harbour such as {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}, {{NSWcity|Waverton}}, [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], {{NSWcity|Cremorne}}, [[Cremorne Point]], {{NSWcity|Lavender Bay}}, [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]], {{NSWcity|Cammeray}}, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]], and North Sydney. {{NSWcity|Hunters Hill}} and {{NSWcity|Gladesville}} are often also considered as being part of the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Liveable Sydney: The lower north shore's suburbs ranked by liveability|url=https://www.domain.com.au/news/liveable-sydney-lower-north-shore-ranked|date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The Lower North Shore's eastern boundary is [[Middle Harbour]], or at the [[Roseville Bridge]] at {{NSWcity|Castle Cove}} and {{NSWcity|Roseville Chase}}. The Upper North Shore usually refers to the suburbs between {{NSWcity|Chatswood}} and {{NSWcity|Hornsby}}. It is made up of suburbs located within [[Ku-ring-gai Council|Ku-ring-gai]] and [[Hornsby Shire]] councils.\n\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large corporations holding office in the region.\n\nThe Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the {{cvt|2|km}} wide entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>[http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php National Regional Profile: Northern Beaches Sydney]</ref>\n\n===Hills district===\nThe [[Hills District|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous and variable. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau.\n\nSeveral of its suburbs also have \"Hill\" or \"Hills\" in their names, such as [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]], [[Pendle Hill, New South Wales|Pendle Hill]], [[Beaumont Hills, New South Wales|Beaumont Hills]], and [[Winston Hills, New South Wales|Winston Hills]], among others.

Born in [[Koyukuk, Alaska]], Notti arguably played the most pivotal role in developing the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in United States history. ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska and could, perhaps, be considered an ending of more than a century of endeavor by the Native people of the state to secure their land, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska. Notti was the first President of the Alaska Federation of Natives and Doyon\u2019s third President, a regional corporation who owns 12.5 million acres. <ref>https://www.doyon.com/shareholder-spotlight-emil-notti/</ref> He is a U.S. Navy veteran and worked for Autonetics, a division of North American Aviation, on the Minuteman Ballistic Missile during The Cold War. Later, he served under several Alaska Governors as Deputy Commissioner of Health and Social Services, Commissioner of Community and Regional Affairs and Commissioner of Commerce, Community and Economic Development. These Governors included William Egan, the first governor of the State of Alaska, Bill Sheffield, and Sarah Palin, the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2008 presidential election. Notti served on numerous boards, including the National Bank of Alaska (acquired by Wells Fargo), the Alaska Railroad, a two time Board of Trustee for APFC (the United State's largest Sovereign Wealth Fund with $75 billion under management), and Cook Inlet Regional, Inc. Notti earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical and electrical engineering from Northrop University. He holds honorary doctorate degrees from both Alaska Pacific University and the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\n==AFN and ANCSA==\nOn an October morning in 1966, Emil called for a Statewide meeting inviting numerous leaders around Alaska to gather and create the first meeting of a committee. The historic meeting was held October 18, 1966 - on the 99th anniversary of the transfer of Alaska from Russia. Notti presided over the three-day conference as it discussed matters of land recommendations, claims committees, and political challenges the act would have getting through Congress. Many respected politicians and businessmen attended the meeting and delegates were astonished at the attention which they received from well-known political figures of the state. One Native leader in attendance at the convention observed that \"if any delegate was seen paying for his own meal, it was probably because he chose to dine alone!\" The growing presence and political importance of Natives were evidenced when association leaders were elected to the legislature. Members of the association gathered and were able to gain seven of the sixty seats in the legislature. When the group met a second time early in 1967, it emerged with a new name, The Alaska Federation of Natives, and a new full-time President, Emil Notti. AFN would change the human rights and economic stability of the Alaska Native population forever.\n\nBefore ANCSA, the Native population had gone through numerous hardships over the last century from European expansion. In the mid-1700s Alaska's population (according to [[James Mooney]]) was home to an estimated 74,000 Eskimos, Indians, and Aleuts. As of 2018, the Native population in Alaska is around 110,972 showing the cruelties and killings of thousands over generations by the Russian fur traders during the [[Russian-American Company]] period. From 1750 to 2018 the annual growth rate of the local Alaska Native population has been 0.15%. In comparison, since 1790 the United States population as a whole has grown at a 1.96% annual growth rate. Alaska's closest comparable state by population is North Dakota at a 2017 estimate of 757,000 residents. The population of North Dakota has grown 3.96% since the earliest data of North Dakota demographics. Alaskan Natives' low growth rate is just barely lower than Poland's 1931-2018 rate of 0.20% which suffered over six million deaths in [[World War II]].\n\nAfter the [[Alaska Purchase|purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867]], Alaska was still not classified a State and was considered a territory. Native Alaskans still did not have the rights of U.S. citizens. \"Thus, without further ceremony,\" wrote historian Bancroft, \"this vast area of land, belonging by right to neither, was transferred from one European race to the offshoot of another.\" Negotiations regarding the purchase of the land were conducted with such speed that the treaty itself was hastily drawn and failed to define clearly the status of Natives, their rights, or matters of land ownership. Only one paragraph (part of Article III) was devoted to the inhabitants of Russia-America. It was not until 1959 that Alaska would officially become a State of the United States. \n\nAt hearings held in Fairbanks and Anchorage the 17th and 18th of October 1969 prior to the passage of ANCSA, Notti commented pushing that the money in the bill was not enough \"The $500 million provision of our bill may seem like a lot of money, but after looking at the conditions in our villages, $500 million will only give our Native people a chance to operate on a standard of living of what we consider basic minimums, I think, for the rest of the United States.\" <ref>http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/testimony/ancsa_hearings/e_notti_s.html</ref>In its final bill, ANCSA would give the Native people of Alaska over $900 million. After many congressional meetings, he had no organization, no political experience, no funding; there was no precedent for what had to be done. He accomplished the task of the land claims in five years. ANCSA, the act, composed of 44 million acres (180,000 km2) and $962.5 million patented and titles transferred to twelve Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village corporations. The surface rights to the patented land were granted to the village corporations and the subsurface right to the land was granted to the regional corporation, creating a split estate pursuant to section 14(f). Notti also cast the tie-breaking vote to enter Sealaska and Tlingit and Haida into the Alaska Federation of Natives. His tie-breaker vote brought $7.2 million and 290,000 acres of land to Native Corporations in Southeast Alaska.<ref>https://www.kinyradio.com/news/news-of-the-north/sealaska-speech/</ref> In 2017, 9 out of the 10 largest Alaska-owned and -operated corporations by revenue were Native corporations, given life by the creation of ANCSA. The twelve regional Native corporations and several village corporations today employ around 58,000 people creating thousands of jobs for Native and non-Native Alaskans.  \n\nIn his foreword to the book ''Alaska Native Land Claims'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Alaska-native-claims-Robert-Arnold/dp/B0006CVEIE|title=Alaska native land claims|date=1976|author=Robert D Arnold|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> published with support from the Ford Foundation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=ford+foundation&oq=ford+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l2j69i57j69i60l2.1417j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8|title=ford foundation - Google Search|website=Google.com|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> Notti delivers a powerfully compelling narrative about the passage of ANCSA and its implications as an awakening to the Canadian and Hawaiian Native people. An excerpt from the Foreword:\n\n<blockquote>No Alaskan--Native or non-Native--is unaffected by the settlement. To some it has meant money and title to lands and the growing assurance that comes from waging a successful fight and becoming a little more a master of one's own fate; to others it means they are no longer so free to move across the face of Alaska as millions of acres become private property. Nov. 1975</blockquote>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the passage of ANCSA, Notti continued his career with AFN, eventually becoming the CEO of Doyon Limited, Commissioner of Commerce & Economic Development, and Commissioner of Community & Regional Affairs for the State of Alaska. \n\nToday, Notti is considered one of the most highly respected leaders of the Native Alaskan people and many State and local public officials during elections seek his endorsement to gain the Native population vote.
