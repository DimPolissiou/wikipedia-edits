Directed by [[Spike Lee]], it stars [[Derek Luke]], [[Michael Ealy]], [[Laz Alonso]], [[Omar Benson Miller]], [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] and [[Valentina Cervi]]. Set primarily [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|in Italy]] during [[German-occupied Europe]] in [[World War II]], the film tells the story of four [[Buffalo Soldier]]s of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]] who seek refuge in a small [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] village, where they form a bond with the residents. The story is presented as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], as one survivor, Hector Negron (Alonso), reflects upon his experiences in a [[frame story]] set in 1980s New York. Several real-life events that occurred during the war, such as the [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre]], are re-enacted, placing ''Miracle at St. Anna'' within the genre of [[historical fiction]].\n\nLee first learned of the novel in 2004 and approached McBride with the idea of a film adaptation. In Europe, the film's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini, who helped finance the $45 million production. A majority of the film was shot in Italy, on several locations affected by World War II. Other filming locations included New York, Louisiana and The Bahamas. Frequent Lee collaborator [[Terence Blanchard]] composed the [[film score|score]], and the visual effects were created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]].\n\n''Miracle at St. Anna'' premiered at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]] before it was released on September 26, 2008. It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies. During its theatrical run, ''Miracle at St. Anna'' was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing only $9.3 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1983, Hector Negron, an aged, African American [[World War II]] veteran, works as a post office clerk in [[New York City]]. After recognizing a customer, Negron shoots and kills the man with a German [[Luger pistol]]. Several hours later, rookie reporter Tim Boyle and Detective Tony Ricci are at the crime scene seeking information. At Negron's apartment, Boyle, Ricci and other officers discover a finely carved statue head, the Head of the ''Primavera'', a long missing segment from the [[Ponte Santa Trinita]]. Also found is a [[Purple Heart]] and a photograph revealing that Negron was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and [[Silver Star]].\n\nNegron, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], tells of his war experiences as a young [[corporal]] of the segregated [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]] in Italy, late 1944 during the [[Gothic line]] phase of the Italian campaign. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the [[Serchio]] River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded on the wrong side of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the ''Primavera'' that he found in [[Florence]], which he believes to carry magical powers. He and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One of the villagers, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a [[love triangle]] with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.\n\nAfter Negron gets his damaged backpack radio working, the soldiers contact headquarters and are told to capture an enemy soldier. A [[Italian resistance movement|local Italian Partisan]] group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema]] were [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre|killed by German forces]] following a betrayal by a partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent drive out of town, but are killed in the opening German offensive.\n\nThe remaining Americans and Partisans hold their ground, killing many Germans. Bishop and Negron hold off the Germans while Stamps tries to get the villagers to safety, but they are too heavily outnumbered. Sam, Stamps and Bishop are killed in the attack. While attempting to retreat, Negron is shot in the back, but is saved by his backpack radio. After Angelo gives him the Primavera's Head, Negron gives the boy his rosary and tells him to leave. Angelo is led away by the spirit of his brother Arturo, who had been killed during the massacre at St. Anna. Negron is spared by a German officer who hands him his own Luger pistol and tells Negron to defend himself. More Americans arrive and secure the village before evacuating Negron.\n\nIn 1984, Negron is the defendant in a court proceeding, facing a life sentence for his killing of Rodolfo. He is defended at his bail hearing by a powerful  attorney acting on behalf of an unknown wealthy man. Hector is brought to the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] and is reunited with the Head of the ''Primavera'', accompanied by its new owner who takes out a rosary and reveals himself as an adult Angelo. They both hold Hector's rosary and burst into tears of remembrance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]] as Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps:\n:One of four stranded [[Buffalo Soldier]]s from the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]].

Favino was the filmmakers' primary choice for the role.

After witnessing several atrocities, he basically snaps and becomes one of the most ruthless and most clever and most sought-after Partisans.

Directed by [[Spike Lee]], it stars [[Derek Luke]], [[Michael Ealy]], [[Laz Alonso]], [[Omar Benson Miller]], [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] and [[Valentina Cervi]]. Set primarily [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|in Italy]] during [[German-occupied Europe]] in [[World War II]], the film tells the story of four [[Buffalo Soldier]]s of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]] who seek refuge in a small [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] village, where they form a bond with the residents. The story is presented as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], as one survivor, Hector Negron (Alonso), reflects upon his experiences in a [[frame story]] set in 1980s New York. Several real-life events that occurred during the war, such as the [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre]], are re-enacted, placing ''Miracle at St. Anna'' within the genre of [[historical fiction]].\n\nLee first learned of the novel in 2004 and approached McBride with the idea of a film adaptation. In Europe, the film's development attracted the attention of Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini, who helped finance the $45 million production. A majority of the film was shot in Italy, on several locations affected by World War II. Other filming locations included New York, Louisiana and The Bahamas. Frequent Lee collaborator [[Terence Blanchard]] composed the [[film score|score]], and the visual effects were created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]].\n\n''Miracle at St. Anna'' premiered at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]] before it was released on September 26, 2008. It was met with mostly negative reviews from critics and drew controversy in Italy over historical inaccuracies. During its theatrical run, ''Miracle at St. Anna'' was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing only $9.3 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1983, Hector Negron, an aged, African American [[World War II]] veteran, works as a post office clerk in [[New York City]]. After recognizing a customer, Negron shoots and kills the man with a German [[Luger pistol]]. Several hours later, rookie reporter Tim Boyle and Detective Tony Ricci are at the crime scene seeking information. At Negron's apartment, Boyle, Ricci and other officers discover a finely carved statue head, the Head of the ''Primavera'', a long missing segment from the [[Ponte Santa Trinita]]. Also found is a [[Purple Heart]] and a photograph revealing that Negron was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and [[Silver Star]].\n\nNegron, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], tells of his war experiences as a young [[corporal]] of the segregated [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]] in Italy, late 1944 during the [[Gothic line]] phase of the Italian campaign. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the [[Serchio]] River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded on the wrong side of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the ''Primavera'' that he found in [[Florence]], which he believes to carry magical powers. He and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One of the villagers, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a [[love triangle]] with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.\n\nAfter Negron gets his damaged backpack radio working, the soldiers contact headquarters and are told to capture an enemy soldier. A [[Italian resistance movement|local Italian Partisan]] group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema]] were [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre|killed by German forces]] following a betrayal by a partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent drive out of town, but are killed in the opening German offensive.\n\nThe remaining Americans and Partisans hold their ground, killing many Germans. Bishop and Negron hold off the Germans while Stamps tries to get the villagers to safety, but they are too heavily outnumbered. Sam, Stamps and Bishop are killed in the attack. While attempting to retreat, Negron is shot in the back, but is saved by his backpack radio. After Angelo gives him the Primavera's Head, Negron gives the boy his rosary and tells him to leave. Angelo is led away by the spirit of his brother Arturo, who had been killed during the massacre at St. Anna. Negron is spared by a German officer who hands him his own Luger pistol and tells Negron to defend himself. More Americans arrive and secure the village before evacuating Negron.\n\nIn 1984, Negron is the defendant in a court proceeding, facing a life sentence for his killing of Rodolfo. He is defended at his bail hearing by a powerful  attorney acting on behalf of an unknown wealthy man. Hector is brought to the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] and is reunited with the Head of the ''Primavera'', accompanied by its new owner who takes out a rosary and reveals himself as an adult Angelo. They both hold Hector's rosary and burst into tears of remembrance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]] as Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps:\n:One of four stranded [[Buffalo Soldier]]s from the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]].
