Drury, who had served as a missionary in the [[Philippines]], found St. Paul's in almost all aspects&nbsp;\u2014 student body, faculty, and curriculum&nbsp;\u2014 severely lacking a serious commitment to academic pursuits and moral upstandingness. Accordingly, he presided over, among other things, the hiring of better teachers, the tightening of academic standards, and the dissolution of secret societies and their replacement with a student council. Drury also presided over the school throughout the 1920s and 1930s during what August Hecksher called its \"[[Caesar Augustus|Augustan]] era\".<ref name = Hecksher />\n\nThirty years later, the 1960s ushered in a turbulent period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an [[Acerbic wit|acerbic]] manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As a result of this manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and&nbsp;- grades (re-introduced in 2016) and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A\u2013F.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.sps.edu/exhibits/sesquicentennial/Exhibit6/49Formof1968.htm |title=SPS Sesquicentennial Exhibit |publisher= |accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=2018\u201319 Student Handbook|url=https://millville.sps.edu/allaccess/documents/deanofstudents/spshandbook.pdf?201709070232|journal=SPS Handbook|volume=|pages=84|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020204845/https://millville.sps.edu/allaccess/documents/deanofstudents/spshandbook.pdf?201709070232|archive-date=2018-10-20|via=}}</ref> By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had [[Secularization|secularized]] its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin [[coeducation]].

Wednesdays and Saturdays, however, are half-days, with athletic games or practices in the afternoons. The school has four grades, known at St. Paul's as \"forms\". For example, \"Third Form\" corresponds to ninth grade, up through \"Sixth Form\", which corresponds to twelfth grade.\n\nFor Paulies, as St. Paul's students are colloquially known, the four full days each week begin with Chapel. The mandatory [[interfaith]] half-hour meeting involves a reading, speech or music presentation, and community-wide announcements.\n\nSt. Paul's conducts its Humanities classes using the [[Harkness table|Harkness method]], which encourages discussion between students and the teacher, and between students.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Harkness Table: Schools |url=http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |accessdate=26 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510091829/http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |archivedate=10 May 2014 }}</ref> The average class size according to the school's website is 10\u201312 students.\n\nRather than having physical education classes, St. Paul's requires all its students to play sports. These sports range from the internationally competing crew team to intramural hockey.\n\nThroughout the Fall, Winter and Spring Terms, students attend twelve seated meals, at which formal attire is required. Seven students and a faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, and the table is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisers and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their adviser), either at the adviser's home or at the Upper Dining Hall. The school supplies money for one meal in town.\n\nIn the evenings, meetings are held for clubs and activities, music ensembles like the Chorus and Band, theater rehearsals, [[a capella]] groups (the all-male Testostertones, the all-female Mad Hatters, and the co-ed Deli Line), the Debate Team, and other extra-curriculars.\n\n==Socialization==\nAccording to [[Shamus Khan]], author of ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School'' (2010) and a [[sociology|sociologist]] who is a St. Paul's alumnus, students are [[socialization|socialized]] to function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society.

There is a school prayer:<poem>\"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life, we may never forget to be kind.\nHelp us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others.\nThrough Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.\"<ref name = Khan/>{{rp|75}}<ref name = SPSPrayer >[https://www.sps.edu/ftpimages/36/download/download_group4028_id133462.pdf The School Prayer] PDF file from the website of the school, accessed August 22, 2015</ref></poem>\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:Alumni Parade.JPG|left|thumbnail|x228px|The 2005 Alumni Parade (see below) from all the way in the back.]]\nSt. Paul's is home to many long-standing traditions. Near the start of the school year, the Rector announces a surprise holiday&nbsp;\u2014 Cricket Holiday&nbsp;\u2014 in morning Chapel. Classes are canceled for the day and the Rector leads new students and faculty on a tour of the woods surrounding the School. Tuesdays are generally preferred for the holiday by the Rector as students who leave the grounds are forced to return by the start time of Seated Meal or Advisee Dinner. The tradition dates back to the first Rector, Henry Augustus Coit, who preferred [[cricket]] over [[baseball]] as a \"more refined sport\".\n\nDuring February, the Missionary Society (the school's community service organization) plans and announces Mish Holiday. The holiday is announced the day before, the evening is given over to a theme dance, and the next day is a day off from school. The Missionary Society has used extravagant stunts to announce the holiday, including, in the past, fireworks over the Lower School Pond and a plane trailing a \"Happy Mish!\" banner.\n\nStudents at St. Paul's are assigned to one of three \"clubs\" for their time at St. Paul's&nbsp;\u2014 \"Isthmian,\" \"Delphian\" or \"Old Hundred\". Those who participate in \"club sports\" (intramural) play for their club. Students who participate in crew are also assigned to one of two \"Boat Clubs\"&nbsp;\u2014 \"Halcyon\" or \"Shattuck\". Descendants of graduates are assigned to the same clubs as their relatives.\n\nThe annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the \"Dorm Run\" but now officially named the \"Charles B. Morgan Run\", takes place late in Fall Term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison '07.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sps.edu/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=412066&L4=2&tabs=athletics |title=''SPS Today'': 'School Pride Shows in Annual Club/House Race', 15 Nov 2007 |publisher= |accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring a weekend in the Fall Term, the Student Council holds Fall Ball, a dinner/dance known among students as the Cocktails. On the same night, there is a talent show that focuses on fifth formers (eleventh graders). Fifth former MCs are selected by their form representatives to host the show.\n\nDuring the Winter Term, the school holds the annual Fiske Cup Competition. Each participating dorm produces a student-directed and performed play. Most plays are held in dorm common rooms.\n\nIn the Spring Term, St. Paul's holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists' speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize. Alumnus [[John Kerry]] achieved this distinction during his sixth form year.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/us/prep-school-peers-found-kerry-talented-ambitious-and-apart.html|title=Prep School Peers Found Kerry Talented, Ambitious and Apart|first=Todd S.|last=Purdum|date=16 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn the last night of the term, students gather in the Chapel at 9 p.m. for the Last Night service. At the Last Night service for Spring Term, the last night of school before summer vacation, the faculty lines up outside the Chapel after the service and students shake hands with every member as they exit. On the Sixth Formers' last night on campus, they gather as a class in the Old Chapel. At the conclusion of the service, the rest of the student body waits outside to congratulate them and say their goodbyes.\n\nDuring Anniversary Weekend, held on the first weekend of June, alumni converge on the school for get-togethers, reunions, and the annual Alumni Parade. Each form (class) marches down Chapel Road in chronological order, starting with the oldest living alumni. In the back of this long column is the about-to-graduate Sixth Form.\n\nSt. Paul's students once had a close relationship with [[jam band]]s like the [[Grateful Dead]]. Some of the slang peculiar to St. Paul's originated as the \"Pyramid Dialect\" among St. Paul's students and alumni who followed the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 shows in Egypt.<ref>Shenk, D. and Silberman, S.

Wednesdays and Saturdays, however, are half-days, with athletic games or practices in the afternoons. The school has four grades, known at St. Paul's as \"forms\". For example, \"Third Form\" corresponds to ninth grade, up through \"Sixth Form\", which corresponds to twelfth grade.\n\nFor Paulies, as St. Paul's students are colloquially known, the four full days each week begin with Chapel. The mandatory [[interfaith]] half-hour meeting involves a reading, speech or music presentation, and community-wide announcements.\n\nSt. Paul's conducts its Humanities classes using the [[Harkness table|Harkness method]], which encourages discussion between students and the teacher, and between students.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Harkness Table: Schools |url=http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |accessdate=26 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510091829/http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |archivedate=10 May 2014 }}</ref> The average class size according to the school's website is 10\u201312 students.\n\nRather than having physical education classes, St. Paul's requires all its students to play sports. These sports range from the internationally competing crew team to intramural hockey.\n\nThroughout the Fall, Winter and Spring Terms, students attend twelve seated meals, at which formal attire is required. Seven students and a faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, and the table is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisers and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their adviser), either at the adviser's home or at the Upper Dining Hall. The school supplies money for one meal in town.\n\nIn the evenings, meetings are held for clubs and activities, music ensembles like the Chorus and Band, theater rehearsals, [[a capella]] groups (the all-male Testostertones, the all-female Mad Hatters, and the co-ed Deli Line), the Debate Team, and other extra-curriculars.\n\n==Socialization==\nAccording to [[Shamus Khan]], author of ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School'' (2010) and a [[sociology|sociologist]] who is a St. Paul's alumnus, students are [[socialization|socialized]] to function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society.

There is a school prayer:<poem>\"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life, we may never forget to be kind.\nHelp us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others.\nThrough Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.\"<ref name = Khan/>{{rp|75}}<ref name = SPSPrayer >[https://www.sps.edu/ftpimages/36/download/download_group4028_id133462.pdf The School Prayer] PDF file from the website of the school, accessed August 22, 2015</ref></poem>\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:Alumni Parade.JPG|left|thumbnail|x228px|The 2005 Alumni Parade (see below) from all the way in the back.]]\nSt. Paul's is home to many long-standing traditions. Near the start of the school year, the Rector announces a surprise holiday&nbsp;\u2014 Cricket Holiday&nbsp;\u2014 in morning Chapel. Classes are canceled for the day and the Rector leads new students and faculty on a tour of the woods surrounding the School. Tuesdays are generally preferred for the holiday by the Rector as students who leave the grounds are forced to return by the start time of Seated Meal or Advisee Dinner. The tradition dates back to the first Rector, Henry Augustus Coit, who preferred [[cricket]] over [[baseball]] as a \"more refined sport\".\n\nDuring February, the Missionary Society (the school's community service organization) plans and announces Mish Holiday. The holiday is announced the day before, the evening is given over to a theme dance, and the next day is a day off from school. The Missionary Society has used extravagant stunts to announce the holiday, including, in the past, fireworks over the Lower School Pond and a plane trailing a \"Happy Mish!\" banner.\n\nStudents at St. Paul's are assigned to one of three \"clubs\" for their time at St. Paul's&nbsp;\u2014 \"Isthmian,\" \"Delphian\" or \"Old Hundred\". Those who participate in \"club sports\" (intramural) play for their club. Students who participate in crew are also assigned to one of two \"Boat Clubs\"&nbsp;\u2014 \"Halcyon\" or \"Shattuck\". Descendants of graduates are assigned to the same clubs as their relatives.\n\nThe annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the \"Dorm Run\" but now officially named the \"Charles B. Morgan Run\", takes place late in Fall Term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison '07.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sps.edu/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=412066&L4=2&tabs=athletics |title=''SPS Today'': 'School Pride Shows in Annual Club/House Race', 15 Nov 2007 |publisher= |accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring a weekend in the Fall Term, the Student Council holds Fall Ball, a dinner/dance known among students as the Cocktails. On the same night, there is a talent show that focuses on fifth formers (eleventh graders). Fifth former MCs are selected by their form representatives to host the show.\n\nDuring the Winter Term, the school holds the annual Fiske Cup Competition. Each participating dorm produces a student-directed and performed play. Most plays are held in dorm common rooms.\n\nIn the Spring Term, St. Paul's holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists' speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize. Alumnus [[John Kerry]] achieved this distinction during his sixth form year.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/us/prep-school-peers-found-kerry-talented-ambitious-and-apart.html|title=Prep School Peers Found Kerry Talented, Ambitious and Apart|first=Todd S.|last=Purdum|date=16 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn the last night of the term, students gather in the Chapel at 9 p.m. for the Last Night service. At the Last Night service for Spring Term, the last night of school before summer vacation, the faculty lines up outside the Chapel after the service and students shake hands with every member as they exit. On the Sixth Formers' last night on campus, they gather as a class in the Old Chapel. At the conclusion of the service, the rest of the student body waits outside to congratulate them and say their goodbyes.\n\nDuring Anniversary Weekend, held on the first weekend of June, alumni converge on the school for get-togethers, reunions, and the annual Alumni Parade. Each form (class) marches down Chapel Road in chronological order, starting with the oldest living alumni. In the back of this long column is the about-to-graduate Sixth Form.\n\nSt. Paul's students once had a close relationship with [[jam band]]s like the [[Grateful Dead]]. Some of the slang peculiar to St. Paul's originated as the \"Pyramid Dialect\" among St. Paul's students and alumni who followed the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 shows in Egypt.<ref>Shenk, D. and Silberman, S.

Declines in well-being and [[life satisfaction]] were found in older adolescents who passively consumed social media; however, these were not shown in those who were more actively engaged.

With the platform social media provides, users can freely express their emotions. However, not all is great with social media, it can also cause [[discrimination]] and [[cyberbullying]]. Discrimination and cyberbullying are more prevalent online because people have more courage to write something bold rather than to say it in person.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://education.findlaw.com/student-conduct-and-discipline/cyberbullying-and-social-media.html | title=Cyberbullying and Social Media}}</ref> There is also a strong positive correlation between social anxiety and social media usage.

Other motivations include information seeking and identity formation, as well as voyeurism and cyber-stalking. For some individuals, social media can become \"the single most important activity that they engage in\". This can be related to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], with basic human needs often met from social media. Positive-outcome expectations and limited self-control of social media use can develop into \"addictive\" social media use.

With some of the negative effects that the smartphone has caused, one being the term \u201cphubbing,\u201d which is snubbing someone while an individual check their smartphone in the middle of a real-life conversation. The study was used to check the direct and indirect associations of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and trait fear of missing out with phubbing via state fear of missing out and problematic Instagram use. The total number of 423 adolescents and emerging adults between the ages of 14 to 21 years old (53% female) participated in the study.

Participants preferred Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook reported higher scores of problematic social media use. The study concluded that YouTube was the only platform with a net positive rating based on 14 questions related to health and well-being, followed by Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and finally Instagram.

Loneliness and depressive symptoms declined with the group that had limited social media usage. Students with depressive symptoms had a much higher impact with social media restriction if they began with higher levels of depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Melissa G.|last2=Marx|first2=Rachel|last3=Lipson|first3=Courtney|last4=Young|first4=Jordyn|date=2018|title=No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=751\u2013768|doi=10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751|issn=0736-7236}}</ref>\n\nSome people may be starting to come to grips with the fact that social media isn\u2019t so great for mental health. Others may think that getting on it will give them a boost\u2014but especially depending on how you spend your time on it, you may well feel worse after using. Plenty of studies have found correlations between higher social media use and poorer mental health, including depression, anxiety, feelings of loneliness and isolation, lower self-esteem, and even suicidality.\n\nBut two new studies underline this reality by showing not just correlation, but causation\u2014in other words, that tweaking your time on social media actually has measurable effects on mental health.\n\nThe first study, carried out at the University of Pennsylvania and published in the ''Journal of Social and Clinical'' Psychology, asked 140 undergraduates to either continue their regular use of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, or to limit each one to 10 minutes per day (30 minutes total). The participants also provided data from their phones to show precisely how much time they were actually spending on the apps, rather than relying on memory, which can be unreliable.\n\nBefore and after the \u201cintervention,\u201d the participants also filled out questionnaires so the researchers could understand how they were doing psychologically\u2014they were particularly interested in anxiety, depression, loneliness, and the famous \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d or FOMO.\n\nAs the researchers expected, people who limited their social media use to 30 minutes felt significantly better after the three-week period, reporting reduced depression and loneliness, especially those who came into the study with higher levels of depression. Interestingly, both groups reported less FOMO and less anxiety in the end, which the team suggests may just be a resulting benefit of increased self-monitoring.\n\n== Scales and Measures ==\nProblematic Social Media Use has been a concern for over a decade. There have been several scales developed and validated that help to understand the issues regarding problematic social media use. One of the first scales was an eight-item scale that was used for Facebook use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=2007-07-01|title=The Benefits of Facebook \"Friends:\" Social Capital and College Students' Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/12/4/1143/4582961|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143\u20131168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x}}</ref>  The Facebook Intensity Scale (FBI) was used multiple times and showed good reliability and validity.

This and other relationships between [[digital media use and mental health]] have been considerably researched, debated, and discussed among experts in several disciplines, and have generated controversy in medical, scientific, and technological communities.

With the platform social media provides, users can freely express their emotions. However, not all is great with social media, it can also cause [[discrimination]] and [[cyberbullying]].

Other motivations include information seeking and identity formation, as well as voyeurism and cyber-stalking. For some individuals, social media can become \"the single most important activity that they engage in\". This can be related to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], with basic human needs often met from social media. Positive-outcome expectations and limited self-control of social media use can develop into \"addictive\" social media use.

Students were asked questions about their well-being on the scale of:  \u201csocial support,\u201d \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d \u201cloneliness,\u201d \u201canxiety,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201cself-esteem,\u201d and \u201cautonomy and self-acceptance.\u201d The conclusion of the study revealed that limiting social media usage on a mobile phone to 10 minutes per platform per day had a significant impact on well-being. Loneliness and depressive symptoms declined with the group that had limited social media usage. Students with depressive symptoms had a much higher impact with social media restriction if they began with higher levels of depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Melissa G.|last2=Marx|first2=Rachel|last3=Lipson|first3=Courtney|last4=Young|first4=Jordyn|date=2018|title=No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=751\u2013768|doi=10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751|issn=0736-7236}}</ref>\n\nSome people may be starting to come to grips with the fact that social media isn\u2019t so great for mental health. Others may think that getting on it will give them a boost\u2014but especially depending on how you spend your time on it, you may well feel worse after using. Plenty of studies have found correlations between higher social media use and poorer mental health, including depression, anxiety, feelings of loneliness and isolation, lower self-esteem, and even suicidality.\n\nBut two new studies underline this reality by showing not just correlation, but causation\u2014in other words, that tweaking your time on social media actually has measurable effects on mental health.\n\nThe first study, carried out at the University of Pennsylvania and published in the ''Journal of Social and Clinical'' Psychology, asked 140 undergraduates to either continue their regular use of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, or to limit each one to 10 minutes per day (30 minutes total). The participants also provided data from their phones to show precisely how much time they were actually spending on the apps, rather than relying on memory, which can be unreliable.\n\nBefore and after the \u201cintervention,\u201d the participants also filled out questionnaires so the researchers could understand how they were doing psychologically\u2014they were particularly interested in anxiety, depression, loneliness, and the famous \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d or FOMO.\n\nAs the researchers expected, people who limited their social media use to 30 minutes felt significantly better after the three-week period, reporting reduced depression and loneliness, especially those who came into the study with higher levels of depression. Interestingly, both groups reported less FOMO and less anxiety in the end, which the team suggests may just be a resulting benefit of increased self-monitoring.\n\n== Scales and Measures ==\nProblematic Social Media Use has been a concern for over a decade. There have been several scales developed and validated that help to understand the issues regarding problematic social media use. One of the first scales was an eight-item scale that was used for Facebook use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=2007-07-01|title=The Benefits of Facebook \"Friends:\" Social Capital and College Students' Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/12/4/1143/4582961|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143\u20131168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x}}</ref>  The Facebook Intensity Scale (FBI) was used multiple times and showed good reliability and validity.

The MFIS also had good reliability and validity, but the scale was directed toward the use of Facebook, and social media is far more than just one platform. The Social Networking Activity Intensity Scale (SNAIS) was created to look at the frequency of use of several platforms and investigated three facets of engagement with a 14-item survey. This scale looked at the purposes of use both entertainment and social function, and the scale as a whole had acceptable reliability and validity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jibin|last2=Lau|first2=Joseph T.

They are attracted to the positive outcomes they receive on social media.\n\nBased on those models, Xu and Tan suggest that the transition from normal to problematic social media use occurs when a person relies on it to relieve stress, loneliness, depression, or provide continuous rewards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.aisnet.org/Default.aspx?url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1216&context=icis2012|title=Why do i keep checking Facebook: Effects of message characteristics on the formation of social network services addiction|last=Xu|first=H.|last2=Tan|first2=B.C.Y.|date=2012|website=Association for Information Systems|location=Behavioral Addictions: Chapter 6 - Social Networking Addiction: An Overview of Preliminary Findings|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Management ==\nNo established treatments exist, but from research from the related entity of [[Internet addiction disorder]], treatments have been considered, with further research needed.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Andreassen|first=Cecilie|last2=Pallesen|first2=Stale|date=June 2014|title=Social Network Site Addiction - An Overview|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|volume=20|issue=25|pages=4053\u20134061|doi=10.2174/13816128113199990616|issn=1381-6128|pmid=24001298}}</ref> [[Screen time]] recommendations for children and families have been developed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx|title=How to Make a Family Media Use Plan|website=HealthyChildren.org|access-date=2019-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606111436/https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx|archive-date=2019-06-06|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Korioth|first=Trisha|date=2018-12-12|title=Family Media Plan helps parents set boundaries for kids|url=http://www.aappublications.org/news/2016/10/21/MediaParents102116|journal=AAP News|name-list-format=vanc|access-date=2019-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109155630/http://www.aappublications.org/news/2016/10/21/MediaParents102116|archive-date=2019-01-09|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nPossible therapeutic interventions published by Andreasson include:\n\n* Self-help interventions, including application-specific timers;\n* Cognitive behavioral therapy; and\n* Organizational and schooling support.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andreassen|first=Cecilie Schou|date=2015-06-01|title=Online Social Network Site Addiction: A Comprehensive Review|journal=Current Addiction Reports|volume=2|issue=2|pages=175\u2013184|doi=10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9|issn=2196-2952}}</ref>\n\nMedications have not been shown to be effective in randomized, controlled trials for the related conditions of Internet addiction disorder or [[gaming disorder]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Technology firms ===\nAs awareness of these issues has increased, many technology and medical communities have continued to work together to develop novel solutions.

One such character was \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" matriarch [[Thelma Harper|Thelma Harper/Mama]], the cold, unaffectionate mother of the neurotic, misfortunate, [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) although Lawrence is 16 years younger than Burnett. Thelma Harper was the central character of the television situation comedy series  ''[[Mama's Family]]'' on [[NBC]] and, later, in first-run syndication. She also starred in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom series ''[[The Cool Kids (TV series)|The Cool Kids]]''.\n\nIn 1973, she became a [[one-hit wonder]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. chart]] with \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\". It reached number one on both the United States and Canada charts. Lawrence has multiple [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning one in 1976.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1976/outstanding-continuing-or-single-performance-by-a-supporting-actress-in-variety-or-music|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\nShe is also a multiple [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominee, all for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. Lawrence has made numerous post-''Mama's Family'' guest TV show appearances in her famed Thelma Harper/Mama role.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Lawrence appeared as the character in a special sketch for ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/movies-specials-more/video/categories/betty-whites-second-annual-90th-birthday-party|title=Video Gallery|publisher=NBC|accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> In addition, she regularly hosts an untelevised stage show, titled ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\n==Early life==\nLawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in [[Inglewood, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/specialty_acts/Vicki-Lawrence.htm |title=VICKI LAWRENCE booking \u2013 Celebrity Actors, Comedians \u2013 Corporate Entertainment Booking|publisher=Delafont.com |date=1949-03-26|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> the daughter of Anne Alene (n\u00e9e Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for [[Max Factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Vicki-Lawrence.html|title=Vicki Lawrence Biography |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> The family surname was legally changed to \"Lawrence\" when Vicki was young.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> She is a graduate of [[Morningside High School]] in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a [[dental hygienist]]. She attended [[UCLA]] while on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', and  changed her major to [[theater arts]], but dropped out after two years.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group [[The Young Americans]]. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and performing on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young [[Carol Burnett]]. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on [[Carol Burnett Show|her upcoming show]]. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part, specifically for playing Chrissy in the \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nAfter Lawrence was given the job on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', both Burnett and [[Harvey Korman]] took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the \"[[Harvard University|Harvard]] school of comedy\". Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Acting===\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|right|225px|On ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', L-R: [[Carol Burnett]], Vicki Lawrence, and [[Dinah Shore]] in the sketch \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\", 1977.]]\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper, 2009]]\nAs a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After ''The Carol Burnett Show'' ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.\n\nHer portrayal of the Mama character on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"The Family\" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]'', elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the [[Eunice Higgins]] character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\nLawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Major Dad]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''. Between the NBC and syndication runs of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot ''Anything for Love'', which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred [[Lauren Tewes]] and [[Rebeca Arthur]]. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and [[Tim Conway]] in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on ''Nunsense Jamboree'' that originally aired on TNN in 1998.\n\nLawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of [[Robby Ray Stewart]] and grandmother of [[Jackson Stewart (character)|Jackson]] and [[Miley Stewart]]) in the hit [[Disney]] series ''Hannah Montana'' alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nLawrence played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. Lawrence played Dan's old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of ''Roseanne''. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the [[Anne Robinson]] version of ''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two, but ended up losing to [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]\n\n===Music===\nAs a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated ''Johnny Mann's Stand Up And Cheer'' program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", a song written by her first husband [[Bobby Russell]], which was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314 314\u2013315]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314\n}}</ref> During the last episode of the sixth season of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (March 24, 1973), Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, ''[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (Vicki Lawrence album)|The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]'', was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was re-recorded by [[Reba McEntire]] for her 1991 album [[For My Broken Heart]]. McEntire released the track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at #12 on the country chart, aided in part by a highly cinematic music video.\n\n\"He Did With Me\", Lawrence's followup to \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the [[adult contemporary music]] charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with \"Ships in the Night\" (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label with \"The Other Woman\" (number 81).\n\nIn 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, ''Ships in the Night''. The label was in the process of being bought out by [[Arista Records|Arista]], and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence's first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.\n\nShe released a [[disco]] album entitled ''Newborn Woman'' late in 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit \"Don't Stop the Music\".\n\n===Hosting and other work===\nAs an emcee, she hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', as well as an unsold pilot for [[Mark Goodson]] Productions, 1990's ''Body Talk'', and has also appeared often as a popular panelist on such game shows as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Password Plus]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'', and various incarnations of the [[Pyramid (game show)|''Pyramid'' game show]], where she was known for verbally sparring with host [[Dick Clark]] on numerous occasions. She also appeared on the 1986-89 version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper. Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] for the eponymous ''[[Vicki!]]'' (1992\u20131994), but the show ended after two seasons amid creative battles with her syndicator. In 1997, she hosted ''[[Fox After Breakfast]],'' which was renamed ''The Vicki Lawrence Show'',<ref name=\"Fox After Breakfast\">{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Mark |title=Fox remakes \u2018Breakfast\u2019|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-remakes-breakfast-1116678259/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref> but was cancelled five weeks later due to low ratings.<ref name=\"Vicki Lawrence Show\">{{cite web |last1=Littlton |first1=Cynthia |title=Fox axes \u2018Vicki\u2019; ankles ayem|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-axes-vicki-ankles-ayem-111662675/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>  \n\nShe tours the country with her \"two-woman\" show with the first half as herself and the second half done as Mama.  She can also be seen on TV in an infomercial for the Big Boss Grill. She is also known for her voice-over work as Flo on the animated series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]''.\n\nIn 2018, Lawrence was seen promoting ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and other classic television series on the [[MeTV]] television network.\n\n==Personal life==\nLawrence was married to singer and songwriter Bobby Russell from 1972 to 1974. Lawrence's second husband is Hollywood make-up artist Al Schultz, to whom she has been married since November 16, 1974, and with whom she has two children, Courtney Allison Schultz (born May 5, 1975) and Garrett Lawrence Schultz (born July 3, 1977).\n\nLawrence and her family appeared on ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity Family Feud:Joey Lawrence vs. Mario Lopez/Ed Asner vs. Vicki Lawrence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4854762|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=2015-08-02}}</ref>\n\nLawrence was diagnosed with [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] (CIU) around 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIU&You|url=http://www.ciuandyou.com|publisher=Ciuandyou.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref> She teamed with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] and has become the spokesperson for the campaign CIU & You.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedienne, Actress Vicki Lawrence Teams Up with AAFA To Talk About Chronic Skin Condition|url=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7388251-aafa-ciu-and-you-campaign|publisher=Multivu.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared on ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' in 2015 to relay her story and talk about CIU and promote the CIU & You campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=VICKI LAWRENCE\u2019S CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION|url=http://www.thedoctorstv.com/articles/2959-vicki-lawrence-s-chronic-health-condition|publisher=Thedoctorstv.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Selected film and television roles\n|-\n!

One such character was \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" matriarch [[Thelma Harper|Thelma Harper/Mama]], the cold, unaffectionate mother of the neurotic, misfortunate, [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) although Lawrence is 16 years younger than Burnett. Thelma Harper was the central character of the television situation comedy series  ''[[Mama's Family]]'' on [[NBC]] and, later, in first-run syndication. She also starred in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom series ''[[The Cool Kids (TV series)|The Cool Kids]]''.\n\nIn 1973, she became a [[one-hit wonder]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. chart]] with \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\". It reached number one on both the United States and Canada charts. Lawrence has multiple [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning one in 1976.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1976/outstanding-continuing-or-single-performance-by-a-supporting-actress-in-variety-or-music|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\nShe is also a multiple [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominee, all for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. Lawrence has made numerous post-''Mama's Family'' guest TV show appearances in her famed Thelma Harper/Mama role.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Lawrence appeared as the character in a special sketch for ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/movies-specials-more/video/categories/betty-whites-second-annual-90th-birthday-party|title=Video Gallery|publisher=NBC|accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> In addition, she regularly hosts an untelevised stage show, titled ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\n==Early life==\nLawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in [[Inglewood, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/specialty_acts/Vicki-Lawrence.htm |title=VICKI LAWRENCE booking \u2013 Celebrity Actors, Comedians \u2013 Corporate Entertainment Booking|publisher=Delafont.com |date=1949-03-26|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> the daughter of Anne Alene (n\u00e9e Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for [[Max Factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Vicki-Lawrence.html|title=Vicki Lawrence Biography |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> The family surname was legally changed to \"Lawrence\" when Vicki was young.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> She is a graduate of [[Morningside High School]] in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a [[dental hygienist]]. She attended [[UCLA]] while on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', and  changed her major to [[theater arts]], but dropped out after two years.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group [[The Young Americans]]. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and performing on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young [[Carol Burnett]]. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on [[Carol Burnett Show|her upcoming show]]. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part, specifically for playing Chrissy in the \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nAfter Lawrence was given the job on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', both Burnett and [[Harvey Korman]] took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the \"[[Harvard University|Harvard]] school of comedy\". Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Acting===\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|right|225px|On ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', L-R: [[Carol Burnett]], Vicki Lawrence, and [[Dinah Shore]] in the sketch \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\", 1977.]]\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper, 2009]]\nAs a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After ''The Carol Burnett Show'' ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.\n\nHer portrayal of the Mama character on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"The Family\" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]'', elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the [[Eunice Higgins]] character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\nLawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Major Dad]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''. Between the NBC and syndication runs of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot ''Anything for Love'', which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred [[Lauren Tewes]] and [[Rebeca Arthur]]. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and [[Tim Conway]] in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on ''Nunsense Jamboree'' that originally aired on TNN in 1998.\n\nLawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of [[Robby Ray Stewart]] and grandmother of [[Jackson Stewart (character)|Jackson]] and [[Miley Stewart]]) in the hit [[Disney]] series ''Hannah Montana'' alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nLawrence played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. Lawrence played Dan's old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of ''Roseanne''. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the [[Anne Robinson]] version of ''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two, but ended up losing to [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]\n\n===Music===\nAs a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated ''Johnny Mann's Stand Up And Cheer'' program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", a song written by her first husband [[Bobby Russell]], which was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314 314\u2013315]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314\n}}</ref> During the last episode of the sixth season of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (March 24, 1973), Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, ''[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (Vicki Lawrence album)|The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]'', was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was re-recorded by [[Reba McEntire]] for her 1991 album [[For My Broken Heart]]. McEntire released the track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at #12 on the country chart, aided in part by a highly cinematic music video.\n\n\"He Did With Me\", Lawrence's followup to \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the [[adult contemporary music]] charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with \"Ships in the Night\" (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label with \"The Other Woman\" (number 81).\n\nIn 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, ''Ships in the Night''. The label was in the process of being bought out by [[Arista Records|Arista]], and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence's first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.\n\nShe released a [[disco]] album entitled ''Newborn Woman'' late in 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit \"Don't Stop the Music\".\n\n===Hosting and other work===\nAs an emcee, she hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', as well as an unsold pilot for [[Mark Goodson]] Productions, 1990's ''Body Talk'', and has also appeared often as a popular panelist on such game shows as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Password Plus]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'', and various incarnations of the [[Pyramid (game show)|''Pyramid'' game show]], where she was known for verbally sparring with host [[Dick Clark]] on numerous occasions. She also appeared on the 1986-89 version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper. Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] for the eponymous ''[[Vicki!]]'' (1992\u20131994), but the show ended after two seasons amid creative battles with her syndicator.

Due to the presence of several [[active fault|active geologic faults]] and the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]], there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region, such as [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury and property damage.\n\nIn the [[Pre-Columbian era]], Central America was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area|Isthmo-Colombian]] peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages to the [[Americas]], Spain began to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonize the Americas]]. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) were governed by the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] from [[Mexico City]] as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa|Juan de O'Donoj\u00fa]] signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], which established New Spain's independence from Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/spain-accepts-mexican-independence|title=Spain accepts Mexican independence|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> On 15 September 1821, the [[Act of Independence of Central America]] was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the [[Spanish Empire]] and provide for the establishment of a new [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American state]]. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]) were annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]]; however, in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] until 1838.\n\nIn 1838, [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]] became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent autonomous countries, followed by [[El Salvador]] in 1841, [[Panama]] in 1903 and [[Belize]] in 1981{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. Despite the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], there is anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that [[Salvadorans]], [[Panamanians]], [[Costa Ricans]], [[Guatemalans]], [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]] continue to maintain a Central American identity. For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. It is not unusual to write \"C.A.\" after the country's name in formal and informal contexts. Governments in the region sometimes reinforce this sense of belonging to Central America in its citizens. For example, automobile licence plates in many of the region's countries include the moniker, ''Centroamerica,'' alongside the country's name. [[Belizeans]] are mostly associated to be culturally [[West Indian]] rather than Central American.\n\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Central American flags\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Nuvola Salvadoran flag.svg|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Nuvola Guatemalan flag.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Nuvola Honduran flag.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Nuvola Nicaraguan flag.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Nuvola Costa Rican state flag.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Nuvola Panaman flag.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Nuvola Belizean flag.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\n== Different definitions ==\n[[File:Flag-map of Central America.svg|thumb|[[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and [[Belize]] are historically the seven nations in Central America politically, geographically and culturally.]]\n\n\"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\n* The [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas]] defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico.<ref name=UN2017 />\n* [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] is usually thought to comprise [[Mexico]] to the north of the 7 states of ''Central America'' as well as [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] to the south.

Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some<ref name=\"Hoopes&Fonseca2003\" /> culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].\n\nFollowing the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya territory]] in 1523. Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] commenced the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of northern Central America]] for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Beginning with his arrival in [[Soconusco]] in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]]. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms \u2013 the [[Kowoj]] and the [[Itza people]] \u2013 were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1538, Spain established the [[Real Audiencia of Panama#First installation|Real Audiencia of Panama]], which had jurisdiction over all land from the [[Strait of Magellan]] to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Audiencia Real de Guatemala]]''. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in [[Antigua Guatemala]], was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire|captaincy general]] and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras|present-day Belize]] and Panama.\n\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a [[1811 Independence Movement|rebellion in 1811]] which began in the [[Intendant#Spain and the Spanish Empire|intendancy]] of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the [[Act of Independence of Central America]]. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\n\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|250px|The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms of Central America was inspired by the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range of [[El Salvador]], visible from the city of [[Sonsonate]], which became the capital of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] in 1834.]]\n\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]]. When the [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Emperor of Mexico]] abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], [[Mosquito Coast]], and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco.

Panama was part of the [[Province of Tierra Firme]] from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed ''Audiencia Real de Panama''. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], the capital of which was located at [[Bogot\u00e1|Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]]. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|military and political struggles]] took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the [[Republic of New Granada]]. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as [[Panama State]], first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the [[Granadine Confederation]], and finally within the [[United States of Colombia]]. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the [[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the [[Isthmus Department]]. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama]] on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala.

The Middle America Trench is situated some {{convert|60-160|km|mi|sp=us}} off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.<ref name=Astiz1987 /> For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1942 Guatemala earthquake|1942]], [[1956 Nicaragua earthquake|1956]], [[1982 El Salvador earthquake|1982]], [[1992 Nicaragua earthquake|1992]], [[2001 El Salvador earthquakes|2001]], [[2007 Guatemala earthquake|2007]], [[2012 Guatemala earthquake|2012]], [[October 2014 Nicaragua earthquake|2014]], and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\n\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The [[Motagua Fault]] is an onshore continuation of the [[Cayman Trough]] which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This [[transform fault]] cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near [[Acapulco]]. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|1717]], [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|1773]], [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976]], [[1980 Honduras earthquake|1980]], and [[2009 Honduras earthquake|2009]].\n\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the [[Chixoy-Polochic Fault]], which runs parallel to, and roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.<ref name=White1985 />\n\n[[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931]] and [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972]].\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Ethnic groups in Central America|Latin Americans}}\n\nThe population of Central America is estimated at 47,448,333<!-- 2016 --> as of {{UN Population|Year}}.{{UN Population|ref}} With an area of {{convert|523780|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},<ref name=handbook2013 /> it has a population density of {{convert|91|/km2|/sqmi|sp=us}}.

The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.\n\nCosta Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Clear left}}\n\n== Economy ==\n{{See also|Economy of Belize|Economy of Costa Rica|Economy of El Salvador|Economy of Guatemala|Economy of Honduras|Economy of Nicaragua|Economy of Panama}}\n[[File:Federal Republic of Central America 1835 4 Real.jpg|thumb|Federal Republic of Central America, 4 Escudos (1835).

In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from [[El Salvador]], 55 per cent from [[Guatemala]], and 65 per cent from [[Honduras]]. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.<ref name=\"insumisos.com\">https://www.insumisos.com/diplo/NODE/663.HTM</ref>\n\nThey are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime.

Due to the presence of several [[active fault|active geologic faults]] and the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]], there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region, such as [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury and property damage.\n\nIn the [[Pre-Columbian era]], Central America was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area|Isthmo-Colombian]] peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages to the [[Americas]], Spain began to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonize the Americas]]. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) were governed by the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] from [[Mexico City]] as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa|Juan de O'Donoj\u00fa]] signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], which established New Spain's independence from Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/spain-accepts-mexican-independence|title=Spain accepts Mexican independence|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> On 15 September 1821, the [[Act of Independence of Central America]] was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the [[Spanish Empire]] and provide for the establishment of a new [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American state]]. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]) were annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]]; however, in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] until 1838.\n\nIn 1838, [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]] became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent autonomous countries, followed by [[El Salvador]] in 1841, [[Panama]] in 1903 and [[Belize]] in 1981{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. Despite the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], there is anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that [[Salvadorans]], [[Panamanians]], [[Costa Ricans]], [[Guatemalans]], [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]] continue to maintain a Central American identity. For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. It is not unusual to write \"C.A.\" after the country's name in formal and informal contexts. Governments in the region sometimes reinforce this sense of belonging to Central America in its citizens. For example, automobile licence plates in many of the region's countries include the moniker, ''Centroamerica,'' alongside the country's name. [[Belizeans]] are mostly associated to be culturally [[West Indian]] rather than Central American.\n\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Central American flags\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Nuvola Salvadoran flag.svg|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Nuvola Guatemalan flag.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Nuvola Honduran flag.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Nuvola Nicaraguan flag.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Nuvola Costa Rican state flag.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Nuvola Panaman flag.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Nuvola Belizean flag.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\n== Different definitions ==\n[[File:Flag-map of Central America.svg|thumb|[[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and [[Belize]] are historically the seven nations in Central America politically, geographically and culturally.]]\n\n\"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\n* The [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas]] defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico.<ref name=UN2017 />\n* [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] is usually thought to comprise [[Mexico]] to the north of the 7 states of ''Central America'' as well as [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] to the south.

Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some<ref name=\"Hoopes&Fonseca2003\" /> culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].\n\nFollowing the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya territory]] in 1523. Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] commenced the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of northern Central America]] for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Beginning with his arrival in [[Soconusco]] in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]]. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms \u2013 the [[Kowoj]] and the [[Itza people]] \u2013 were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1538, Spain established the [[Real Audiencia of Panama#First installation|Real Audiencia of Panama]], which had jurisdiction over all land from the [[Strait of Magellan]] to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Audiencia Real de Guatemala]]''. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in [[Antigua Guatemala]], was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire|captaincy general]] and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras|present-day Belize]] and Panama.\n\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a [[1811 Independence Movement|rebellion in 1811]] which began in the [[Intendant#Spain and the Spanish Empire|intendancy]] of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the [[Act of Independence of Central America]]. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\n\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|250px|The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms of Central America was inspired by the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range of [[El Salvador]], visible from the city of [[Sonsonate]], which became the capital of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] in 1834.]]\n\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]]. When the [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Emperor of Mexico]] abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], [[Mosquito Coast]], and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=100 heights=100 mode=nolines caption=\"Historic Coat of Arms of Central American Unions\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Escudo de las Provincias Unidas del Centro de Am\u00e9rica.svg|The United Provinces of Central America\nFile:Escudo de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Centro Am\u00e9rica.svg|[[Federal Republic of Central America]]\nFile:Escudo de la Representaci\u00f3n Nacional de Centroam\u00e9rica.svg|National Representation of Central America\nFile:Coat of arms of the Greater Republic of Central America (1898).svg|[[Greater Republic of Central America]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=80 heights=80 mode=nolines caption=\"Coat of Arms of modern Central America\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Coat of arms of Guatemala.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Coat of arms of El Salvador.svg|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Honduras.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Nicaragua.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Costa Rica.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Panama.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Belize.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\nThe territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see [[History of Belize (1506\u20131862)]].

It became independent as Belize in 1981.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the [[Province of Tierra Firme]] from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed ''Audiencia Real de Panama''. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], the capital of which was located at [[Bogot\u00e1|Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]]. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|military and political struggles]] took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the [[Republic of New Granada]]. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as [[Panama State]], first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the [[Granadine Confederation]], and finally within the [[United States of Colombia]]. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the [[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the [[Isthmus Department]]. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama]] on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala.

Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.\n\nMost of Central America rests atop the [[Caribbean Plate]]. This [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] converges with the [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], and [[North American Plate|North American]] plates to form the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction]] zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some {{convert|60-160|km|mi|sp=us}} off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.<ref name=Astiz1987 /> For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1942 Guatemala earthquake|1942]], [[1956 Nicaragua earthquake|1956]], [[1982 El Salvador earthquake|1982]], [[1992 Nicaragua earthquake|1992]], [[2001 El Salvador earthquakes|2001]], [[2007 Guatemala earthquake|2007]], [[2012 Guatemala earthquake|2012]], [[October 2014 Nicaragua earthquake|2014]], and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\n\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The [[Motagua Fault]] is an onshore continuation of the [[Cayman Trough]] which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This [[transform fault]] cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near [[Acapulco]]. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|1717]], [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|1773]], [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976]], [[1980 Honduras earthquake|1980]], and [[2009 Honduras earthquake|2009]].\n\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the [[Chixoy-Polochic Fault]], which runs parallel to, and roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.<ref name=White1985 />\n\n[[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931]] and [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972]].\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris.

However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.\n\nIn 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the [[Central American Integration System]] (''Sistema para la Integraci\u00f3n Centroamericana'', or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the [[Dominican Republic]], a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.\n\nOn 6 December 2008, SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081206-central-american-leaders-agree-common-currency-|title=Central American leaders agree on common currency|work=France 24|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}</ref> No timeline for implementation was discussed.\n\nCentral America already has several supranational institutions such as the [[Central American Parliament]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Central American Common Market]].\n\nOn 22 July 2011, President [[Mauricio Funes]] of El Salvador became the first president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to SICA.

The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.\n\nCosta Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Clear left}}\n\n== Economy ==\n{{See also|Economy of Belize|Economy of Costa Rica|Economy of El Salvador|Economy of Guatemala|Economy of Honduras|Economy of Nicaragua|Economy of Panama}}\n[[File:Federal Republic of Central America 1835 4 Real.jpg|thumb|Federal Republic of Central America, 4 Escudos (1835).

In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from [[El Salvador]], 55 per cent from [[Guatemala]], and 65 per cent from [[Honduras]]. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.<ref name=\"insumisos.com\">https://www.insumisos.com/diplo/NODE/663.HTM</ref>\n\nThey are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime. According to Lucrecia Bautista, coordinator of the''maquilas'' sector of the audit firm Coverco,''labour law regulations are regularly violated in maquilas and there is no political will to enforce their application. In the case of infringements, the labour inspectorate shows remarkable leniency. It is a question of not discouraging investors. \"Trade unionists are subject to pressure, and sometimes to kidnapping or murder.

He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.\n\nAn ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.<ref name=Schwartz149>Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.</ref> Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at [[New York University]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nWhen Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called \"[[learned non-use]].\"<ref>Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Alex Pacheco===\nAlex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at [[George Washington University]] when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a [[slaughterhouse]] in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]].<ref  name=Carlson/> Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.<ref name=Pacheco />\n\n===The monkeys===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] -->\nInside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.

Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.<ref name=Carlson>Carlson, Peter. \"The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys,\" ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.</ref> Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.<ref name=Guillermo13/>\n\n==Police raid and charges==\n\n===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===\nPacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=Carlson/> He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with [[cockroach]]es in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:<ref name=Pacheco/>\n\n{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and feces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discolored, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took the fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.<ref name=Pacheco/>}}\n\n===Informal inspections and raid===\nPacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some [[walkie-talkie]]s, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the [[Vancouver]]-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a \"miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates\" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and \"in pretty good health\".<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nPacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: \"It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there.\" Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nThe police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Taub's response===\nTaub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.<ref name=Science11dec1981>Holder, Constance. \"Scientist convicted for monkey neglect,\" ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218\u20131220.</ref> Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nDuring the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court\u2014as reported by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\u2014that the monkeys had been given \"gentle\" treatment, and had what he called a \"remarkable record of health.\" He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.<ref name=Ettlin>Ettlin, David Michael.

He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.<ref name=Ettlin/>\n\n===National Institutes of Health investigation===\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.<ref name=Ettlin/> It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab.

The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge\u2014District Court Judge Stanley Klavan\u2014found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===\nTaub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n==Fight for custody==\nAfter the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.<ref name=Sideris>{{cite journal | author = Sideris Lisa, McCarthy Charles, Smith David H | year = 1999 | title = Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080603111554/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 1 }}</ref> They were later removed to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center in [[Covington, Louisiana]], still under the care and control of the NIH.<ref>''The Washington Post'', January 5, 1989.</ref> Two primate sanctuaries, Moorpark College in California and Primarily Primates in Texas, offered them a permanent home, but the NIH refused to release them.<ref name=Barnard>Barnard ND et al.

He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.\n\nAn ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.<ref name=Schwartz149>Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.</ref> Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at [[New York University]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nWhen Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called \"[[learned non-use]].\"<ref>Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Alex Pacheco===\nAlex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at [[George Washington University]] when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a [[slaughterhouse]] in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]].<ref  name=Carlson/> Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.<ref name=Pacheco />\n\n===The monkeys===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] -->\nInside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.  Each monkey lived alone in a wire cage measuring 18&nbsp; x&nbsp;18&nbsp;inches, with no bedding, no food bowl, and no environmental enrichment, the cages kept in a windowless room measuring 15&nbsp;ft square.<ref name=Guillermo13>Guillermo, Kathy Snow.

Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.<ref name=Carlson>Carlson, Peter. \"The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys,\" ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.</ref> Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.<ref name=Guillermo13/>\n\n==Police raid and charges==\n\n===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===\nPacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=Carlson/> He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with [[cockroach]]es in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:<ref name=Pacheco/>\n\n{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and feces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discolored, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took the fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.<ref name=Pacheco/>}}\n\n===Informal inspections and raid===\nPacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some [[walkie-talkie]]s, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the [[Vancouver]]-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a \"miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates\" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and \"in pretty good health\".<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nPacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: \"It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there.\" Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nThe police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Taub's response===\nTaub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.<ref name=Science11dec1981>Holder, Constance. \"Scientist convicted for monkey neglect,\" ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218\u20131220.</ref> Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nDuring the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court\u2014as reported by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\u2014that the monkeys had been given \"gentle\" treatment, and had what he called a \"remarkable record of health.\" He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.<ref name=Ettlin>Ettlin, David Michael.

He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.<ref name=Ettlin/>\n\n===National Institutes of Health investigation===\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.<ref name=Ettlin/> It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab.

The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge\u2014District Court Judge Stanley Klavan\u2014found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===\nTaub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n==Fight for custody==\nAfter the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.<ref name=Sideris>Sideris, Lisa; McCarthy, Charles; and Smith, David H. 1999 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603111554/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml \"Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics\"], ''ILAR Journal'', volume 40, issue 1.</ref> They were later removed to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center in [[Covington, Louisiana]], still under the care and control of the NIH.<ref>''The Washington Post'', January 5, 1989.</ref> Two primate sanctuaries, Moorpark College in California and Primarily Primates in Texas, offered them a permanent home, but the NIH refused to release them.<ref name=Barnard>Barnard ND et al.

After euthanasia, tissue examination would continue.<ref name=Barnard/> The court allowed a group of researchers from the NIH to conduct a terminal experiment on January 14, 1990 on one of the monkeys who had become ill. Under anesthesia, electrodes were placed in his brain and hundreds of recordings taken. The ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'' said it revealed an \"unprecedented degree of reorganization of the sensory cortex. An 8&ndash;10-millimeter-wide area that would normally receive input from the hand was found to have completely filled in with input from the face.\" Brainmapping studies were conducted on the remaining monkeys on July 6, 1990, three days after PETA's application for custody was rejected.
