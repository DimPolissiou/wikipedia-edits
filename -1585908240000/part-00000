On 21 July 2008 the ''Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008'' came into force. Section 70 changes some of the provisions with regard censorship of films in the State.

Similar to Anarchy and Election Year, The First Purge features intensely depicted violence and some gory imagery but has contextual justification. There are sustained scenes of threat in which the characters are terrorised by masked killers but the guidelines for a 16 classification on the IFCO suggest that strong horror and sustained threat may be acceptable in this category.\n\nThe violence is presented in an extremely stylised way in an equivalent manner to the earlier films in the franchise as well as similar titles like Atomic Blonde (16), John Wick (16) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (16).\n |source = ''Direct correspondence between Universal Pictures and the IFCO''\n |quoted = 1\n}}\n\n:A.{{Note|firsttwo}} ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]'' and ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' both received 16 certificates, for \"''frequent strong bloody violence, disturbing sequences, strong threat of sexual violence''\"<ref>[http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/22C5B19D8795AF0180257D0A004CFC3F?OpenDocument&OpenUp=True]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref> and \"''strong bloody violence throughout''\"<ref>[http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/0CF88647F7AE23F680257FE700504C41?OpenDocument&OpenUp=True]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref> respectively.

As can sometimes be the case with long-running horror franchises, in evolution they become more violent and explicit to maintain the interest of their audience. This is, in my opinion, the case with 'The Purge' series of films. The first instalment, essentially a 'home invasion' thriller, was classified 15A. The next two ('The Purge: Anarchy' and 'The Purge': Election Year) broadened out the story and intensified in terms of body count and the graphic way in which some of the violence was depicted. Both were classified 16 on cinema release. 'The Purge: Election Year' was classified 18 on DVD release. In most cases films classified 16 theatrically are classified 15 on DVD release. This classification is more restrictive than 15A. In rarer cases the DVD classification is increased to 18 to reflect the level of content.\n\nThe First Purge intensifies the extremely graphic violence   - the violence here is brutal and sustained.

Such films may not be shown in public cinemas or sold in shops, but are not ''ipso facto'' banned and have been shown at film festivals and [[art film|art house]] clubs such as the [[Irish Film Theatre]] and [[Irish Film Institute]]. These may also show films which have not been submitted for certification, as the submission fee may be prohibitive if a film is screened only a few times at a small venue.\n\nProhibitions and revocations, with justification, are listed in the official gazette, [[Iris Oifigi\u00fail]], under the headings of '''PROHIBITION ORDER''' and '''REVOCATION ORDER'''.\n\nDespite the recommendations in the 2000 review of certification that no further films be banned, bans are still occasionally issued, although usually overturned on appeal. ''[[Boy Eats Girl]]'', a 2005 movie, was initially banned, with the option of a cut being provided to the producers. On appeal, the film was passed uncut, and granted a 15A rating,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/boy-will-get-to-eat-girl-after-all-1.476854|title=Boy will get to eat girl after all|first=Donald|last=Clarke|website=The Irish Times}}</ref> although the video certificate was raised to 18.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifco.ie/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/lookupreports2/D2E379DFC484D98E802571AB0039E72B/$File/2005%20Annual%20Report.pdf?openelement |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114121206/http://ifco.ie/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/lookupreports2/D2E379DFC484D98E802571AB0039E72B/$File/2005%20Annual%20Report.pdf?openelement |archive-date=14 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMovies which are never submitted for cinema release in Ireland are occasionally banned on attempted video releases, although only one such order was made in 2004, banning the pornographic ''Anabolic Initiations 5'', with the appeals board upholding the censor's order.

The board has been described as too zealous and conservative. Many titles that receive 15 certificates from the BBFC are rated 18 by the IFCO. DVD examples include ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/1D0A22A500736BA7|title=Kick-Ass (2010)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> and ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/2819C5B30078DC14|title=Black Swan (2011)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> Rarer cinema examples (which bypass the 16 rating) include ''[[Free Fire]]''<ref name=\"auto\"/> and ''[[You Were Never Really Here]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/3922AF0E0050DC8D|title=You Were Never Really Here (2018)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the IFCO are more lenient with strong language than the BBFC are, especially with very strong language (e.g. 'cunt'). Examples include ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' and ''[[The Visitor (2007 drama film)|The Visitor]]'' receiving 15 certificates in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/frostnixon-2008|title=FROST/NIXON &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/visitor-2007|title=THE VISITOR &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> but PG's in Ireland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/5AC1C25E00569F45|title=Frost/Nixon (2009)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/D3A2B1CE00441548|title=Visitor, The (2008)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> despite the use of the stronger term '[[motherfucker]]', and ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' receiving an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]] in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/gone-girl-film|title=GONE GIRL &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> but a 15 (on video) in Ireland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/36D416210078DB60|title=Gone Girl (2014)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> despite four aggressive uses of 'cunt'. The 2014 documentary ''[[Red Army (film)|Red Army]]'' received a 15 in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/red-army-2014|title=RED ARMY &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> but a 12A in Ireland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/855BF77500403E42|title=Red Army (2015)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> for a single use of 'cocksucker' (although the video rating was upgraded to 15).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/9DECB130007369A9|title=Red Army (2015)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref>\n\nThree titles in particular drew criticism of the board: ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'', ''[[But I'm a Cheerleader]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. All three were rated 18 in Ireland and 15 in the UK, although ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' was rated 16 for cinema release because the system is different than for video releases (it was only an 18 on video).\n\nThe IFCO is established on a statutory basis and thus the appeals procedure is final. Thus, when a film or video game is banned, there can be no further appeal, but the work may be resubmitted after seven years.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[British Board of Film Classification]] - the equivalent body to the IFCO in the United Kingdom\n* [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland]]\n* [[Film censorship in the Republic of Ireland]]\n* [[Television content rating systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/confessions-of-an-irish-censor-why-clark-gable-casablanca-and-cliff-got-the-chop-792076.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Confessions of an Irish censor: why Clark Gable, 'Casablanca' and Cliff got the chop |first=David |last=McKittrick |date=6 March 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}\n* {{cite book |first=Kevin |last=Rockett | authorlink = Kevin Rockett|title=Irish film censorship: a cultural journey from silent cinema to internet pornography |location=Dublin |publisher=Four Courts Press |year=2004 |ISBN= 1-85182-844-3}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.ifco.ie|Irish Film Classification Office}} \u2013 official site\n* [https://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/censor/ Irish Film Censors' Records] - searchable calendar at [[Trinity College Dublin]], mostly from period 1923-38\n\n{{Pornography legality|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Motion picture rating systems]]\n[[Category:Media in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Entertainment rating organizations]]\n[[Category:Censorship in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Department of Justice and Equality]]\n[[Category:Government agencies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Use Irish English|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox organization\n|name         = Irish Film Classification Office<br>Oifig Aicmithe Scann\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann\n|image        = IFCO logo.svg\n|formation    = {{Start date and age|1923|df=yes}}\n|purpose      = [[Motion picture rating system|Film ratings]]\n|headquarters = [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|leader_title = Director of film classification\n|leader_name  = Ger Connolly\n|website      = {{URL|www.ifco.ie}}\n}}\nThe '''Irish Film Classification Office''' ('''IFCO''') ({{lang-ga|Oifig Aicmithe Scann\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann, OAS\u00c9}}) is the organisation responsible for films, television programmes, and some video game classification and censorship within [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Where restrictions are placed by the IFCO, they are legally binding.\n\nPrior to 21 July 2008, the office was branded as the ''Irish Film Censor's Office'', and was previously known as simply the ''Film Censor's Office'', or, in legal references, the office of the ''Official Censor of Films'', which was the official title of the head of the office prior to that date. The head of the office is the '''Director of Film Classification'''.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:IFCO 1962cover.jpg|thumb|1965 [[Cover (philately)|envelope]] sent to local office of [[20th Century Fox]] with '''certifying cachet''' of the Film Censor's Office]]\nThe Irish Film Censor's Office was set up in 1923, in accordance with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051205061510/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1923_23.html Censorship of Films Act, 1923]. This law was amended in [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1925/en/act/pub/0021/index.html 1925], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0013/index.html 1930], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0007/index.html 1970], and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0029/index.html 1992]; and a substantial revision of the law occurred in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051206051939/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989_22.html Video Recordings Act, 1989] which extended the remit of the office to the regulation of the video importation and supply industry. On 21 July 2008 the ''Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008'' came into force. Section 70 changes some of the provisions with regard censorship of films in the State. Section 71 renames the Film Censor as the Director of Film Classification and consequent to this, the Irish Film Censor's Office became the Irish Film Classification Office.\n\n==Staff==\nThe office consists of 21 staff members:\n*Acting Director of Film Classification \u2013 Ger Connolly\n*Deputy Director \u2013 Vacant\n*10 Assistant Classifiers\n*Office Manager\n*6 [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|Civil Servants]] from the [[Department of Justice and Equality]]\n*2 Projectionists\n\nThe 10 assistant classifiers are paid \u20ac168 per day and are entitled to claim expenses on top of this.

There are sustained scenes of threat in which the characters are terrorised by masked killers but the guidelines for a 16 classification on the IFCO suggest that strong horror and sustained threat may be acceptable in this category.\n\nThe violence is presented in an extremely stylised way in an equivalent manner to the earlier films in the franchise as well as similar titles like Atomic Blonde (16), John Wick (16) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (16).\n |source = ''Direct correspondence between Universal Pictures and the IFCO''\n |quoted = 1\n}}\n\n:A.{{Note|firsttwo}} ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]'' and ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' both received 16 certificates, for \"''frequent strong bloody violence, disturbing sequences, strong threat of sexual violence''\"<ref>[http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/22C5B19D8795AF0180257D0A004CFC3F?OpenDocument&OpenUp=True]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref> and \"''strong bloody violence throughout''\"<ref>[http://www.ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewFilm/0CF88647F7AE23F680257FE700504C41?OpenDocument&OpenUp=True]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref> respectively.

As can sometimes be the case with long-running horror franchises, in evolution they become more violent and explicit to maintain the interest of their audience. This is, in my opinion, the case with 'The Purge' series of films. The first instalment, essentially a 'home invasion' thriller, was classified 15A. The next two ('The Purge: Anarchy' and 'The Purge': Election Year) broadened out the story and intensified in terms of body count and the graphic way in which some of the violence was depicted. Both were classified 16 on cinema release. 'The Purge: Election Year' was classified 18 on DVD release. In most cases films classified 16 theatrically are classified 15 on DVD release. This classification is more restrictive than 15A. In rarer cases the DVD classification is increased to 18 to reflect the level of content.\n\nThe First Purge intensifies the extremely graphic violence   - the violence here is brutal and sustained. It also contained a scene of sexual assault as well as scenes of very overt brutal racist violence against African Americans with the attackers in full Ku Klux Klan regalia. These were not present in the other instalments.\n\nI suggest that the context here is not sufficient to warrant a 16 classification due to the extremely brutal and frenzied acts of violence combined with racial hatred and that \u2018The First Purge\u2019 is appropriately classified at 18.\n |source = ''Ger Connolly, in direct correspondence with Universal Pictures''\n |quoted = 1\n}}\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/the-purge-appeal-classification-ireland-4231610-Sep2018/|title=Appeal after 'brutal and frenzied violence' leads to film getting 18 rating|first=Aoife|last=Barry|website=TheJournal.ie}}</ref>\n\n===Previous appeals (excluding bans)===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Original certificate\n!Content guidance/Details\n!Appeal results\n!Revised certificate\n!Current certificate\n|-\n| 1989 || ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]'' || 15 || ''\"Very, very violent\"'' and ''\"an evil influence for young audiences\"'' according to head censor Sheamus Smith.\n\nA spokesperson for [[Columbia TriStar Television|Columbia TriStar]] said, ''\"The first two [[The Karate Kid (franchise)|Karate Kid]] films had 'under 12' certificates here and the new one has similar certificates in Britain and America.

DVD examples include ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/1D0A22A500736BA7|title=Kick-Ass (2010)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> and ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/2819C5B30078DC14|title=Black Swan (2011)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> Rarer cinema examples (which bypass the 16 rating) include ''[[Free Fire]]''<ref name=\"auto\"/> and ''[[You Were Never Really Here]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/3922AF0E0050DC8D|title=You Were Never Really Here (2018)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the IFCO are more lenient with strong language than the BBFC are, especially with very strong language (e.g. 'cunt'). Examples include ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' and ''[[The Visitor (2007 drama film)|The Visitor]]'' receiving 15 certificates in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/frostnixon-2008|title=FROST/NIXON &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/visitor-2007|title=THE VISITOR &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> but PG's in Ireland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/5AC1C25E00569F45|title=Frost/Nixon (2009)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/D3A2B1CE00441548|title=Visitor, The (2008)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> despite the use of the stronger term '[[motherfucker]]', and ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' receiving an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]] in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/gone-girl-film|title=GONE GIRL &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> but a 15 (on video) in Ireland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/36D416210078DB60|title=Gone Girl (2014)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> despite four aggressive uses of 'cunt'. The 2014 documentary ''[[Red Army (film)|Red Army]]'' received a 15 in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/red-army-2014|title=RED ARMY &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> but a 12A in Ireland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/855BF77500403E42|title=Red Army (2015)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref> for a single use of 'cocksucker' (although the video rating was upgraded to 15).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ifco.ie/en/ifco/pages/9DECB130007369A9|title=Red Army (2015)|first=Irish Film Classification|last=Office|website=Irish Film Classification Office}}</ref>\n\nThree titles in particular drew criticism of the board: ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'', ''[[But I'm a Cheerleader]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. All three were rated 18 in Ireland and 15 in the UK, although ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' was rated 16 for cinema release because the system is different than for video releases (it was only an 18 on video).\n\nThe IFCO is established on a statutory basis and thus the appeals procedure is final. Thus, when a film or video game is banned, there can be no further appeal, but the work may be resubmitted after seven years.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[British Board of Film Classification]] - the equivalent body to the IFCO in the United Kingdom\n* [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland]]\n* [[Film censorship in the Republic of Ireland]]\n* [[Television content rating systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/confessions-of-an-irish-censor-why-clark-gable-casablanca-and-cliff-got-the-chop-792076.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Confessions of an Irish censor: why Clark Gable, 'Casablanca' and Cliff got the chop |first=David |last=McKittrick |date=6 March 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}\n* {{cite book |first=Kevin |last=Rockett | authorlink = Kevin Rockett|title=Irish film censorship: a cultural journey from silent cinema to internet pornography |location=Dublin |publisher=Four Courts Press |year=2004 |ISBN= 1-85182-844-3}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.ifco.ie|Irish Film Classification Office}} \u2013 official site\n* [https://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/censor/ Irish Film Censors' Records] - searchable calendar at [[Trinity College Dublin]], mostly from period 1923-38\n\n{{Pornography legality|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Motion picture rating systems]]\n[[Category:Media in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Entertainment rating organizations]]\n[[Category:Censorship in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Department of Justice and Equality]]\n[[Category:Government agencies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Film_Classification_Office"}
