While Sunnis regard '''[[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]''' in high esteem and respect his place as one of the \"[[Four Righteously Guided Caliphs]]\", the [[Shia]] do not view him as a legitimate leader of the [[Ummah]] and believe that [[Umar]] and [[Abu Bakr]] conspired to usurp power from [[Ali]]. Shia believe that the Sunni view of Umar was created by the later [[Umayyad]] dynasty to honour the man that gave power to the first [[Umayyad]] ruler and third Sunni [[Caliph]], [[Uthman]]. In this way, it gives legitimacy to Umar's consultation that started their own dynasty. Shia believe that the Umayyad view was propagated with lethal force and heavy duress and as time went on, that view became predominant and eventually taken as truth, cemented by the works of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]. However, most historians and academics are in agreement that the Shia view of Umar has been heavily distorted and exaggerated, due to the heavy Persian and Jewish influences within the Shia religon.\n\n==Shi'a Biography==\n\n===Embracing Islam===\nA Sh'ia scholar states:{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|Some historians claim that Umar was a most awe-inspiring man, and when he accepted Islam, the idolaters were gripped with fear for their lives. But this is only a case of a dominant myth being in conflict with ugly facts. When Umar accepted Islam, the idolaters remained where they were, and nothing changed for them; but it was Muhammad who was compelled to leave his home, and had to find sanctuary in a desolate ravine. He spent three years in that ravine, and during those years of exile, his life was exposed to deadly perils every day and every night. During this entire period of more than 1000 days, Umar, like many other Muslims in Makkah, was the silent spectator of the ordeals of his master.

When he died, Umar sought to find a husband for her. He approached his friend [[Uthman]] who said \"I am of the opinion that I shall not marry at present\", after thinking about the proposal for a few days. Umar became angry with Uthman and asked Abu Bakr the same thing. Abu Bakr did not give him a reply, causing Umar to become even more angry with him than he was with Uthman. Umar then preceded to Muhammad to discuss the previous two incidents. Muhammad reassured Umar by saying that \"Hafsa will marry one better than Uthman will marry one better than Abu Bakr.\" Umar was obviously alluding to the fact that Hafsa was to marry Muhammad and that Uthman was to marry a daughter of Muhammad.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.342 Bukhari 005.059.342] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215235005/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.342 |date=December 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHafsa was married to Muhammad in 625.

The Muslims who fought against and killed each other in these civil wars, did not belong to the distant future; they belonged to the generation of the Prophet himself.\n\nCivil wars broke out in Islam at a time when its idealism was supposed to be still fresh. But the elective system devised by Umar had built-in confrontation, and it took Islam across a great divide.

Instead of one candidate for caliphate, he made six candidates. If his decision to appoint his successor had been as direct and forthright as that of Abu Bakr had been, Islam might have been spared the traumatic and horrendous experience of civil wars so early in its career. The Muslims who fought against and killed each other in these civil wars, did not belong to the distant future; they belonged to the generation of the Prophet himself.\n\nCivil wars broke out in Islam at a time when its idealism was supposed to be still fresh. But the elective system devised by Umar had built-in confrontation, and it took Islam across a great divide. His policy proved to be counter-productive, and his mode of giving the Muslims a leader through his panel of electors turned out to be one of the greatest misfortunes of the history of Islam.<ref name=restatement/>}}\n\n==Views on the Shi'a view==\n\n===Non-Muslim view===\n[[Edward Gibbon]] wrote:\n{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually confined to the times and countries in which they have been agitated.
