He was the eighth son of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] and the fourth son of Emperor Gaozong's second wife [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]]. He was wholly a figurehead during his first reign when he was controlled by his mother, and during his second reign after his mother's death, significant power was exercised by his sister [[Princess Taiping]]. \n\nIn February 684, Li Dan's mother Empress Wu demoted his older brother [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] (Li Xian) who had attempted to rule free of his mother and named him emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).  Emperor Ruizong, however, was a puppet under control of his mother and did not have any real power. From then onwards, the Tang Dynasty existed only in name and Empress Dowager Wu ruled China for over six years as acting emperor, and then, In October 690 Emperor Ruizong ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant \u2013 the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. She also issued a decree that ended the [[Tang dynasty]] and founded the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]].{{NoteTag|Decades earlier, in 653, a minor female agrarian rebel leader, [[Chen Shuozhen]] (\u9673\u78a9\u771f), had claimed the title of \"Empress Regnant Wenjia\" (\u6587\u4f73\u7687\u5e1d), during her rebellion.  However, because her rebellion was very limited in scope and was quickly crushed, she is not typically regarded as a true \"empress regnant.\"  See ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]].  Earlier than that, during [[Northern Wei Dynasty]], [[Empress Dowager Hu (Northern Wei)|Empress Dowager Hu]], after her son [[Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming]]'s death, falsely declared [[Daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming's daughter]] to be a son and declared the daughter to be the new emperor, but almost immediately revealed that the child was in fact female, and thereafter declared [[Yuan Zhao]], the young son of Emperor Xiaoming's cousin Yuan Baohui (\u5143\u5bf6\u6689) emperor. See ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377152|vol. 152]]. Emperor Xiaoming's daughter is also therefore not usually considered a true emperor.}}  Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of [[crown prince]], with the unconventional title of ''Huangsi'' (\u7687\u55e3, \"imperial successor\").  In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews [[Wu Chengsi]] and [[Wu Sansi]] tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Di Renjie]] and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital [[Luoyang]].  Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to his elder brother, and Li Xian became crown prince instead.\n\nIn 705, a [[coup]] overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong to the throne.  The five years of Emperor Zhongzong's reign were dominated by Zhongzong's empress consort, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]].  In the beginning of July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei who then named Zhongzong's youngest son [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang). A mere two weeks later, Li Dan's sister [[Princess Taiping]] and Li Dan's son [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] the Prince of Linzi launched a coup which resulted in the death of Empress Wei.  Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother [[Li Chengqi]] the Prince of Song then persuaded Li Dan to take the throne himself, and he agreed, returning to the throne in Emperor Shang's stead.  Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments.\n\nSoon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had lots of power and supporters, and Li Longji mounted.  Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]]).  However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power.  However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide.  After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene.  He died in 716.\n\n==Background==\nLi Xulun was born in 662, as the youngest son of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] and his second wife [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] (later known as Wu Zetian).  Later that year, he was created the Prince of Yin.  In 664, he was nominally made the commandant at Ji Prefecture (\u5180\u5dde, roughly modern [[Hengshui]], [[Hebei]]) and the Chanyu Protectorate General (headquarters in modern [[Hohhot]], [[Inner Mongolia]]).  It was said that, as he grew, he became known for humility, the love for his siblings, and talent in [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]].  In 666, his title was changed to Prince of Yu.  In 669, his title was changed to Prince of Ji, and his name was changed from Xulun to Lun.  In 675, his title was changed to Prince of Xiang.  In 678, his title was changed back to Prince of Yu, and his name was further changed to Li Dan.  He was also made the prefect of Luo Prefecture (\u6d1b\u5dde), the prefecture containing the eastern capital [[Luoyang]].  Sometime between 676 and 679, he married his wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Princess Liu]].\n\nEmperor Gaozong died in 683 and was succeeded by Li Dan's older brother [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Zhe]] the [[Crown Prince]] (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Empress Wu retained power as [[empress dowager]] and [[regent]].  In 684, when Emperor Zhongzong displayed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with Li Dan (as Emperor Ruizong), but wielded power even more firmly.  Indeed, she housed Emperor Ruizong in a different palace and did not let him meet the imperial officials or give input on affairs of state.  Emperor Ruizong's wife Princess Liu was created [[empress]], while her son [[Li Chengqi]] was created crown prince.\n\n==First reign under Empress Dowager Wu's regency==\nSoon after Emperor Ruizong took the throne, Empress Dowager Wu carried out a major renaming of governmental offices and banners.  She, who disliked the capital [[Chang'an]], also elevated Luoyang's status, making it a co-equal capital with Chang'an.  She further, at the suggestion of her nephew [[Wu Chengsi]], built an ancestral temple for five generations of her ancestors and had Emperor Ruizong posthumously create them princes.\n\nIn fall 684, [[Li Jingye]] the Duke of Ying (the grandson of the deceased general [[Li Shiji|Li Ji]]), started a rebellion against Empress Dowager Wu at Yang Prefecture, seeking the restoration of Emperor Zhongzong.  Empress Dowager Wu, in response, sent the general Li Xiaoyi (\u674e\u5b5d\u9038), assisted by the generals Li Zhishi (\u674e\u77e5\u5341) and Ma Jingchen (\u99ac\u656c\u81e3) to suppress Li Jianye's rebellion, and Li Xiaoyi quickly did so.  Meanwhile, believing the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Pei Yan]] to be undermining her authority, she executed Pei under accusation of treason and demoted a large number of officials and generals who dared to speak in Pei's defense, later executing some of them.\n\nIn 686, Empress Dowager created a number of bronze boxes designed to encourage secret reports of crimes.  She also began to retain a group of secret police officials to carry out torture and interrogation of people suspected of opposing her rule, including [[Suo Yuanli]], [[Zhou Xing (Tang Dynasty)|Zhou Xing]], and [[Lai Junchen]].  On one occasion, she offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong knew that she was not actually intending to do so, and therefore declined.  She thereafter resumed exercising imperial powers.\n\nEmperor Ruizong had largely stayed out of political matters during these years, but he made an exception in 687 when Empress Dowager Wu believed the chancellor [[Liu Yizhi]], who had previously served on his staff when he was a prince, whom she had trusted and promoted, to have turned against her in favoring that she return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong.  She had Liu accused of corruption and arrested, and Emperor Ruizong personally wrote a petition to request her to spare Liu\u2014which, however, as Liu observed, had the opposite effect, and she ordered Liu to commit suicide.\n\nIn 688, fearing that Empress Dowager Wu was using a ceremony to worship the god of the Luo River (\u6d1b\u6c34, flowing near Luoyang) as an excuse to summon them to Luoyang to slaughter them, the imperial princes considered rebellion, and one was launched by Emperor Ruizong's uncle [[Li Zhen (Tang Dynasty)|Li Zhen]] the Prince of Yue and Li Zhen's son [[Li Chong (Tang Dynasty)|Li Chong]] the Prince of Langye, claiming that Emperor Ruizong was under arrest and needed to be rescued.  However, both Li Zhen and Li Chong were quickly defeated; Li Chong was killed in battle, while Li Zhen committed suicide.  Empress Dowager Wu used this opportunity to carry out a major purge of senior imperial Li clan members, including Emperor Ruizong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (\u674e\u5143\u5609) the Prince of Han and Li Lingkui (\u674e\u9748\u5914) the Prince of Lu.\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu received a number of petitions that she take the throne herself, and Emperor Ruizong also submitted such a petition.  She accepted, and she took the throne as \"empress regnant,\" establishing a new [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou Dynasty]] and interrupting Tang Dynasty.  She demoted Emperor Ruizong to the position of crown prince (with the unusual title ''Huangsi'' (\u7687\u55e3)), and changed his name back to Lun.  She further had him take her family name of Wu.\n\n==During Wu Zetian's reign==\nDespite the fact that Wu Zetian created Li Dan crown prince, she considered creating one of her nephews, Wu Chengsi the Prince of Wei or [[Wu Sansi]] the Prince of Liang crown prince, and a petition drive for Wu Chengsi to be created crown prince reached its peak in 691.  The chancellors [[Cen Changqian]] and [[Ge Fuyuan]] were even executed for opposing it, but Wu Zetian never did carry out the change, and when the leader of the petition drive, Wang Qingzhi (\u738b\u6176\u4e4b) was caned to death by the official [[Li Zhaode]], the petition drive dissipated.\n\nMeanwhile, in 693, Wu Zetian's [[lady in waiting]] Wei Tuan'er (\u97cb\u5718\u5152), who was resentful of Li Dan for reasons lost to history, falsely accused Li Dan's wife Crown Princess Liu and [[concubine]] Consort Dou of witchcraft, and Wu Zetian killed Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou.  In fear of offending Wu Zetian, Li Dan did not dare to mourn either and continued to behave normally.  When Wei Tuan'er tried to further falsely accuse Li Dan, someone, in turn, reported her activities to Wu Zetian, and Wu Zetian executed her.  Still, thereafter, Li Dan's sons were demoted in rank and kept under secure watch.  Later in 693, the officials Pei Feigong (\u88f4\u532a\u8eac) and Fan Yunxian (\u8303\u96f2\u4ed9) were executed on account of meeting Li Dan secretly, and there were accusations that Li Dan was planning to rebel against Wu Zetian.  Wu Zetian ordered that the officials not be allowed to meet Li Dan, and further arrested his servants to interrogate them.  The secret police official [[Lai Junchen]] tortured Li Dan's servants, and many of them, unable to stand up to the torture, considered falsely implicating Li Dan.  One of them, [[An Jinzang]], however, cut his own belly open and proclaimed Li Dan's innocence.  When Wu Zetian heard this, she sent imperial doctors to save An, and, impressed by An's willingness to die to show Li Dan's innocence, ended the investigation against Li Dan.\n\nIn 698, after Wu Zetian had, at the encouragement of the chancellors [[Di Renjie]], [[Wang Fangqing]], and [[Wang Jishan]], as well as her close associate [[Ji Xu]] and lovers [[Zhang Yizhi]] and [[Zhang Changzong]], recalled Li Zhe from exile, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe.  Wu Zetian agreed and created Li Zhe crown prince (changing his name initially back to Li Xian and then Wu Xian) and Li Dan the Prince of Xiang.\n\nIn 699, Wu Zetian, in fear that after her death that Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not be able to coexist peacefully, had Li Xian, Li Dan, their sister [[Princess Taiping]], her husband [[Wu Youji]] (Wu Zetian's nephew), and the other Wu clan princes swear an oath to each other and read the oaths to the gods.  The oaths were then carved on iron and kept in the imperial archives.  Later that year, the restrictions on his and Li Xian's sons were lifted, and they were allowed to live outside the palace.\n\nIn 701, when there was an incursion by the [[Eastern Tujue]] khan [[Ashina Mochuo]], Li Dan was put in command of an army to defend against the attack, but before the army could be launched, Ashina Mochuo withdrew.  Subsequently, Li Dan was nominally put in charge of the imperial guards.\n\nIn 702, Wu Zetian put Li Dan in command of an army and made the prefect of Bing Prefecture (\u5e76\u5dde, roughly modern [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]), with Wu Sansi, [[Wu Youning]], and [[Wei Yuanzhong]] as his assistants, apparently preparing to attack Eastern Tujue, but the army was never launched.  Later that year, she had Li Xian, Li Dan, and Princess Taiping submit formal petitions to have Zhang Changzong created a prince.  She then formally rejected the petitions, but created Zhang Changzong and Zhang Yizhi dukes.\n\nIn 703, Li Dan was made the prefect of Yong Prefecture (\u96cd\u5dde, roughly modern [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]), the prefecture that included Chang'an.\n\n==During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign under Empress Wie's shadow==\nIn 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup led by [[Zhang Jianzhi]], [[Cui Xuanwei]], [[Huan Yanfan]], [[Jing Hui]], and [[Yuan Shuji]].  (Yuan was Li Dan's secretary general, and during the coup, Yuan's responsibility was to safeguard Li Dan, suggesting, but not proving, that Li Dan might have known about the coup plans.)  Li Xian was restored to the throne, and he gave Li Dan the special title of ''Anguo Xiangwang'' (\u5b89\u570b\u76f8\u738b), literally \"the Prince of Xiang who pacified the state.\"  Emperor Zhongzong also gave Li Dan the title of ''Taiwei'' (\u592a\u5c09, one of the [[Three Excellencies]]) and made him a chancellor with the designation of ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin'' (\u540c\u4e2d\u66f8\u9580\u4e0b\u4e09\u54c1).  Li Dan declined both honors, and Emperor Zhongzong then offered to create him heir apparent, which Li Dan declined as well.  Emperor Zhongzong subsequently created his son [[Li Chongjun]] crown prince.\n\nIn 707, Li Chongjun, who was not born of Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] (her only son [[Li Chongrun]] having been killed by Wu Zetian), was angry that Empress Wei's daughter Li Guo'er the [[Princess Anle]] and her husband Wu Chongxun (\u6b66\u5d07\u8a13, Wu Sansi's son) repeatedly insulted him and were trying to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to create Li Guo'er crown princess to displace Li Chongjun, rose in rebellion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun.  His subsequent attack on the palace, however, was repelled, and he was killed in flight.  Some of his followers implicated Li Dan and Princess Taiping after they were arrested and interrogated.  Emperor Zhongzong initially had the imperial censor [[Xiao Zhizhong]] put in charge of investigating Li Dan and Princess Taiping, but at Xiao's earnest urging stopped the investigation.\n\nIn 708, when Li Guo'er married again, to Wu Yanxiu (\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0), Li Dan was the ceremonial protector of her litter.\n\n==During Emperor Shang's reign under Empress dowager Wei's regency==\nOn 3 July 710,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A4%A4%A9v&reign=%B4%BA%C0s&yy=4&ycanzi=&mm=&dd=&dcanzi= \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly\u2014a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, so that Empress Wei could be Empress Regnant like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess.  Under a will drafted for Emperor Zhongzong by Princess Taiping and Emperor Zhongzong's concubine [[Shangguan Wan'er|Consort Shangguan Wan'er]], Emperor Zhongzong's son by another concubine, [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] would be named emperor, with Empress Wei serving as empress dowager and regent, but with Li Dan as co-regent.  This plan, however, was opposed by and ultimately altered at the suggestions of Empress Wei's cousin [[Wei Wen]] and [[Zong Chuke]].  After Li Chongmao took the throne (as Emperor Shang), Empress Wei became empress dowager and regent, while Li Dan only received an entirely ceremonial title of senior advisor to the crown prince (\u592a\u5b50\u592a\u5e2b, ''Taizi Taishi'') \u2013 as there was no crown prince at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Empress Dowager Wei's party viewed Li Dan and Princess Taiping as threats and considered eliminating them.  One of her partisans, [[Cui Riyong]], was fearful of what would happen if the plan failed, and therefore informed the plan to Li Dan's son (by Consort Dou) [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] the Prince of Linzi.  Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian (\u859b\u5d07\u7c21), as well as several low level officials close to him \u2013 [[Zhong Shaojing]], Wang Chongye (\u738b\u5d07\u66c4), [[Liu Youqiu]], and Ma Sizong (\u9ebb\u55e3\u5b97) \u2013 to act first.  Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (\u97cb\u64ad) and Gao Song (\u9ad8\u5d69), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (\u845b\u798f\u9806), Chen Xuanli (\u9673\u7384\u79ae), and Li Xianfu (\u674e\u4ed9\u9ce7) thereafter also joined the plot.\n\nWithout first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on 21 July, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Gui (\u97cb\u74bf).  They then attacked the palace.  When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her.  Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and the powerful lady in waiting Lady Helou were killed as well.  Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street.  Li Dan took over as regent, but at the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Emperor Shang and again became emperor.  Emperor Shang was reduced in rank back to Prince of Wen.\n\n==Second reign under Princess Taiping shadow==\n\nEmperor Ruizong was immediately faced with the issue of whom to make crown prince\u2014as Li Chengqi, as the oldest son overall and the oldest son of his wife, was the appropriate heir under [[Confucian]] principles of succession, but Li Longji had been the one whose accomplishments had allowed him to retake the throne.  He hesitated.  Li Chengqi declined consideration to be crown prince\u2014stating to his father:\n\n{{quote|If the state were secure, then consideration should be first given to the oldest son of the wife.  If the state were in danger, then consideration should be first given for achievement.  If you did not follow this principle, the people of the entire empire will be disappointed.  I would rather die than to be placed above the Prince of Ping [(i.e., Li Longji, whose title had been changed to Prince of Ping by this point)].}}\n\nLi Chengqi wept and begged to yield for several days, and after further persuasion by the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Liu Youqiu]] \u2013 who had been part of Li Longji's coup plans\u2014Emperor Ruizong agreed, and created Li Longji crown prince.  Li Longji submitted a petition offering to yield to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong rejected it.\n\nEmperor Ruizong reversed many of Emperor Zhongzong's actions and posthumously honored many people who lost their lives during the reigns of Wu Zetian and Emperor Zhongzong.  He further removed thousands of officials that Emperor Zhongzong had commissioned at the recommendations of powerful courtiers, without having been submitted for examination by the examination (\u9580\u4e0b\u7701, ''Menxia Sheng'') and legislative (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, ''Zhongshu Sheng'') bureaus of government, as was proper.  Meanwhile, though, with Emperor Ruizong considered meek, the court was dominated by two competing factions\u2014of Princess Taiping and Li Longji.  Indeed, it was said that whenever chancellors brought proposals to Emperor Ruizong, Emperor Ruizong would ask them whether they had consulted Princess Taiping and Li Longji, and only act if the chancellors had consulted them.  Princess Taiping, finding Li Longji to be not receptive to her influences, began to spread news of offenses by Li Longji, hoping that he would eventually be removed.  In 711, the chancellors [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]] and [[Song Jing]] tried to defuse the situation by having Princess Taiping sent to Pu Prefecture (\u84b2\u5dde, roughly modern [[Yuncheng]], [[Shanxi]]) and the two princes with arguable better claims on the throne than Li Longji\u2014Li Chengqi and [[Li Shouli]] the Prince of Bin (whose father [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]] (note different tone than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong) \u2013 out of the capital to serve as prefectural prefects, but after their plan was discovered by Princess Taiping, she angrily complained, and was recalled to the capital along with Li Chengqi and Li Shouli.  Yao and Song, credited with reforming the civil service system, were demoted, and it was said that thereafter, the civil service system became as confused as it was during Emperor Zhongzong's reign.\n\nIn 712, the general Sun Quan (\u5b6b\u4f7a), the commandant at You Prefecture (\u5e7d\u5dde, roughly modern [[Beijing]]), aggressively attacked the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] chieftain Li Dabu (\u674e\u5927\u917a), and was defeated by Li Dabu, at the loss of nearly the entire army.\n\nLater in 712, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, ''Dizuo'' (\u5e1d\u5ea7), showed that there would be a change in the emperor's position\u2014believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way.  Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor's position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji.  Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong's insistence finally accepted and took the throne (as Emperor Xuanzong).  However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong's.\n\n==As retired emperor under princess Taiping shadow==\n[[File:\u5510\u777f\u5b97\u674e\u65e6\u6865\u9675.JPG|thumb|Qiaoling (\u6a4b\u9675), the tomb of Emperor Ruizong, in [[Pucheng County, Shaanxi]]]]\nMeanwhile, Princess Taiping continued to be highly influential in governmental matters management through Emperor Ruizong, and most Government officials and chancellors were her associates.  (Of the seven chancellors at the time, five \u2013 [[Dou Huaizhen]], Xiao Zhizhong, [[Cen Xi]], [[Cui Shi]], and [[Lu Xiangxian]] \u2013 were made chancellors at her recommendation, although Lu was not considered a member of her party.)  Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (\u5f35\u6690), with Emperor Xuanzong's approval, planned to mobilize the imperial guards to kill several of those chancellors\u2014Dou, Cui, and Cen  However, after Zhang told the plan to the imperial censor Deng Guangbin (\u9127\u5149\u8cd3), the news was leaked.  Liu was arrested, and initially set to be executed.  Emperor Xuanzong interceded on his behalf with Emperor Ruizong, and Liu, Zhang, and Deng were spared but exiled.\n\nLater in 712, Emperor Ruizong decreed that Emperor Xuanzong lead a group of soldiers to examine the northern border.  However, the group of conscripted soldiers was disbanded in spring 713, and the plan was never carried out.\n\nBy summer 713, it was said that Princesses Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, Cui; along with other officials [[Xue Ji]], Li Jin (\u674e\u6649) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (\u674e\u5fb7\u826f), a cousin of Tang's founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]]), Li You (\u674e\u7337), Jia Yingfu (\u8cc8\u81ba\u798f), Tang Jun (\u5510\u6659); the generals Chang Yuankai (\u5e38\u5143\u6977), Li Ci (\u674e\u6148), and Li Qin (\u674e\u6b3d); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong.  It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the ''[[gastrodia elata]]'' that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac.  When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (\u738b\u741a), Zhang Shuo, and Cui Riyong to act first, did so.  He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Fan (\u674e\u7bc4) the Prince of Qi, Li Ye (\u674e\u696d) the Prince of Xue, [[Guo Yuanzhen]], along with a number of his associates\u2014the general Wang Maozhong (\u738b\u6bdb\u4ef2), the officials Jiang Jiao (\u59dc\u768e) and Li Lingwen (\u674e\u4ee4\u554f), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (\u738b\u5b88\u4e00), the [[eunuch]] [[Gao Lishi]], and the military officer Li Shoude (\u674e\u5b88\u5fb7)\u2014and decided to act first.  On 29 July,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A5%C8%A9v&reign=%A5%FD%A4%D1&yy=2&ycanzi=&mm=7&dd=3&dcanzi= \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci.  Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well.  Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging.  Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide.  When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate (\u627f\u5929\u9580) to ascertain what was happening.  Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong's intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong's actions in an edict.  The next day, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall (\u767e\u798f\u6bbf).  Meanwhile, Princess Taiping, hearing what happened to her associates, fled into a temple in the mountains, only appearing three days later.  Emperor Xuanzong ordered her to commit suicide at home, and put to death her sons and associates, except for Xue Chongjian.  It was said that when Emperor Ruizong was at Baifu Hall, the only person who attended to him regularly was Emperor Xuanzong's daughter Princess Shouchun.\n\nIn 716, Emperor Ruizong died at Baifu Hall.  He was enshrined into the imperial temple, along with Emperor Xuanzong's mother Consort Dou, who was posthumously honored an empress.  Emperor Xuanzong had his daughter Princess Wan'an become a Taoist nun to seek blessings for Emperor Ruizong.\n\n==Chancellors during reign==\n\n===First reign===\n* [[Liu Rengui]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Pei Yan]] (684)\n* [[Guo Daiju]] (684)\n* [[Cen Changqian]] (684\u2013690)\n* [[Wei Xuantong]] (684\u2013689)\n* [[Liu Jingxian]] (684)\n* [[Wei Hongmin]] (684)\n* [[Wang Dezhen]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Liu Yizhi]] (684\u2013687)\n* [[Wu Chengsi]] (684, 685, 689\u2013690)\n* [[Li Jingchen]] (684)\n* [[Qian Weidao]] (684\u2013685, 688)\n* [[Shen Junliang]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Cui Cha]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Wei Fangzhi]] (684\u2013690)\n* [[Wei Siqian]] (685\u2013687)\n* [[Pei Judao]] (685\u2013690)\n* [[Su Liangsi]] (685\u2013690)\n* [[Wei Daijia]] (685\u2013689)\n* [[Zhang Guangfu]] (687\u2013689)\n* [[Wang Benli]] (688\u2013690)\n* [[Fan L\u00fcbing]] (689\u2013690)\n* [[Xing Wenwei]] (689\u2013690)\n* [[Wu Youning]] (690)\n\n===Second reign===\n* [[Wei Anshi]] (710, 711)\n* [[Tang Xiujing]] (710)\n* [[Li Jiao (Tang Dynasty)|Li Jiao]] (710)\n* [[Su Gui]] (710)\n* [[Zhang Renyuan]] (710)\n* [[Zhang Xi (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Xi]] (710)\n* [[Pei Tan (8th-century Tang chancellor)|Pei Tan]] (710)\n* [[Cen Xi]] (710, 712)\n* [[Liu Youqiu]] (710\u2013711, 711\u2013712)\n* [[Zhong Shaojing]] (710)\n* [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] (710)\n* [[Li Rizhi]] (710\u2013711)\n* [[Xue Ji]] (710)\n* [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]] (710\u2013711)\n* [[Wei Sili]] (710)\n* [[Xiao Zhizhong]] (710)\n* [[Zhao Yanzhao]] (710)\n* [[Cui Shi]] (710, 711\u2013712)\n* [[Cui Riyong]] (710)\n* [[Song Jing]] (710\u2013711)\n* [[Li Chengqi]] (710){{NoteTag|The office that Li Chengqi held, ''Shangshu Puye'' (\u5c1a\u66f8\u50d5\u5c04), was ordinarily not considered an office for a chancellor by this point.

name=death/>),  personal name '''Li Dan''', also known at times during his life as '''Li Xulun''', '''Li Lun''', '''Wu Lun''', and '''Wu Dan''', was the fifth and ninth emperor of [[Tang Dynasty]]. He was the eighth son of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] and the fourth son of Emperor Gaozong's second wife [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]]. He was wholly a figurehead during his first reign, when he was controlled by his mother, and during his second reign after his mother's death significant power was exercised by his sister [[Princess Taiping]]. \n\nIn February 684, Li Dan's mother Empress Wu demoted his older brother [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] (Li Xian) who had attempted to rule free of his mother, and named him emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).  Emperor Ruizong, however, was a puppet under control of his mother and did not have any real power. From then onwards, the Tang Dynasty existed only in name.And Empress Dowager Wu ruled China for over six years as acting emperor, and then, In October 690 Emperor Ruizong ceded the imperial throne to his mother, who installed herself as empress regnant \u2013 the only woman in Chinese history ever to rule as empress regnant. She also issued a decree that ended the [[Tang dynasty]] and founded the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]].{{NoteTag|Decades earlier, in 653, a minor female agrarian rebel leader, [[Chen Shuozhen]] (\u9673\u78a9\u771f), had claimed the title of \"Empress Regnant Wenjia\" (\u6587\u4f73\u7687\u5e1d), during her rebellion.  However, because her rebellion was very limited in scope and was quickly crushed, she is not typically regarded as a true \"empress regnant.\"  See ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]].  Earlier than that, during [[Northern Wei Dynasty]], [[Empress Dowager Hu (Northern Wei)|Empress Dowager Hu]], after her son [[Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming]]'s death, falsely declared [[Daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming's daughter]] to be a son and declared the daughter to be the new emperor, but almost immediately revealed that the child was in fact female, and thereafter declared [[Yuan Zhao]], the young son of Emperor Xiaoming's cousin Yuan Baohui (\u5143\u5bf6\u6689) emperor. See ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377152|vol. 152]]. Emperor Xiaoming's daughter is also therefore not usually considered a true emperor.}}  Emperor Ruizong was reduced to the position of [[crown prince]], with the unconventional title of ''Huangsi'' (\u7687\u55e3, \"imperial successor\").  In the following years, Empress Wu's nephews [[Wu Chengsi]] and [[Wu Sansi]] tried to have one of them named heir to the throne, but Wu Zetian resisted these calls. Eventually, in October 698, faced with foreign invasion and dissatisfaction at home, Empress Wu accepted the suggestion of the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Di Renjie]] and recalled the exiled Li Xian to the capital [[Luoyang]].  Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the position of crown prince to his elder brother, and Li Xian became crown prince instead.\n\nIn 705, a [[coup]] overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong to the throne.  The five years of Emperor Zhongzong's reign were dominated by Zhongzong's empress consort, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]].  In the beginning of July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei who then named Zhongzong's youngest son [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang). A mere two weeks later, Li Dan's sister [[Princess Taiping]] and Li Dan's son [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] the Prince of Linzi launched a coup which resulted in the death of Empress Wei.  Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother [[Li Chengqi]] the Prince of Song then persuaded Li Dan to take the throne himself, and he agreed, returning to the throne in Emperor Shang's stead.  Li Longji, although not the oldest son, was made crown prince on account of his accomplishments.\n\nSoon, however, tensions between Princess Taiping, who had very many power and supporters, and Li Longji mounted.  Eventually, in September 712, Emperor Ruizong, believing that astrological signs called for a change of emperors, abdicated in favor of Li Longji (as [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]]).  However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong, now carrying the title of ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), continued to wield actual power.  However, in 713, suspecting Princess Taiping of planning a coup, Emperor Xuanzong acted first, killing her associates and forcing her to commit suicide.  After the death of Princess Taiping, Emperor Ruizong himself yielded imperial powers to Emperor Xuanzong and left the governmental scene.  He died in 716.\n\n==Background==\nLi Xulun was born in 662, as the youngest son of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] and his second wife [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] (later known as Wu Zetian).  Later that year, he was created the Prince of Yin.  In 664, he was nominally made the commandant at Ji Prefecture (\u5180\u5dde, roughly modern [[Hengshui]], [[Hebei]]) and the Chanyu Protectorate General (headquarters in modern [[Hohhot]], [[Inner Mongolia]]).  It was said that, as he grew, he became known for humility, the love for his siblings, and talent in [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]].  In 666, his title was changed to Prince of Yu.  In 669, his title was changed to Prince of Ji, and his name was changed from Xulun to Lun.  In 675, his title was changed to Prince of Xiang.  In 678, his title was changed back to Prince of Yu, and his name was further changed to Li Dan.  He was also made the prefect of Luo Prefecture (\u6d1b\u5dde), the prefecture containing the eastern capital [[Luoyang]].  Sometime between 676 and 679, he married his wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Princess Liu]].\n\nEmperor Gaozong died in 683 and was succeeded by Li Dan's older brother [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Zhe]] the [[Crown Prince]] (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Empress Wu retained power as [[empress dowager]] and [[regent]].  In 684, when Emperor Zhongzong displayed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with Li Dan (as Emperor Ruizong), but wielded power even more firmly.  Indeed, she housed Emperor Ruizong in a different palace and did not let him meet the imperial officials or give input on affairs of state.  Emperor Ruizong's wife Princess Liu was created [[empress]], while her son [[Li Chengqi]] was created crown prince.\n\n==First reign under Empress Dowager Wu's regency==\nSoon after Emperor Ruizong took the throne, Empress Dowager Wu carried out a major renaming of governmental offices and banners.  She, who disliked the capital [[Chang'an]], also elevated Luoyang's status, making it a co-equal capital with Chang'an.  She further, at the suggestion of her nephew [[Wu Chengsi]], built an ancestral temple for five generations of her ancestors and had Emperor Ruizong posthumously create them princes.\n\nIn fall 684, [[Li Jingye]] the Duke of Ying (the grandson of the deceased general [[Li Shiji|Li Ji]]), started a rebellion against Empress Dowager Wu at Yang Prefecture, seeking the restoration of Emperor Zhongzong.  Empress Dowager Wu, in response, sent the general Li Xiaoyi (\u674e\u5b5d\u9038), assisted by the generals Li Zhishi (\u674e\u77e5\u5341) and Ma Jingchen (\u99ac\u656c\u81e3) to suppress Li Jianye's rebellion, and Li Xiaoyi quickly did so.  Meanwhile, believing the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Pei Yan]] to be undermining her authority, she executed Pei under accusation of treason and demoted a large number of officials and generals who dared to speak in Pei's defense, later executing some of them.\n\nIn 686, Empress Dowager created a number of bronze boxes designed to encourage secret reports of crimes.  She also began to retain a group of secret police officials to carry out torture and interrogation of people suspected of opposing her rule, including [[Suo Yuanli]], [[Zhou Xing (Tang Dynasty)|Zhou Xing]], and [[Lai Junchen]].  On one occasion, she offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong knew that she was not actually intending to do so, and therefore declined.  She thereafter resumed exercising imperial powers.\n\nEmperor Ruizong had largely stayed out of political matters during these years, but he made an exception in 687, when Empress Dowager Wu believed the chancellor [[Liu Yizhi]], who had previously served on his staff when he was a prince, whom she had trusted and promoted, to have turned against her in favoring that she return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong.  She had Liu accused of corruption and arrested, and Emperor Ruizong personally wrote a petition to request her to spare Liu\u2014which, however, as Liu observed, had the opposite effect, and she ordered Liu to commit suicide.\n\nIn 688, fearing that Empress Dowager Wu was using a ceremony to worship the god of the Luo River (\u6d1b\u6c34, flowing near Luoyang) as an excuse to summon them to Luoyang to slaughter them, the imperial princes considered rebellion, and one was launched by Emperor Ruizong's uncle [[Li Zhen (Tang Dynasty)|Li Zhen]] the Prince of Yue and Li Zhen's son [[Li Chong (Tang Dynasty)|Li Chong]] the Prince of Langye, claiming that Emperor Ruizong was under arrest and needed to be rescued.  However, both Li Zhen and Li Chong were quickly defeated; Li Chong was killed in battle, while Li Zhen committed suicide.  Empress Dowager Wu used this opportunity to carry out a major purge of senior imperial Li clan members, including Emperor Ruizong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (\u674e\u5143\u5609) the Prince of Han and Li Lingkui (\u674e\u9748\u5914) the Prince of Lu.\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu received a number of petitions that she take the throne herself, and Emperor Ruizong also submitted such a petition.  She accepted, and she took the throne as \"empress regnant,\" establishing a new [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou Dynasty]] and interrupting Tang Dynasty.  She demoted Emperor Ruizong to the position of crown prince (with the unusual title ''Huangsi'' (\u7687\u55e3)), and changed his name back to Lun.  She further had him take her family name of Wu.\n\n==During Wu Zetian's reign==\nDespite the fact that Wu Zetian created Li Dan crown prince, she considered creating one of her nephews, Wu Chengsi the Prince of Wei or [[Wu Sansi]] the Prince of Liang crown prince, and a petition drive for Wu Chengsi to be created crown prince reached its peak in 691.  The chancellors [[Cen Changqian]] and [[Ge Fuyuan]] were even executed for opposing it, but Wu Zetian never did carry out the change, and when the leader of the petition drive, Wang Qingzhi (\u738b\u6176\u4e4b) was caned to death by the official [[Li Zhaode]], the petition drive dissipated.\n\nMeanwhile, in 693, Wu Zetian's [[lady in waiting]] Wei Tuan'er (\u97cb\u5718\u5152), who was resentful of Li Dan for reasons lost to history, falsely accused Li Dan's wife Crown Princess Liu and [[concubine]] Consort Dou of witchcraft, and Wu Zetian killed Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou.  In fear of offending Wu Zetian, Li Dan did not dare to mourn either and continued to behave normally.  When Wei Tuan'er tried to further falsely accuse Li Dan, someone in turn reported her activities to Wu Zetian, and Wu Zetian executed her.  Still, thereafter, Li Dan's sons were demoted in rank and kept under secure watch.  Later in 693, the officials Pei Feigong (\u88f4\u532a\u8eac) and Fan Yunxian (\u8303\u96f2\u4ed9) were executed on account of meeting Li Dan secretly, and there were accusations that Li Dan was planning to rebel against Wu Zetian.  Wu Zetian ordered that the officials not be allowed to meet Li Dan, and further arrested his servants to interrogate them.  The secret police official [[Lai Junchen]] tortured Li Dan's servants, and many of them, unable to stand up to the torture, considered falsely implicating Li Dan.  One of them, [[An Jinzang]], however, cut his own belly open and proclaimed Li Dan's innocence.  When Wu Zetian heard this, she sent imperial doctors to save An, and, impressed by An's willingness to die to show Li Dan's innocence, ended the investigation against Li Dan.\n\nIn 698, after Wu Zetian had, at the encouragement of the chancellors [[Di Renjie]], [[Wang Fangqing]], and [[Wang Jishan]], as well as her close associate [[Ji Xu]] and lovers [[Zhang Yizhi]] and [[Zhang Changzong]], recalled Li Zhe from exile, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe.  Wu Zetian agreed, and created Li Zhe crown prince (changing his name initially back to Li Xian and then Wu Xian) and Li Dan the Prince of Xiang.\n\nIn 699, Wu Zetian, in fear that after her death that Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not be able to coexist peacefully, had Li Xian, Li Dan, their sister [[Princess Taiping]], her husband [[Wu Youji]] (Wu Zetian's nephew), and the other Wu clan princes swear an oath to each other and read the oaths to the gods.  The oaths were then carved on iron and kept in the imperial archives.  Later that year, the restrictions on his and Li Xian's sons were lifted, and they were allowed to live outside the palace.\n\nIn 701, when there was an incursion by the [[Eastern Tujue]] khan [[Ashina Mochuo]], Li Dan was put in command of an army to defend against the attack, but before the army could be launched, Ashina Mochuo withdrew.  Subsequently, Li Dan was nominally put in charge of the imperial guards.\n\nIn 702, Wu Zetian put Li Dan in command of an army and made the prefect of Bing Prefecture (\u5e76\u5dde, roughly modern [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]), with Wu Sansi, [[Wu Youning]], and [[Wei Yuanzhong]] as his assistants, apparently preparing to attack Eastern Tujue, but the army was never launched.  Later that year, she had Li Xian, Li Dan, and Princess Taiping submit formal petitions to have Zhang Changzong created a prince.  She then formally rejected the petitions, but created Zhang Changzong and Zhang Yizhi dukes.\n\nIn 703, Li Dan was made the prefect of Yong Prefecture (\u96cd\u5dde, roughly modern [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]), the prefecture that included Chang'an.\n\n==During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign under Empress Wie's shadow==\nIn 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup led by [[Zhang Jianzhi]], [[Cui Xuanwei]], [[Huan Yanfan]], [[Jing Hui]], and [[Yuan Shuji]].  (Yuan was Li Dan's secretary general, and during the coup, Yuan's responsibility was to safeguard Li Dan, suggesting, but not proving, that Li Dan might have known about the coup plans.)  Li Xian was restored to the throne, and he gave Li Dan the special title of ''Anguo Xiangwang'' (\u5b89\u570b\u76f8\u738b), literally \"the Prince of Xiang who pacified the state.\"  Emperor Zhongzong also gave Li Dan the title of ''Taiwei'' (\u592a\u5c09, one of the [[Three Excellencies]]) and made him a chancellor with the designation of ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin'' (\u540c\u4e2d\u66f8\u9580\u4e0b\u4e09\u54c1).  Li Dan declined both honors, and Emperor Zhongzong then offered to create him heir apparent, which Li Dan declined as well.  Emperor Zhongzong subsequently created his son [[Li Chongjun]] crown prince.\n\nIn 707, Li Chongjun, who was not born of Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] (her only son [[Li Chongrun]] having been killed by Wu Zetian), was angry that Empress Wei's daughter Li Guo'er the [[Princess Anle]] and her husband Wu Chongxun (\u6b66\u5d07\u8a13, Wu Sansi's son) repeatedly insulted him and were trying to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to create Li Guo'er crown princess to displace Li Chongjun, rose in rebellion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun.  His subsequent attack on the palace, however, was repelled, and he was killed in flight.  Some of his followers implicated Li Dan and Princess Taiping after they were arrested and interrogated.  Emperor Zhongzong initially had the imperial censor [[Xiao Zhizhong]] put in charge of investigating Li Dan and Princess Taiping, but at Xiao's earnest urging stopped the investigation.\n\nIn 708, when Li Guo'er married again, to Wu Yanxiu (\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0), Li Dan was the ceremonial protector of her litter.\n\n==During Emperor Shang's reign under Empress dowager Wei's regency==\nOn 3 July 710,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A4%A4%A9v&reign=%B4%BA%C0s&yy=4&ycanzi=&mm=&dd=&dcanzi= \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly\u2014a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, so that Empress Wei could be Empress Regnant like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess.  Under a will drafted for Emperor Zhongzong by Princess Taiping and Emperor Zhongzong's concubine [[Shangguan Wan'er|Consort Shangguan Wan'er]], Emperor Zhongzong's son by another concubine, [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] would be named emperor, with Empress Wei serving as empress dowager and regent, but with Li Dan as co-regent.  This plan, however, was opposed by and ultimately altered at the suggestions of Empress Wei's cousin [[Wei Wen]] and [[Zong Chuke]].  After Li Chongmao took the throne (as Emperor Shang), Empress Wei became empress dowager and regent, while Li Dan only received an entirely ceremonial title of senior advisor to the crown prince (\u592a\u5b50\u592a\u5e2b, ''Taizi Taishi'') \u2013 as there was no crown prince at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Empress Dowager Wei's party viewed Li Dan and Princess Taiping as threats and considered eliminating them.  One of her partisans, [[Cui Riyong]], was fearful of what would happen if the plan failed, and therefore informed the plan to Li Dan's son (by Consort Dou) [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] the Prince of Linzi.  Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian (\u859b\u5d07\u7c21), as well as several low level officials close to him \u2013 [[Zhong Shaojing]], Wang Chongye (\u738b\u5d07\u66c4), [[Liu Youqiu]], and Ma Sizong (\u9ebb\u55e3\u5b97) \u2013 to act first.  Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (\u97cb\u64ad) and Gao Song (\u9ad8\u5d69), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (\u845b\u798f\u9806), Chen Xuanli (\u9673\u7384\u79ae), and Li Xianfu (\u674e\u4ed9\u9ce7) thereafter also joined the plot.\n\nWithout first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on 21 July, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Gui (\u97cb\u74bf).  They then attacked the palace.  When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her.  Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and the powerful lady in waiting Lady Helou were killed as well.  Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street.  Li Dan took over as regent, but at the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Emperor Shang and again became emperor.  Emperor Shang was reduced in rank back to Prince of Wen.\n\n==Second reign under Princess Taiping shadow==\n\nEmperor Ruizong was immediately faced with the issue of whom to make crown prince\u2014as Li Chengqi, as the oldest son overall and the oldest son of his wife, was the appropriate heir under [[Confucian]] principles of succession, but Li Longji had been the one whose accomplishments had allowed him to retake the throne.  He hesitated.  Li Chengqi declined consideration to be crown prince\u2014stating to his father:\n\n{{quote|If the state were secure, then consideration should be first given to the oldest son of the wife.  If the state were in danger, then consideration should be first given for achievement.  If you did not follow this principle, the people of the entire empire will be disappointed.  I would rather die than to be placed above the Prince of Ping [(i.e., Li Longji, whose title had been changed to Prince of Ping by this point)].}}\n\nLi Chengqi wept and begged to yield for several days, and after further persuasion by the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Liu Youqiu]] \u2013 who had been part of Li Longji's coup plans\u2014Emperor Ruizong agreed, and created Li Longji crown prince.  Li Longji submitted a petition offering to yield to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong rejected it.\n\nEmperor Ruizong reversed many of Emperor Zhongzong's actions and posthumously honored many people who lost their lives during the reigns of Wu Zetian and Emperor Zhongzong.  He further removed thousands of officials that Emperor Zhongzong had commissioned at the recommendations of powerful courtiers, without having been submitted for examination by the examination (\u9580\u4e0b\u7701, ''Menxia Sheng'') and legislative (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, ''Zhongshu Sheng'') bureaus of government, as was proper.  Meanwhile, though, with Emperor Ruizong considered meek, the court was dominated by two competing factions\u2014of Princess Taiping and Li Longji.  Indeed, it was said that whenever chancellors brought proposals to Emperor Ruizong, Emperor Ruizong would ask them whether they had consulted Princess Taiping and Li Longji, and only act if the chancellors had consulted them.  Princess Taiping, finding Li Longji to be not receptive to her influences, began to spread news of offenses by Li Longji, hoping that he would eventually be removed.  In 711, the chancellors [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]] and [[Song Jing]] tried to defuse the situation by having Princess Taiping sent to Pu Prefecture (\u84b2\u5dde, roughly modern [[Yuncheng]], [[Shanxi]]) and the two princes with arguable better claims on the throne than Li Longji\u2014Li Chengqi and [[Li Shouli]] the Prince of Bin (whose father [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]] (note different tone than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong) \u2013 out of the capital to serve as prefectural prefects, but after their plan was discovered by Princess Taiping, she angrily complained, and was recalled to the capital along with Li Chengqi and Li Shouli.  Yao and Song, credited with reforming the civil service system, were demoted, and it was said that thereafter, the civil service system became as confused as it was during Emperor Zhongzong's reign.\n\nIn 712, the general Sun Quan (\u5b6b\u4f7a), the commandant at You Prefecture (\u5e7d\u5dde, roughly modern [[Beijing]]), aggressively attacked the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] chieftain Li Dabu (\u674e\u5927\u917a), and was defeated by Li Dabu, at the loss of nearly the entire army.\n\nLater in 712, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, ''Dizuo'' (\u5e1d\u5ea7), showed that there would be a change in the emperor's position\u2014believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way.  Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor's position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji.  Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong's insistence finally accepted and took the throne (as Emperor Xuanzong).  However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong's.\n\n==As retired emperor under princess Taiping shadow==\n[[File:\u5510\u777f\u5b97\u674e\u65e6\u6865\u9675.JPG|thumb|Qiaoling (\u6a4b\u9675), the tomb of Emperor Ruizong, in [[Pucheng County, Shaanxi]]]]\nMeanwhile, Princess Taiping continued to be highly influential in governmental matters management through Emperor Ruizong, and most Government officials and chancellors were her associates.  (Of the seven chancellors at the time, five \u2013 [[Dou Huaizhen]], Xiao Zhizhong, [[Cen Xi]], [[Cui Shi]], and [[Lu Xiangxian]] \u2013 were made chancellors at her recommendation, although Lu was not considered a member of her party.)  Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (\u5f35\u6690), with Emperor Xuanzong's approval, planned to mobilize the imperial guards to kill several of those chancellors\u2014Dou, Cui, and Cen  However, after Zhang told the plan to the imperial censor Deng Guangbin (\u9127\u5149\u8cd3), the news was leaked.  Liu was arrested, and initially set to be executed.  Emperor Xuanzong interceded on his behalf with Emperor Ruizong, and Liu, Zhang, and Deng were spared but exiled.\n\nLater in 712, Emperor Ruizong decreed that Emperor Xuanzong lead a group of soldiers to examine the northern border.  However, the group of conscripted soldiers was disbanded in spring 713, and the plan was never carried out.\n\nBy summer 713, it was said that Princesses Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, Cui; along with other officials [[Xue Ji]], Li Jin (\u674e\u6649) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (\u674e\u5fb7\u826f), a cousin of Tang's founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]]), Li You (\u674e\u7337), Jia Yingfu (\u8cc8\u81ba\u798f), Tang Jun (\u5510\u6659); the generals Chang Yuankai (\u5e38\u5143\u6977), Li Ci (\u674e\u6148), and Li Qin (\u674e\u6b3d); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong.  It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the ''[[gastrodia elata]]'' that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac.  When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (\u738b\u741a), Zhang Shuo, and Cui Riyong to act first, did so.  He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Fan (\u674e\u7bc4) the Prince of Qi, Li Ye (\u674e\u696d) the Prince of Xue, [[Guo Yuanzhen]], along with a number of his associates\u2014the general Wang Maozhong (\u738b\u6bdb\u4ef2), the officials Jiang Jiao (\u59dc\u768e) and Li Lingwen (\u674e\u4ee4\u554f), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (\u738b\u5b88\u4e00), the [[eunuch]] [[Gao Lishi]], and the military officer Li Shoude (\u674e\u5b88\u5fb7)\u2014and decided to act first.  On 29 July,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A5%C8%A9v&reign=%A5%FD%A4%D1&yy=2&ycanzi=&mm=7&dd=3&dcanzi= \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci.  Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well.  Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging.  Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide.  When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate (\u627f\u5929\u9580) to ascertain what was happening.  Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong's intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong's actions in an edict.  The next day, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall (\u767e\u798f\u6bbf).  Meanwhile, Princess Taiping, hearing what happened to her associates, fled into a temple in the mountains, only appearing three days later.  Emperor Xuanzong ordered her to commit suicide at home, and put to death her sons and associates, except for Xue Chongjian.  It was said that when Emperor Ruizong was at Baifu Hall, the only person who attended to him regularly was Emperor Xuanzong's daughter Princess Shouchun.\n\nIn 716, Emperor Ruizong died at Baifu Hall.  He was enshrined into the imperial temple, along with Emperor Xuanzong's mother Consort Dou, who was posthumously honored an empress.  Emperor Xuanzong had his daughter Princess Wan'an become a Taoist nun to seek blessings for Emperor Ruizong.\n\n==Chancellors during reign==\n\n===First reign===\n* [[Liu Rengui]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Pei Yan]] (684)\n* [[Guo Daiju]] (684)\n* [[Cen Changqian]] (684\u2013690)\n* [[Wei Xuantong]] (684\u2013689)\n* [[Liu Jingxian]] (684)\n* [[Wei Hongmin]] (684)\n* [[Wang Dezhen]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Liu Yizhi]] (684\u2013687)\n* [[Wu Chengsi]] (684, 685, 689\u2013690)\n* [[Li Jingchen]] (684)\n* [[Qian Weidao]] (684\u2013685, 688)\n* [[Shen Junliang]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Cui Cha]] (684\u2013685)\n* [[Wei Fangzhi]] (684\u2013690)\n* [[Wei Siqian]] (685\u2013687)\n* [[Pei Judao]] (685\u2013690)\n* [[Su Liangsi]] (685\u2013690)\n* [[Wei Daijia]] (685\u2013689)\n* [[Zhang Guangfu]] (687\u2013689)\n* [[Wang Benli]] (688\u2013690)\n* [[Fan L\u00fcbing]] (689\u2013690)\n* [[Xing Wenwei]] (689\u2013690)\n* [[Wu Youning]] (690)\n\n===Second reign===\n* [[Wei Anshi]] (710, 711)\n* [[Tang Xiujing]] (710)\n* [[Li Jiao (Tang Dynasty)|Li Jiao]] (710)\n* [[Su Gui]] (710)\n* [[Zhang Renyuan]] (710)\n* [[Zhang Xi (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Xi]] (710)\n* [[Pei Tan (8th-century Tang chancellor)|Pei Tan]] (710)\n* [[Cen Xi]] (710, 712)\n* [[Liu Youqiu]] (710\u2013711, 711\u2013712)\n* [[Zhong Shaojing]] (710)\n* [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] (710)\n* [[Li Rizhi]] (710\u2013711)\n* [[Xue Ji]] (710)\n* [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]] (710\u2013711)\n* [[Wei Sili]] (710)\n* [[Xiao Zhizhong]] (710)\n* [[Zhao Yanzhao]] (710)\n* [[Cui Shi]] (710, 711\u2013712)\n* [[Cui Riyong]] (710)\n* [[Song Jing]] (710\u2013711)\n* [[Li Chengqi]] (710){{NoteTag|The office that Li Chengqi held, ''Shangshu Puye'' (\u5c1a\u66f8\u50d5\u5c04), was ordinarily not considered an office for a chancellor by this point.

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. \n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]].

For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J. B. Bury, Euric was probably the \"greatest of the Visigothic kings\" for he managed to secure territorial gains denied to his predecessors and even acquired access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{sfn|Bury|2000|pp=211\u2013212}} At his death, the Visigoths were the most powerful of the successor states to the Western Roman Empire and were at the very height of their power.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=846}} Not only had Euric secured significant territory, he and his son, [[Alaric II]], who succeeded him, adopted Roman administrative and bureaucratic governance, including Rome's tax gathering policies and legal codes.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=358\u2013359}}\n\n[[File:Visigothic Kingdom.png|thumb|left|Greatest extent of the Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse in light and dark orange, c. 500.

The center of Visigothic rule shifted first to [[Barcelona]], then inland and south to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=243\u2013245}} From 511 to 526, the Visigoths were ruled by Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths as ''de jure'' regent for the young Amalaric. Theodoric's death in 526, however, enabled the Visigoths to restore their royal line and re-partition the Visigothic kingdom through Amalaric, who incidentally, was more than just Alaric II's son; he was also the grandson of Theodoric the Great through his daughter Theodegotho.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=93}} Amalaric reigned independently for five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=245}} Following Amalaric's assassination in 531, another Ostrogothic ruler, Theudis took his place.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} For the next seventeen years, Theudis held the Visigothic throne.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=94}}\n\nSometime in 549, the Visigoth [[Athanagild]] sought military assistance from Justinian I and while this aide helped Athanagild win his wars, the Romans had much more in mind.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} Granada and southernmost [[Baetica]] were lost to representatives of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (to form the province of [[Spania]]) who had been invited in to help settle this Visigothic dynastic struggle, but who stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a \"Reconquest\" of the far west envisaged by emperor [[Justinian I]].{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=82\u201385}} Imperial Roman armies took advantage of Visigothic rivalries and established a government at C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|p=82}}\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|thumb|right|Visigothic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, before the Muslim conquest]]\n\nThe last Arian Visigothic king, [[Liuvigild]], conquered most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574, the Suevic kingdom in 584, and regained part of the southern areas lost to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]],{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=51\u201353}} which King [[Suintila]] recovered in 624.{{sfn|Arce|1999|p=4}} The kingdom survived until 711, when King [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. This marked the beginning of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], when most of Spain came under [[Islam]]ic rule in the early 8th century.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=96\u2013100}}\n\nA Visigothic nobleman, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]], is credited with beginning the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Iberia in 718, when he defeated the Umayyad forces in the [[Battle of Covadonga]] and established the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in the northern part of the peninsula.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=60}} Other Visigoths who refused to adopt the Muslim faith or live under their rule, fled north to the kingdom of the [[Franks]], and Visigoths played key roles in the empire of [[Charlemagne]] a few generations later. In the early years of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]], a group of Visigoths who remained under Muslim dominance constituted the personal bodyguard of the [[Emir]], [[al-Haras]].{{sfn|Wolf|2014|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nDuring their long reign in Spain, the Visigoths were responsible for the [[Visigothic Kingdom#Founding of cities|only new cities founded in Western Europe between the 5th and 8th centuries]]. It is certain (through contemporary Spanish accounts) that they founded four: [[Reccopolis]], Victoriacum (modern [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], though perhaps [[Iru\u00f1a-Veleia]]), Luceo, and [[Olite]]. There is also a possible fifth city ascribed to them by a later Arabic source: ''Baiyara'' (perhaps modern [[Montoro]]). All of these cities were founded for military purposes and three of them in celebration of victory.

There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]].

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans \u2013 a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths' history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. \n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th-century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war.

Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west.

From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton.

For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

Theodoric's death in 526, however, enabled the Visigoths to restore their royal line and re-partition the Visigothic kingdom through Amalaric, who incidentally, was more than just Alaric II's son; he was also the grandson of Theodoric the Great through his daughter Theodegotho.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=93}} Amalaric reigned independently for five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=245}} Following Amalaric's assassination in 531, another Ostrogothic ruler, Theudis took his place.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} For the next seventeen years, Theudis held the Visigothic throne.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=94}}\n\nSometime in 549, the Visigoth [[Athanagild]] sought military assistance from Justinian I and while this aide helped Athanagild win his wars, the Romans had much more in mind.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} Granada and southernmost [[Baetica]] were lost to representatives of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (to form the province of [[Spania]]) who had been invited in to help settle this Visigothic dynastic struggle, but who stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a \"Reconquest\" of the far west envisaged by emperor [[Justinian I]].{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=82\u201385}} Imperial Roman armies took advantage of Visigothic rivalries and established a government at C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|p=82}}\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|thumb|right|Visigothic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, before the Muslim conquest]]\n\nThe last Arian Visigothic king, [[Liuvigild]], conquered most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574, the Suevic kingdom in 584, and regained part of the southern areas lost to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]],{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=51\u201353}} which King [[Suintila]] recovered in 624.{{sfn|Arce|1999|p=4}} The kingdom survived until 711, when King [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the [[Battle of Guadalete]].

There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles.
