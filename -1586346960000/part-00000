{"title_page": "URL redirection", "text_new": "{{Selfref|For redirection on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Redirect]].}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''URL redirection''', also called '''URL forwarding''', is a [[World Wide Web]] technique for making a [[web page]] available under more than one [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] address. When a [[web browser]] attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL [[Domain name|domain]] are redirected to a different domain, as when [http://www.wikipedia.com wikipedia.com] and [http://www.wikipedia.net wikipedia.net] are automatically redirected to [http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia.org].\n\nURL redirection is done for various reasons:\n* for [[URL shortening]];\n* to prevent [[link rot|broken links]] when web pages are moved;\n* to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single [[website|web site]];\n* to guide navigation into and out of a website;\n* for privacy protection; and\n* for hostile purposes such as [[phishing]] attacks or malware distribution.\n\n== Purposes ==\nThere are several reasons to use URL redirection:\n\n=== Similar domain names ===\nA user might mistype a URL, for example, \"example.com\" and \"exmaple.com\". Organizations often register these \"misspelled\" domains and redirect them to the \"correct\" location: example.com. The addresses example.com and example.net could both redirect to a single domain, or web page, such as example.org. This technique is often used to \"reserve\" other [[top-level domain]]s (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a true \".edu\" or \".net\" to redirect to a more recognizable \".com\" domain.\n\n=== Moving pages to a new domain ===\nWeb pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:\n* a site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;\n* an author might move his or her individual pages to a new domain;\n* two web sites might merge.\n\nWith URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers. The same applies to [[search engine]]s. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a \"moved permanently\" redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.\n\n=== Logging outgoing links ===\nThe access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site.  They do not, however, log which links visitors left by.  This is because the visitor's browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link. This information can be captured in several ways.  One way involves URL redirection.  Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website's domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website's server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = Google revives redirect snoopery\n  | journal = Blog.anta.net\n  | date = 29 January 2009\n  | url = http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | issn = 1797-1993\n  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817024348/http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | archivedate=17 August 2011\n}}</ref> The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.\n\n=== Short aliases for long URLs ===\n{{Main|URL shortening}}\n\nWeb applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of [[microblogging]] sites. [[URL shortening]] services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.\n\n=== Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ===\n{{See also|Permalink|PURL|Link rot}}\n\nSometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore, URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.\n\n=== Post/Redirect/Get ===\n{{Main|Post/Redirect/Get}}\n\nPost/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a [[web development]] [[design pattern]] that prevents some duplicate [[form (web)|form]] submissions if the user clicks the refresh button after submitting the form, creating a more intuitive interface for [[user agent]]s (users).\n\n=== Device targeting and geotargeting ===\n\nRedirects can be effectively used for targeting purposes like [[geotargeting]]. Device targeting has become increasingly important with the rise of mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website [[responsive web design|responsive]] or redirect to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client-side redirects or non-cacheable server-side redirects are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server-side redirects are used for Geotargeting but client-side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Total Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating search engines ===\nRedirects have been used to manipulate search engines with unethical intentions, e.g., [[URL hijacking]]. The goal of misleading redirects is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky redirects to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain redirect technique<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-discussing-302-redirects/ |title=SEO advice: discussing 302 redirects |date=4 January 2006 |publisher=Matt Cutts, former Head of Google Webspam Team}}</ref> that exploited the nature of the search engine's handling for temporary redirects. If a temporary redirect is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target URL. The URL that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results, as the redirect indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behaviour by applying temporary redirects to well-ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the redirect, therefore \"stealing\" the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kinds of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en |title=Sneaky Redirects |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=Google Webmaster Guidelines}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating visitors ===\nURL redirection is sometimes used as a part of [[phishing]] attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet |title=Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet |date=21 August 2014 |publisher=Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)}}</ref> Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and installing a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] of some sort instead.\n\n=== Removing <code>referer</code> information ===\nWhen a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the [[HTTP request]] a field called [[HTTP referer|referer]] which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the [[server log|logs]] of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, <code><nowiki>http://company.com/plans-for-the-next-release-of-our-product</nowiki></code>), it is not desirable for the <code>referer</code> URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs [[Referer#Referrer hiding|referrer hiding]] could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example <code><nowiki>http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code> into <code><nowiki>http://redirect.company.com/http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code>. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referer URL, such as the [[session ID]], and can reduce the chance of [[phishing]] by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.\n\n== Implementation ==\nSeveral different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection.  These vary in whether they affect [[HTTP headers]] or HTML content.  The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system.  For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a [[meta refresh|Refresh meta tag]] whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n=== Manual redirect ===\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back&nbsp;\u2014 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n=== HTTP status codes 3xx ===\nIn the [[HTTP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by the [[World Wide Web]], a '''redirect''' is a response with a [[List of HTTP status codes|status code]] beginning with ''3'' that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.\n\nHTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):\n* [[HTTP 300|300 multiple choices]] (e.g. offer different languages)\n* [[HTTP 301|301 moved permanently]] (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)\n* [[HTTP 302|302 found]] (originally \"temporary redirect\" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n* [[HTTP 303|303 see other]] (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n* [[HTTP 307|307 temporary redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n* [[HTTP 308|308 permanent redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n\n==== Redirect status codes and characteristics ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! HTTP Status Code !! HTTP Version !! Temporary / Permanent !! Cacheable !! Request Method Subsequent Request\n|-\n| 301 || HTTP/1.0 || Permanent || {{yes}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 302 || HTTP/1.0 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 303 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no|never}} || always GET\n|-\n| 307 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || may not change\n|-\n| 308 || HTTP/1.1 || Permanent || {{yes2|by default}} || may not change\n|-\n|}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Complete Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\nAll of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n(Status codes [[HTTP 304|304 not modified]] and [[HTTP 305|305 use proxy]] are not redirects).\n\n==== Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ====\n\nA [[HTTP]] response with the 301 \"moved permanently\" redirect looks like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://www.google.org/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 174\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Moved</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Moved</h1>\n<p>This page has moved to <a href=\"http://www.example.org/\">http://www.google.org/</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Using server-side scripting for redirection ====\nWeb authors producing HTML content can't usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling \"non-parsed-headers\").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a \"Location:\" header line.  For example, in [[PHP]], one can use the \"header\" function:\n\n<source lang=\"php\">\nheader('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');\nheader('Location: http://www.example.com/');\nexit();\n</source>\n\nMore headers may be required to prevent caching.<ref name=\"php-301-robust-solution\">{{cite web|url=http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution/ |title=PHP Redirects: 302 to 301 Rock Solid Robust Solution |publisher=WebSiteFactors.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012042703/http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution |archivedate=12 October 2012}}</ref> The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the [[Active Server Pages|ASP scripting]] language, this can also be accomplished using <code>response.buffer=true</code> and <code>response.redirect <nowiki>\"http://www.example.com/\"</nowiki></code> HTTP/1.1 allows for either a relative URI reference or an absolute URI reference.<ref>{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 7.1.2 | sectionname = Location | page = 68 | editor1 = Roy T.

Typical configuration directives look like:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRedirect permanent /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\nRedirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\n</source>\n\nFor more flexible [[URL rewriting]] and redirection, Apache mod_rewrite can be used. E.g., to redirect a requests to a canonical domain name:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.:]+\\.)*oldsite\\.example\\.com\\.?(:[0-9]*)?$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://newsite.example.net/$1 [R=301,L]\n</source>\n\nSuch configuration can be applied to one or all sites on the server through the server configuration files or to a single content directory through a <code>[[.htaccess]]</code> file.\n\n==== nginx rewrite ====\n[[Nginx]] has an integrated http rewrite module,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nginx.org/r/rewrite |title=Module ngx_http_rewrite_module - rewrite |publisher=nginx.org |accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> which can be used to perform advanced URL processing and even web-page generation (with the <tt>return</tt> directive).  A showing example of such advanced use of the rewrite module is [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su], which implements a deterministic [[URL shortening]] service entirely with the help of nginx configuration language alone.<ref>{{cite mailing list |date=18 February 2013 |url=http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2013-February/037592.html |mailinglist=nginx@nginx.org |title=A dynamic web-site written wholly in nginx.conf?

This can specify a new URL to replace one page with another.  This is supported by most web browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp|title=HTML meta tag|website=www.w3schools.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|title=An Exploration of Dynamic Documents|date=2 August 2002|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802170847/http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|archivedate=2 August 2002|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A timeout of zero seconds effects an immediate redirect. This is treated like a 301 permanent redirect by Google, allowing transfer of PageRank to the target page.<ref>[http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/ \"Google and Yahoo accept undelayed meta refreshs as 301 redirects\"]. Sebastian's Pamphlets. 3 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThis is an example of a simple HTML document that uses this technique:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Refresh\" content=\"0; url=http://www.example.com/\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n  <p>Please follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThis technique can be used by [[Web designer|web authors]] because the meta tag is contained inside the document itself.  The meta tag must be placed in the \"head\" section of the HTML file.  The number \"0\" in this example may be replaced by another number to achieve a delay of that many seconds.  The anchor in the \"body\" section is for users whose browsers do not support this feature.\n\nThe same effect can be achieved with an HTTP <code>refresh</code> header:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nRefresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 78\n\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis response is easier to generate by CGI programs because one does not need to change the default status code.\n\nHere is a simple CGI program that effects this redirect:\n<source lang=\"perl\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint \"Refresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Content-Type: text/html\\r\\n\";\nprint \"\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Please follow <a href=\\\"http://www.example.com/\\\">this link</a>!\"\n</source>\n\nNote: Usually, the HTTP server adds the status line and the Content-Length header automatically.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] discourage the use of meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or [[search engine]]). The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-no-periodic-refresh|title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate.  Some articles that they have written on the issue include [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-movement W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes], Use standard redirects: don't break the back button!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback|title=Use standard redirects|first=the QA|last=Team|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> and Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 section 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#auto-page-refresh|title=Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref>\n\n=== JavaScript redirects ===\n[[JavaScript]] can cause a redirect by setting the <code>window.location</code> attribute, e.g.:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location='http://www.example.com/'\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNormally JavaScript pushes the redirector site's [[URL]] to the browser's history. It can cause redirect loops when users hit the back button. With the following command you can prevent this type of behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insider.zone/tools/client-side-url-redirect-generator/|title=Cross-browser client side URL redirect generator|publisher=Insider Zone}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location.replace('http://www.example.com/')\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHowever, HTTP headers or the refresh meta tag may be preferred for security reasons and because JavaScript will not be executed by some browsers and many [[web crawler]]s.\n\n=== Frame redirects ===\n\nA slightly different effect can be achieved by creating an inline frame:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<iframe height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"http://www.example.com/\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">link</a>.\n</iframe>\n</source>\n\nOne main difference to the above redirect methods is that for a frame redirect, the browser displays the URL of the frame document and not the URL of the target page in the URL bar. This ''cloaking'' technique may be used so that the reader sees a more memorable URL or to fraudulently conceal a [[phishing]] site as part of [[website spoofing]].<ref>Aaron Emigh (19 January 2005).

For example, the URL \"http://wikipedia.com\" (with \"*.com\" as domain) is first redirected to https://www.wikipedia.org/ (with domain name in [[.org]]), where you can navigate to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/ language-specific site]. This is unavoidable if the different links in the chain are served by different servers though it should be minimised by ''[[rewriting]]'' the URL as much as possible on the server before returning it to the browser as a redirect.\n\nWikipedia has been redirecting its pages to HTTPS by default since 2015.<ref>[https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/12/wikipedia-to-start-using-secure-https-by-default-for-all-users/ Wikipedia to start using secure HTTPS by default for all users] VentureBeat article, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n=== Redirect loops ===\nSometimes a mistake can cause a page to end up redirecting back to itself, possibly via other pages, leading to an infinite sequence of redirects. Browsers should stop redirecting after a certain number of hops and display an error message.\n\nThe HTTP/1.1 Standard states:<ref name=\"rfc7231sec6.4\">{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 6.4 | sectionname = Redirection 3xx | page = 54 | editor1 = Roy T.

The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the [[Domain Name System]]. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using [[AJAX]] as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n==== History ====\nThe first redirect services took advantage of [[top-level domains]] (TLD) such as \"[[.to]]\" (Tonga), \"[[.at]]\" (Austria) and \"[[.is]]\" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including \"r.im\", \"go.to\", \"i.am\", \"come.to\" and \"start.at\".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net gains for tiny Pacific nation | date=14 September 2007 | accessdate=27 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232450/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | archivedate=12 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $70.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined. With the launch of [[TinyURL]] in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely [[URL shortening]]. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular [[Twitter]] service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n=== Referrer masking ===\nRedirection services can hide the [[referrer]] by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a [[session ID]] in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective [[phishing]]  .\n\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in [[PHP]].\n<source lang=\"html+php\">\n<?php\n$url = htmlspecialchars($_GET['url']);\nheader('Refresh: 0; url=http://' . $url);\n?>\n<!-- Fallback using meta refresh. -->\n<html>\n <head>\n  <title>Redirecting...</title>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=http://<?= $url; ?>\">\n </head>\n <body>\n Attempting to redirect to <a href=\"http://<?= $url; ?>\">http://<?= $url; ?></a>.\n </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the URL provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server's resources.\n\n==Security issues==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for [[phishing]] attacks, such as [[Open Redirect|open redirect]] and [[Covert Redirect|covert redirect]]. \"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation.\"<ref name=\"Open_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect | title=Open Redirect |publisher= OWASP |date=16 March 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> \"Covert redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation.\"<ref name=\"Covert_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=http://tetraph.com/covert_redirect/ | title=Covert Redirect |publisher= Tetraph |date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> It was disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.<ref name=\"CNET\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-and-openid-discovered/ | title=Serious security flaw in OAuth, OpenID discovered |publisher= CNET |date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canonical link element]]\n* [[Canonical meta tag]]\n* [[Domain masking]]\n* [[Link rot]]\n* [[Semantic URL]]\n* [[URL normalization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations]\n* [http://www2007.org/workshops/paper_115.pdf Taxonomy of JavaScript Redirection Spam] (Microsoft Live Labs)\n* [http://projects.webappsec.org/URL-Redirector-Abuse Security vulnerabilities in URL Redirectors] The Web Application Security Consortium Threat Classification\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Url Redirection}}\n[[Category:URL]]\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Internet search]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Selfref|For redirection on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Redirect]].}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''URL redirection''', also called '''URL forwarding''', is a [[World Wide Web]] technique for making a [[web page]] available under more than one [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] address. When a [[web browser]] attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL [[Domain name|domain]] are redirected to a different domain, as when [http://www.wikipedia.com wikipedia.com] and [http://www.wikipedia.net wikipedia.net] are automatically redirected to [http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia.org].\n\nURL redirection is done for various reasons:\n* for [[URL shortening]];\n* to prevent [[link rot|broken links]] when web pages are moved;\n* to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single [[website|web site]];\n* to guide navigation into and out of a website;\n* for privacy protection; and\n* for hostile purposes such as [[phishing]] attacks or malware distribution.\n\n== Purposes ==\nThere are several reasons to use URL redirection:\n\n=== Similar domain names ===\nA user might mistype a URL, for example, \"example.com\" and \"exmaple.com\". Organizations often register these \"misspelled\" domains and redirect them to the \"correct\" location: example.com. The addresses example.com and example.net could both redirect to a single domain, or web page, such as example.org. This technique is often used to \"reserve\" other [[top-level domain]]s (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a true \".edu\" or \".net\" to redirect to a more recognizable \".com\" domain.\n\n=== Moving pages to a new domain ===\nWeb pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:\n* a site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;\n* an author might move his or her individual pages to a new domain;\n* two web sites might merge.\n\nWith URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers. The same applies to [[search engine]]s. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a \"moved permanently\" redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.\n\n=== Logging outgoing links ===\nThe access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site.  They do not, however, log which links visitors left by.  This is because the visitor's browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link. This information can be captured in several ways.  One way involves URL redirection.  Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website's domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website's server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = Google revives redirect snoopery\n  | journal = Blog.anta.net\n  | date = 29 January 2009\n  | url = http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | issn = 1797-1993\n  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817024348/http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | archivedate=17 August 2011\n}}</ref> The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.\n\n=== Short aliases for long URLs ===\n{{Main|URL shortening}}\n\nWeb applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of [[microblogging]] sites. [[URL shortening]] services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.\n\n=== Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ===\n{{See also|Permalink|PURL|Link rot}}\n\nSometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore, URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.\n\n=== Post/Redirect/Get ===\n{{Main|Post/Redirect/Get}}\n\nPost/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a [[web development]] [[design pattern]] that prevents some duplicate [[form (web)|form]] submissions if the user clicks the refresh button after submitting the form, creating a more intuitive interface for [[user agent]]s (users).\n\n=== Device targeting and geotargeting ===\n\nRedirects can be effectively used for targeting purposes like [[geotargeting]]. Device targeting has become increasingly important with the rise of mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website [[responsive web design|responsive]] or redirect to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client-side redirects or non-cacheable server-side redirects are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server-side redirects are used for Geotargeting but client-side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Total Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating search engines ===\nRedirects have been used to manipulate search engines with unethical intentions, e.g., [[URL hijacking]]. The goal of misleading redirects is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky redirects to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain redirect technique<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-discussing-302-redirects/ |title=SEO advice: discussing 302 redirects |date=4 January 2006 |publisher=Matt Cutts, former Head of Google Webspam Team}}</ref> that exploited the nature of the search engine's handling for temporary redirects. If a temporary redirect is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target URL. The URL that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results, as the redirect indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behaviour by applying temporary redirects to well-ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the redirect, therefore \"stealing\" the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kinds of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en |title=Sneaky Redirects |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=Google Webmaster Guidelines}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating visitors ===\nURL redirection is sometimes used as a part of [[phishing]] attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet |title=Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet |date=21 August 2014 |publisher=Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)}}</ref> Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and installing a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] of some sort instead.\n\n=== Removing <code>referer</code> information ===\nWhen a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the [[HTTP request]] a field called [[HTTP referer|referer]] which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the [[server log|logs]] of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, <code><nowiki>http://company.com/plans-for-the-next-release-of-our-product</nowiki></code>), it is not desirable for the <code>referer</code> URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs [[Referer#Referrer hiding|referrer hiding]] could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example <code><nowiki>http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code> into <code><nowiki>http://redirect.company.com/http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code>. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referer URL, such as the [[session ID]], and can reduce the chance of [[phishing]] by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.\n\n== Implementation ==\nSeveral different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection.  These vary in whether they affect [[HTTP headers]] or HTML content.  The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system.  For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a [[meta refresh|Refresh meta tag]] whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n=== Manual redirect ===\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back&nbsp;\u2014 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n=== HTTP status codes 3xx ===\nIn the [[HTTP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by the [[World Wide Web]], a '''redirect''' is a response with a [[List of HTTP status codes|status code]] beginning with ''3'' that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.\n\nHTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):\n* [[HTTP 300|300 multiple choices]] (e.g. offer different languages)\n* [[HTTP 301|301 moved permanently]] (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)\n* [[HTTP 302|302 found]] (originally \"temporary redirect\" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n* [[HTTP 303|303 see other]] (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n* [[HTTP 307|307 temporary redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n* [[HTTP 308|308 permanent redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n\n==== Redirect status codes and characteristics ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! HTTP Status Code !! HTTP Version !! Temporary / Permanent !! Cacheable !! Request Method Subsequent Request\n|-\n| 301 || HTTP/1.0 || Permanent || {{yes}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 302 || HTTP/1.0 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 303 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no|never}} || always GET\n|-\n| 307 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || may not change\n|-\n| 308 || HTTP/1.1 || Permanent || {{yes2|by default}} || may not change\n|-\n|}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Complete Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\nAll of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n(Status codes [[HTTP 304|304 not modified]] and [[HTTP 305|305 use proxy]] are not redirects).\n\n==== Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ====\n\nA [[HTTP]] response with the 301 \"moved permanently\" redirect looks like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://www.example.org/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 174\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Moved</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Moved</h1>\n<p>This page has moved to <a href=\"http://www.example.org/\">http://www.example.org/</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Using server-side scripting for redirection ====\nWeb authors producing HTML content can't usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling \"non-parsed-headers\").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a \"Location:\" header line.  For example, in [[PHP]], one can use the \"header\" function:\n\n<source lang=\"php\">\nheader('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');\nheader('Location: http://www.example.com/');\nexit();\n</source>\n\nMore headers may be required to prevent caching.<ref name=\"php-301-robust-solution\">{{cite web|url=http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution/ |title=PHP Redirects: 302 to 301 Rock Solid Robust Solution |publisher=WebSiteFactors.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012042703/http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution |archivedate=12 October 2012}}</ref> The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the [[Active Server Pages|ASP scripting]] language, this can also be accomplished using <code>response.buffer=true</code> and <code>response.redirect <nowiki>\"http://www.example.com/\"</nowiki></code> HTTP/1.1 allows for either a relative URI reference or an absolute URI reference.<ref>{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 7.1.2 | sectionname = Location | page = 68 | editor1 = Roy T.

Typical configuration directives look like:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRedirect permanent /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\nRedirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\n</source>\n\nFor more flexible [[URL rewriting]] and redirection, Apache mod_rewrite can be used. E.g., to redirect a requests to a canonical domain name:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.:]+\\.)*oldsite\\.example\\.com\\.?(:[0-9]*)?$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://newsite.example.net/$1 [R=301,L]\n</source>\n\nSuch configuration can be applied to one or all sites on the server through the server configuration files or to a single content directory through a <code>[[.htaccess]]</code> file.\n\n==== nginx rewrite ====\n[[Nginx]] has an integrated http rewrite module,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nginx.org/r/rewrite |title=Module ngx_http_rewrite_module - rewrite |publisher=nginx.org |accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> which can be used to perform advanced URL processing and even web-page generation (with the <tt>return</tt> directive).  A showing example of such advanced use of the rewrite module is [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su], which implements a deterministic [[URL shortening]] service entirely with the help of nginx configuration language alone.<ref>{{cite mailing list |date=18 February 2013 |url=http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2013-February/037592.html |mailinglist=nginx@nginx.org |title=A dynamic web-site written wholly in nginx.conf?

This can specify a new URL to replace one page with another.  This is supported by most web browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp|title=HTML meta tag|website=www.w3schools.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|title=An Exploration of Dynamic Documents|date=2 August 2002|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802170847/http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|archivedate=2 August 2002|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A timeout of zero seconds effects an immediate redirect.

Sebastian's Pamphlets. 3 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThis is an example of a simple HTML document that uses this technique:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Refresh\" content=\"0; url=http://www.example.com/\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n  <p>Please follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThis technique can be used by [[Web designer|web authors]] because the meta tag is contained inside the document itself.  The meta tag must be placed in the \"head\" section of the HTML file.  The number \"0\" in this example may be replaced by another number to achieve a delay of that many seconds.  The anchor in the \"body\" section is for users whose browsers do not support this feature.\n\nThe same effect can be achieved with an HTTP <code>refresh</code> header:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nRefresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 78\n\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis response is easier to generate by CGI programs because one does not need to change the default status code.\n\nHere is a simple CGI program that effects this redirect:\n<source lang=\"perl\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint \"Refresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Content-Type: text/html\\r\\n\";\nprint \"\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Please follow <a href=\\\"http://www.example.com/\\\">this link</a>!\"\n</source>\n\nNote: Usually, the HTTP server adds the status line and the Content-Length header automatically.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] discourage the use of meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or [[search engine]]). The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-no-periodic-refresh|title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate.  Some articles that they have written on the issue include [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-movement W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes], Use standard redirects: don't break the back button!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback|title=Use standard redirects|first=the QA|last=Team|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> and Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 section 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#auto-page-refresh|title=Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref>\n\n=== JavaScript redirects ===\n[[JavaScript]] can cause a redirect by setting the <code>window.location</code> attribute, e.g.:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location='http://www.example.com/'\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNormally JavaScript pushes the redirector site's [[URL]] to the browser's history. It can cause redirect loops when users hit the back button. With the following command you can prevent this type of behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insider.zone/tools/client-side-url-redirect-generator/|title=Cross-browser client side URL redirect generator|publisher=Insider Zone}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location.replace('http://www.example.com/')\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHowever, HTTP headers or the refresh meta tag may be preferred for security reasons and because JavaScript will not be executed by some browsers and many [[web crawler]]s.\n\n=== Frame redirects ===\n\nA slightly different effect can be achieved by creating an inline frame:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<iframe height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"http://www.example.com/\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">link</a>.\n</iframe>\n</source>\n\nOne main difference to the above redirect methods is that for a frame redirect, the browser displays the URL of the frame document and not the URL of the target page in the URL bar. This ''cloaking'' technique may be used so that the reader sees a more memorable URL or to fraudulently conceal a [[phishing]] site as part of [[website spoofing]].<ref>Aaron Emigh (19 January 2005).

For example, the URL \"http://wikipedia.com\" (with \"*.com\" as domain) is first redirected to https://www.wikipedia.org/ (with domain name in [[.org]]), where you can navigate to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/ language-specific site]. This is unavoidable if the different links in the chain are served by different servers though it should be minimised by ''[[rewriting]]'' the URL as much as possible on the server before returning it to the browser as a redirect.\n\nWikipedia has been redirecting its pages to HTTPS by default since 2015.<ref>[https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/12/wikipedia-to-start-using-secure-https-by-default-for-all-users/ Wikipedia to start using secure HTTPS by default for all users] VentureBeat article, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n=== Redirect loops ===\nSometimes a mistake can cause a page to end up redirecting back to itself, possibly via other pages, leading to an infinite sequence of redirects. Browsers should stop redirecting after a certain number of hops and display an error message.\n\nThe HTTP/1.1 Standard states:<ref name=\"rfc7231sec6.4\">{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 6.4 | sectionname = Redirection 3xx | page = 54 | editor1 = Roy T. Fielding | editor1-link = Roy Fielding | editor2 = Julian F. Reschke | year = 2014 | publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nA client ''SHOULD'' detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e., \"infinite\" redirection loops).\n\nNote: An earlier version of this specification recommended a maximum of five redirections ([RFC 2068], Section 10.3).  Content developers need to be aware that some clients might implement such a fixed limitation.\n</blockquote>\nNote that the URLs in the sequence might not repeat, e.g.: http://www.example.com/1{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -> http://www.example.com/2{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -> http://www.example.com/3{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ...\n\n== Services ==\nThere exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.\n\n=== URL redirection services ===\nA '''redirect service''' is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the [[Domain Name System]]. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using [[AJAX]] as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n==== History ====\nThe first redirect services took advantage of [[top-level domains]] (TLD) such as \"[[.to]]\" (Tonga), \"[[.at]]\" (Austria) and \"[[.is]]\" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including \"r.im\", \"go.to\", \"i.am\", \"come.to\" and \"start.at\".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net gains for tiny Pacific nation | date=14 September 2007 | accessdate=27 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232450/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | archivedate=12 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $70.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined. With the launch of [[TinyURL]] in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely [[URL shortening]]. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular [[Twitter]] service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n=== Referrer masking ===\nRedirection services can hide the [[referrer]] by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a [[session ID]] in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective [[phishing]]  .\n\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in [[PHP]].\n<source lang=\"html+php\">\n<?php\n$url = htmlspecialchars($_GET['url']);\nheader('Refresh: 0; url=http://' . $url);\n?>\n<!-- Fallback using meta refresh. -->\n<html>\n <head>\n  <title>Redirecting...</title>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=http://<?= $url; ?>\">\n </head>\n <body>\n Attempting to redirect to <a href=\"http://<?= $url; ?>\">http://<?= $url; ?></a>.\n </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the URL provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server's resources.\n\n==Security issues==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for [[phishing]] attacks, such as [[Open Redirect|open redirect]] and [[Covert Redirect|covert redirect]]. \"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation.\"<ref name=\"Open_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect | title=Open Redirect |publisher= OWASP |date=16 March 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> \"Covert redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation.\"<ref name=\"Covert_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=http://tetraph.com/covert_redirect/ | title=Covert Redirect |publisher= Tetraph |date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> It was disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.<ref name=\"CNET\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-and-openid-discovered/ | title=Serious security flaw in OAuth, OpenID discovered |publisher= CNET |date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canonical link element]]\n* [[Canonical meta tag]]\n* [[Domain masking]]\n* [[Link rot]]\n* [[Semantic URL]]\n* [[URL normalization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations]\n* [http://www2007.org/workshops/paper_115.pdf Taxonomy of JavaScript Redirection Spam] (Microsoft Live Labs)\n* [http://projects.webappsec.org/URL-Redirector-Abuse Security vulnerabilities in URL Redirectors] The Web Application Security Consortium Threat Classification\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Url Redirection}}\n[[Category:URL]]\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Internet search]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n", "name_user": "58.145.191.236", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExample HTTP response for a 301 redirect)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection"}

People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [[bias]]ed way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for [[emotion]]ally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched [[belief]]s.\n\nPeople also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).\n\nA series of [[Experimental psychology|psychological experiments]] in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include [[wishful thinking]] and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way. However, even scientists and intelligent people can be prone to confirmation bias.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Lee|first1=C.J.|last2=Sugimoto|first2=C.R.|last3=Zhang|first3=G.|last4=Cronin|first4=B.|year=2013|title=Bias in peer review|journal=J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec|volume=64|pages=2\u201317|doi=10.1002/asi.22784}}<br />*{{Citation|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=1|issue=3|pages=229\u201338|title=Psychology of the scientist: An analysis of problem-solving bias|first1=Michael J.|last1=Mahoney |first2=B.G.|last2=DeMonbreun |year=1977|doi=10.1007/BF01186796}}<br />*{{Citation|title=Norms and counter-norms in a select group of the Apollo moon scientists: A case study of the ambivalence of scientists|first=I.

Participants knew that one basket contained 60% black and 40% red balls; the other, 40% black and 60% red. The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn, a sequence that does not favor either basket. After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw\u2014whether they initially thought the basket with 60% black balls or the one with 60% red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball.

Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable.

For example, they could read the [[National Rifle Association]]'s and the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition]]'s arguments on gun control.

People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [[bias]]ed way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for [[emotion]]ally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched [[belief]]s.\n\nPeople also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).\n\nA series of [[Experimental psychology|psychological experiments]] in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include [[wishful thinking]] and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.

Participants knew that one basket contained 60% black and 40% red balls; the other, 40% black and 60% red. The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn, a sequence that does not favor either basket. After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw\u2014whether they initially thought the basket with 60% black balls or the one with 60% red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball. They did not show the polarization effect, suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions, but rather when they openly commit to them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|p=201}}</ref>\n\nA less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence.

The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of [[gun politics|gun control]] and [[affirmative action]].<ref name=\"taber_political\" /> They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate. Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable. In part of this study, participants chose which information sources to read, from a list prepared by the experimenters. For example, they could read the [[National Rifle Association]]'s and the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition]]'s arguments on gun control. Even when instructed to be even-handed, participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not.

To reach these goals, the cabinet set up the CPIRD Office in 1997 to oversee the project's activities. In terms of education, the preclinic level of study (years 1-3) will take place at the student's university or college. At the clinical level of study (years 4-6), study will take place at hospitals all around the country under the guidance of the MOPH.

The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell.  Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes.

Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a [[signal peptide|signal sequence]]. The N-terminus (one end) of a [[polypeptide]] chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few [[amino acid]]s that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination.

Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s and moved along the [[cytoskeleton]] toward their destination.

It was Thomas's younger brother, however, who would fund these changes; [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Admiral George Anson]], created Lord Anson in 1747 and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in 1751, amassed a great fortune during his naval career, and when he died without issue he left the majority to his elder brother.<ref name=\"A Brief History of Shugborough\"/> Thomas also died childless and the estate passed to his sister's son, George Adams, who adopted the surname Anson by royal licence.<ref name=\"A Brief History of Shugborough\"/>\n\nIn 1806, George's son Thomas (1767\u20131818) was created 1st Viscount Anson. His son, the [[Thomas William Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield|2nd viscount]], would be created 1st Earl of Lichfield in the [[coronation]] honours of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. The Earl led an extravagant lifestyle and amassed several large debts, which, in 1842, forced him to sell the entire contents of the house in a two-week-long sale. While the [[Thomas George Anson, 2nd Earl of Lichfield|2nd earl]] did much to restore the house and contents to its former glory, by the time his son inherited the estate it was heavily [[mortgage]]d.\n\nIn 1831, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, the future [[Queen Victoria]], then 13, visited Shugborough with her mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], as part of an extensive tour of the country.

The hall, as it is seen today, is built in a [[neo-classical architecture|neo-classical]] style and encased in [[slate]], sanded to resemble stone.<ref name=\"A Brief History of Shugborough\"/>\n\n<center><gallery>\nFile:Shugborough Hall Jones' Views 1829.jpg|Shugborough Hall in the 1820s\nFile:Shugborough Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1350373.jpg|The 18th century [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[portico]]\nFile:Shugborough rear 1.JPG|The rear fa\u00e7ade of the hall\nFile:Shugborough garden view.JPG|The garden from the house\nFile:Stable block, Shugborough Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1350369.jpg|The stable block in 2009\nFile:Shugborough Hall 01.jpg|The hall seen from a [[hot air balloon]]\nFile:River Sow at Shugborough Hall,.JPG|[[River Sow]] at the rear of the Hall\nFile:Shugborough Hall farmhouse.JPG|The farmhouse\n</gallery></center>\n\n===The park and follies===\nLike many landowners of his time, Thomas Anson (1695\u20131773) took a keen interest in the landscaping of his parkland. The land around Shugborough was largely flat, which ensured that trees, follies and water would play an important role in shaping the landscape.<ref name=\"Black 68\">Black, p. 68</ref> The grounds contain a number of [[Folly|follies]], many of which, such as The Chinese House and two Chinese-style bridges, have a [[chinoiserie|Chinese theme]], in honour of Admiral George Anson. Admiral Anson, who had visited [[Guangzhou|Canton]], left a considerable sum of money to his brother Thomas Anson when he died, which was used to develop the hall and estate.<ref name=\"Black 68\"/> The Chinese House and the red iron footbridge are both grade I listed.\n\nIn 1760, Classical architect [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]] was employed to design a number of monuments. Stuart had visited Athens in the early 1750s, and Ancient Greek influences are obvious at Shugborough. Staurt designed for Anson a copy of the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] and a grade I listed triumphal arch based on the [[Arch of Hadrian (Athens)|Arch of Hadrian]] in [[Athens]].<ref name=\"Black\">Black, p. 69</ref>\n\n====The Shepherd's Monument====\n{{further|Shugborough inscription}}\n[[Image:Shugborough inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Shugborough inscription]]]]\nThe Shepherd's Monument is a stone and [[marble]] folly within the grounds of Shugborough hall, engraved with the inscriptions ''\"O.U.O.S.V.A.V.V\"'' and ''\"D.M.\"''. The monument has been internationally well-known since 1982, when the book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' drew attention to the mysterious [[Shugborough inscription]]. Carved by [[Peter Scheemakers]], theories have abounded, including some which suggest it may indicate the whereabouts of the [[Holy Grail]].<ref name=\"Belfield\">Belfield, p. 112</ref>\n\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nfile:Red Bridge and the Chinese House, Shugborough (geograph 3081592).jpg|The Chinese House\nfile:Doric Temple, Shugborough Hall.jpg|The Doric Temple\nfile:Shugborough shepherds monument.JPG|The Shepherd's Monument\nfile:Tower of the Winds (4824631378).jpg|The Tower of the Winds\nfile:Triumphal Arch at Shugborough (geograph 3625020).jpg|Arch of Hadrian\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grade I listed buildings in Staffordshire]]\n* [[Listed buildings in Colwich, Staffordshire]]\n\n==References and sources==\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/theshugboroughestate/EstateHistory.aspx|date=n.d.|publisher=Staffordshire County Council|title=A Brief History of Shugborough|accessdate=27 August 2014}}\n*{{cite book |last=Belfield |first=Richard |title=The Six Unsolved Ciphers: Inside the Mysterious Codes That Have Confounded the World's Greatest Cryptographers |publisher=Ulysses Press |location=CA, USA |date=2007 |isbn=9781569756287 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sixunsolvedciphe0000belf }}\n*{{cite book|title=Culture in Eighteenth-Century England: A Subject for Taste|last=Black|first=Jeremy|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|year=2007|isbn=9781852855345}}\n*{{cite book|title=National Trust Studies 1981|last=Jackson-Stops|first=Gervase|publisher=Sotheby Parke Bernet|year=1981|isbn=9780856671104}}\n*{{cite book|title=The public life of queen Victoria|url=https://archive.org/details/publiclifequeen01mcgigoog|last=McGilchrist|first=John|year=1868|publisher=Casser, Petter and Galpin|location=London}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/leisure/museums/|title=Museums|publisher=[[Staffordshire County Council]]|accessdate=13 November 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/Homepage.aspx|title=Shugborough: A complete working historic estate|date=n.d.|accessdate=27 August 2014}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/theshugboroughestate/MansionHousePrivateApartments.aspx|title=The Mansion House|date=n.d.|accessdate=27 August 2014|publisher=[[Staffordshire County Council]]}}\n*{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=John Martin|title=The Architecture of Northern England|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=9780333373965|location=London}}\n*{{cite web|title=Shugborough Revisited|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/theshugboroughestate/ShugboroughRevisited.aspx|date=n.d.|publisher=[[Staffordshire County Council]]|accessdate=28 August 2014}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Shugborough Hall}}\n*[http://www.shugborough.org.uk Shugborough Estate] - official site\n\n[[Category:Agricultural museums in England]]\n[[Category:Anson family]]\n[[Category:Country houses in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Farm museums in England]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed houses]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Living museums in England]]\n[[Category:National Trust properties in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Open-air museums in England]]\n[[Category:Borough of Stafford]]\n[[Category:Cannock Chase]]\n", "name_user": "Endlesspumpkin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:fixed some references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugborough_Hall"}
