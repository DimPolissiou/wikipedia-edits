In the early 1920s a few hundred Mountain Jewish families from Azerbaijan and [[Dagestan]] left for [[Israel]] and settled in [[Tel-Aviv]]. The next [[aliyah]] did not take place until the 1970s, after the ban on Jewish immigration to [[Israel]] was lifted (see: [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)]]). Between 1972 and 1978 around 3,000 people left Azerbaijan for Israel. 1970 was the demographic peak for Azerbaijani Jews after [[World War II]]; according to the census, 41,288 Jews resided in Azerbaijan that year.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nMany Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Azerbaijan settled in Tel-Aviv and [[Haifa]].

Mountain Jewish female from Guba.jpg|left|thumb|Jewish woman from Guba by [[Max Tilke]] (19th-century painting)]]\nDifferent theories have been brought forward regarding the origin of Mountain Jews and the exact date of their settlement in the [[Caucasus]]. The commonly accepted theory views Mountain Jews as early medieval immigrants from [[Persia]] and possibly the [[Byzantine Empire]] forced out by [[Islamic conquests]]. They settled in [[Caucasian Albania]], on the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] and interacted with the [[Kypchak]] Kaganate of [[Khazaria]], which lied to the north. It was through these early Jewish communities that the [[Khazars]] converted to [[Judaism]] making it their state religion.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nIn the following centuries, Mountain Jews are believed to have moved further north making way to mass migration of [[Oguz Turks]] into the region. Their increase in number was supported by a constant flow of Jews from Iran. In the late [[Middle Ages]] Jews from [[Gilan]] founded a settlement in Oguz. Throughout the medieval epoch Mountain Jews were establishing cultural and economic ties with other Jewish communities of the [[Mediterranean]]. Agriculture and fabric trade was their main occupation until Sovietization. Some families practiced [[polygamy]].<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/> In 1730, Huseyn Ali, the ruler of the [[Quba Khanate]] (then newly separated from the [[Safavid Empire]]), issued a decree according to which Jews could own property in the khanate.<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=18754 Azeri Jews: Centuries of coexistence in Azerbaijan] by Gabriel Lerner.

They speak a distinct dialect of the [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat language]] called [[Juhuri]] or Jud\u00e6o-Tat. The majority speaks more than one language, the second and/or third one most often being Azeri or Russian.\n\n==Ashkenazi Jews==\n{{main|Ashkenazi Jews}}\n{{see also|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic}}\n1811 is the year when the first [[Ashkenazi Jews]] settled in Baku, but their mass immigration to what is now Azerbaijan did not start until the 1870s. Their immigration was relatively steady leading them to outnumber the local Mountain Jewish community by 1910. They settled mostly in the booming oil-rich city of [[Baku]]. The [[Caspian-Black Sea Company]], one of the leading oil companies in the [[Russian Empire]], was established in Baku by the wealthy [[Rothschild family]] of German Jewish origin. Ashkenazi Jews continued immigrating to Azerbaijan until the late 1940s, with a number of them being [[World War II]] evacuees from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus who chose to stay in their country of refuge.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nAshkenazi Jews were particularly active in Azerbaijani politics. Dr. [[Yevsey Gindes]], a [[Kiev]] native, served as Minister of Health of the [[Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]] (1918\u20131920). Along with that, 6 of the [[26 Baku Commissars]] were Ashkenazi Jewish. In 1912 around one third of Baku's registered lawyers and physicians were Ashkenazi Jewish as well.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nThe post-1972 [[aliyah]] largely affected this subgroup of Azerbaijani Jews, as among all they were more exposed to emigration. This resulted in the decline of their number, making Mountain Jews the largest Jewish group of Azerbaijan by the mid-1990s. Today there are about 500 Ashkenazi Jews living in the country.<ref>[http://haqqin.az/news/78064 \u0412 \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0445\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0438]. ''Haqqin.az''. 18 August 2016.</ref>\n\nSimilar to many immigrant communities of the Czarist and Soviet eras in Azerbaijan, Ashkenazi Jews appear to be linguistically [[Russification|Russified]]. The majority of Ashkenazi Jews speak Russian as their first language with Azeri being spoken as the second. The number of Yiddish-speakers is unknown.\n\n==Other Jewish subgroups==\nIt is not clear whether local Jewish communities had established ties with Georgian Jews before the Czarist epoch, however by the 1910s the Georgian Jewish diaspora in Baku already accounted for its own educational club. Today there are a few hundreds of Georgian Jews living in Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nIn 1827 first groups of [[Jud\u00e6o-Aramaic]]-speaking Kurdish Jews started settling in Azerbaijan. In 1919\u20131939 a synagogue for Kurdish Jews functioned in Baku. After Sovietization the attitude of the [[Stalinist]] Soviet government towards them was somewhat unfavourable, and in 1951 all Kurdish Jews were deported from the [[Caucasus]].<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nKrymchaks, who nowadays number only 2,500 people worldwide, consequently remained in quite low numbers in Azerbaijan throughout the 20th century. There were only 41 of them in the country in 1989. Bukharian Jews numbered 88 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=7 |title=The All-Soviet Population Census of 1989: Azerbaijan |publisher=Demoscope.ru |accessdate=14 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DmrClqp?url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=7 |archivedate=26 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Gerim and Subbotniks==\n[[Gerim]] and [[Subbotniks]] were ethnic [[Russians]] from various parts of Russia who converted to Judaism primarily in the 1820s. In 1839\u20131841 the Czarist government expelled these communities to the newly conquered [[South Caucasus]], mainly to what is now Azerbaijan. Upon arriving here, they founded several settlements around [[Jalilabad]] (then called Astrakhan-Bazar), of which the largest one was [[Privolnoye, Azerbaijan]]. It later became the largest Judaistic Russian settlement in Russia. By the late Soviet epoch the overall number of Gerim and Subbotniks in Azerbaijan was 5,000. There were only around 200 of them left in 1997 (when the region was visited by a research group from [[Saint Petersburg]]) with many planning to move to Russia and leaving virtually no chance for further preservation of this unique community.<ref>[http://judaica.spb.ru/artcl/a2/Azer_r.shtml Brief Report on the Expedition to Azerbaijan in June 1997] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016054325/http://judaica.spb.ru/artcl/a2/Azer_r.shtml |date=16 October 2007 }} by V.Dymshits.

Today, Jews in Azerbaijan mainly consist of three distinct groups: [[Mountain Jews]], the most sizable and most ancient group; [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who settled in the area during the late 19th-early 20th centuries, and during [[World War II]]; and [[Georgian Jews]] who settled mainly in [[Baku]] during the early part of the 20th century.\n\n==Distribution==\nHistorically, Jews in Azerbaijan have been represented by various subgroups, mainly [[Mountain Jews]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]] and [[Georgian Jews]]. Azerbaijan at one point was or still is home to smaller communities of [[Krymchaks]], [[Kurdish Jews]] and [[Bukharian Jews]], as well [[Conversion to Judaism|Gerim (converts)]] and non-Jewish [[Judaism|Judaistic]] groups like [[Subbotniks]]. In those days, Jews used to live in and around the city of [[Shamakhi]] (mainly in the village of [[M\u00fcc\u00fc]]), but the community has been non-existent since the early 1920s.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/> In 2002, the total number of Jewish residents in Azerbaijan was 10,000 people with about 5,500 of them being Mountain Jews.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2004/0183/analit05.php Ethnic Composition of Azerbaijan According to the 1999 Census] by Arif Yunusov.

In the early 1920s a few hundred Mountain Jewish families from Azerbaijan and [[Dagestan]] left for [[Israel]] and settled in [[Tel-Aviv]]. The next [[aliyah]] did not take place until the 1970s, after the ban on Jewish immigration to [[Israel]] was lifted (see: [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)]]). Between 1972 and 1978 around 3,000 people left Azerbaijan for Israel. 1970 was the demographic peak for Azerbaijani Jews after [[World War II]]; according to the census, 41,288 Jews resided in Azerbaijan that year.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nMany Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Azerbaijan settled in Tel-Aviv and [[Haifa]]. There are relatively large communities of Mountain Jewish expatriates from Azerbaijan in New York City and [[Toronto]].\n\nA new Jewish synagogue, which became one of the biggest synagogues in Europe opened in Baku on 9 March 2003. There is also a [[Ohr Avner Chabad Day School (Baku)|Jewish school]], operating in Azerbaijan since 2003.

Mountain Jewish female from Guba.jpg|left|thumb|Jewish woman from Guba by [[Max Tilke]] (19th-century painting)]]\nDifferent theories have been brought forward regarding the origin of Mountain Jews and the exact date of their settlement in the [[Caucasus]]. The commonly accepted theory views Mountain Jews as early medieval immigrants from [[Persia]] and possibly the [[Byzantine Empire]] forced out by [[Islamic conquests]]. They settled in [[Caucasian Albania]], on the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] and interacted with the [[Kypchak]] Kaganate of [[Khazaria]], which lied to the north. It was through these early Jewish communities that the [[Khazars]] converted to [[Judaism]] making it their state religion.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nIn the following centuries, Mountain Jews are believed to have moved further north making way to mass migration of [[Oguz Turks]] into the region. Their increase in number was supported by a constant flow of Jews from Iran. In the late [[Middle Ages]] Jews from [[Gilan]] founded a settlement in Oguz. Throughout the medieval epoch Mountain Jews were establishing cultural and economic ties with other Jewish communities of the [[Mediterranean]]. Agriculture and fabric trade was their main occupation until Sovietization. Some families practiced [[polygamy]].<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/> In 1730, Huseyn Ali, the ruler of the [[Quba Khanate]] (then newly separated from the [[Safavid Empire]]), issued a decree according to which Jews could own property in the khanate.<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=18754 Azeri Jews: Centuries of coexistence in Azerbaijan] by Gabriel Lerner.

They speak a distinct dialect of the [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat language]] called [[Juhuri]] or Jud\u00e6o-Tat. The majority speaks more than one language, the second and/or third one most often being Azeri or Russian.\n\n==Ashkenazi Jews==\n{{main|Ashkenazi Jews}}\n{{see also|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic}}\n1811 is the year when the first [[Ashkenazi Jews]] settled in Baku, but their mass immigration to what is now Azerbaijan did not start until the 1870s. Their immigration was relatively steady leading them to outnumber the local Mountain Jewish community by 1910. They settled mostly in the booming oil-rich city of [[Baku]]. The [[Caspian-Black Sea Company]], one of the leading oil companies in the [[Russian Empire]], was established in Baku by the wealthy [[Rothschild family]] of German Jewish origin. Ashkenazi Jews continued immigrating to Azerbaijan until the late 1940s, with a number of them being [[World War II]] evacuees from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus who chose to stay in their country of refuge.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nAshkenazi Jews were particularly active in Azerbaijani politics. Dr. [[Yevsey Gindes]], a [[Kiev]] native, served as Minister of Health of the [[Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]] (1918\u20131920). Along with that, 6 of the [[26 Baku Commissars]] were Ashkenazi Jewish. In 1912 around one third of Baku's registered lawyers and physicians were Ashkenazi Jewish as well.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nThe post-1972 [[aliyah]] largely affected this subgroup of Azerbaijani Jews, as among all they were more exposed to emigration. This resulted in the decline of their number, making Mountain Jews the largest Jewish group of Azerbaijan by the mid-1990s. Today there are about 500 Ashkenazi Jews living in the country.<ref>[http://haqqin.az/news/78064 \u0412 \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0445\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0438]. ''Haqqin.az''. 18 August 2016.</ref>\n\nSimilar to many immigrant communities of the Czarist and Soviet eras in Azerbaijan, Ashkenazi Jews appear to be linguistically [[Russification|Russified]]. The majority of Ashkenazi Jews speak Russian as their first language with Azeri being spoken as the second. The number of Yiddish-speakers is unknown.\n\n==Other Jewish subgroups==\nIt is not clear whether local Jewish communities had established ties with Georgian Jews before the Czarist epoch, however by the 1910s the Georgian Jewish diaspora in Baku already accounted for its own educational club. Today there are a few hundreds of Georgian Jews living in Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nIn 1827 first groups of [[Jud\u00e6o-Aramaic]]-speaking Kurdish Jews started settling in Azerbaijan. In 1919\u20131939 a synagogue for Kurdish Jews functioned in Baku. After Sovietization the attitude of the [[Stalinist]] Soviet government towards them was somewhat unfavourable, and in 1951 all Kurdish Jews were deported from the [[Caucasus]].<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/>\n\nKrymchaks, who nowadays number only 2,500 people worldwide, consequently remained in quite low numbers in Azerbaijan throughout the 20th century. There were only 41 of them in the country in 1989. Bukharian Jews numbered 88 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=7 |title=The All-Soviet Population Census of 1989: Azerbaijan |publisher=Demoscope.ru |accessdate=14 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DmrClqp?url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=7 |archivedate=26 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Gerim and Subbotniks==\n[[Gerim]] and [[Subbotniks]] were ethnic [[Russians]] from various parts of Russia who converted to Judaism primarily in the 1820s. In 1839\u20131841 the Czarist government expelled these communities to the newly conquered [[South Caucasus]], mainly to what is now Azerbaijan. Upon arriving here, they founded several settlements around [[Jalilabad]] (then called Astrakhan-Bazar), of which the largest one was [[Privolnoye, Azerbaijan]]. It later became the largest Judaistic Russian settlement in Russia. By the late Soviet epoch the overall number of Gerim and Subbotniks in Azerbaijan was 5,000. There were only around 200 of them left in 1997 (when the region was visited by a research group from [[Saint Petersburg]]) with many planning to move to Russia and leaving virtually no chance for further preservation of this unique community.<ref>[http://judaica.spb.ru/artcl/a2/Azer_r.shtml Brief Report on the Expedition to Azerbaijan in June 1997] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016054325/http://judaica.spb.ru/artcl/a2/Azer_r.shtml |date=16 October 2007 }} by V.Dymshits.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, a [[yeshiva]] opened in Baku in 1994 and an [[Ohr Avner Chabad Day School]] was established in 1999. In 1994, Hebrew was studied at one state university and offered as a course choice in two secondary schools.<ref name=\"eleven-az\"/> On 31 May 2007, a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the Ohr Avner Chabad Centre for Jewish Studies took place in Baku.

Rubinstein, ''The Jews in Australia: A Thematic History'' (2 vols., 1991) and Suzanne D. Rutland, ''Edge of the Diaspora: Two Centuries of Jewish Settlement in Australia'' (2001; first ed. 1988). Each of these academic historians has written more concise general histories also, with Hilary L. Rubinstein's ''Chosen: The Jews in Australia'' (1987) being the first overall history of Australian Jewry, and described by Rabbi Raymond Apple as skilfully and stylishly weaving together the strands of the story of a colourful minority group and its interaction with general society. Rabbi John Simon Levi, co-author of ''Australian Genesis: Jewish Convicts and Settlers, 1788-1850'' (1974) has authored the magisterial biographical directory, ''These Are The Names: Jewish Lives in Australia, 1788-1860'' (2013). ''The Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal'' (started 1939) appears twice a year, published in Sydney and Melbourne respectively.  There are also a number of published monographs on aspects of Australian Jewish history, for a guide to which (as well as to Australian Jewish literature) Serge Liberman, ''A Bibliography of Australasian Judaica, 1788-2008'' (2011) is a distinguished reference work.\n\n===Colonial era===\nAustralian Jews never constituted more than 1% of the total colonial community.<ref name=\"judaica\">{{cite web|url=http://judaica.library.usyd.edu.au/histories/History.html|title=Brief History of Australian Jewry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409235452/http://judaica.library.usyd.edu.au/histories/History.html|archivedate=9 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Eight convicts [[penal transportation|transported]] to [[Botany Bay]] in 1788 aboard the [[First Fleet]] have been identified as Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/05/a-history-of-the-great-synagogue-sydney/|title=A history of the Great Synagogue, Sydney|last=|first=|date=|website=Oztorah.com|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> There were probably more, but exact numbers are not possible as the transportation records did not indicate a convict's religion. Over a thousand more people of Jewish descent are estimated to have been sent to Australia as convicts during the next 60 years.<ref name=\"naa\" /> Most of them came from London, were of working-class background and were male. Only 7% of Jewish convicts were female, compared to 15% for non-Jewish convicts.

This included Irish Catholics as well as Jews. Similarly, education in the new settlement was Anglican church-controlled until the 1840s.<ref name=\"Rutland\" />\n\nThe first move towards organisation in the community was the formation of a [[Chevra Kadisha]] (a Jewish burial society) in Sydney in 1817.<ref name=\"Rutland\" /> In 1820, the Reverend Dr. [[William Cowper (Archdeacon of Cumberland)|William Cowper]] allotted land for the establishment of a [[Bereavement in Judaism|Jewish cemetery]] in the right-hand corner of the then-Christian cemetery. The Jewish section was created to enable the burial of one Joel Joseph. During the next ten years there was no great increase in membership of the society, and its services were not called for more than once a year. The actual allocation of land for a consecrated Jewish cemetery was not approved until 1832.<ref>V.D.

About this period Mr. P. J. Cohen having offered the use of his house for the purpose, [[Jewish services|divine worship]] was performed for the first time in the colony according to the Hebrew form, and was continued regularly every [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and [[Jewish holiday|holiday]]. From some difference of opinion then existing among the members of this faith, divine service was also performed occasionally in a room hired by Messrs. A. Elias and James Simmons. In this condition everything in connection with their religion remained until the arrival of Rev. Aaron Levi, in the year 1830. He had been a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]], and, duly accredited, he succeeded in instilling into the minds of the congregation a taste for the religion of their fathers. A [[Sefer Torah]] [scroll of the Law] was purchased by subscription, divine service was more regularly conducted, and from this time may be dated the establishment of the Jewish religion in Sydney. In 1832 they formed themselves into a proper congregation, and appointed [[Joseph Barrow Montefiore]] as the first president.\"\n\nIn 1832, the first [[Jewish wedding]] in Australia was celebrated, the [[Ketubah|contracting]] parties being Moses Joseph and Rosetta Nathan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/jews |title = Jews | author = Suzanne D.

The condition of the Jewish community improved to such an extent that in 1844 the first [[synagogue]] was formed in York Street, Sydney using rented space,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/05/a-history-of-the-great-synagogue-sydney/|title=OzTorah  \u00bb Blog Archive   \u00bb A history of the Great Synagogue, Sydney|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref> which continued in use for more than thirty years.\n\nThe 1841 census shows that New South Wales Jewry accounted for 65.3% of the total Australian Jewish population, and 0.57% of the total Australian population.<ref name=\"judaica\" /> In 1848, there were 200 Jews in Victoria, and they formed the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society to provide assistance to those in need.<ref name=JCare> [https://www.jewishcare.org.au/page/about/our-history Jewish Care - Our history]</ref>\n\nAlthough the Jewish community was primarily [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], some [[Sephardi Jews]] also immigrated to Australia, and the community thrived during the mid-to-late 19th century. For some twenty years, there was a Sephardic congregation, and some Sephardi families occupied important communal positions. Gradually, however, the Sephardi population declined, and the congregation was disbanded in 1873.<ref name=jsource/>\n\nThe [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] of the 1850s attracted a wave of immigrants, and Jewish immigrants soon outnumbered native-born Jews. Initially, they settled in rural areas, but by the end of the 19th century the lack of Jewish communal connections and fear of assimilation led most Australian Jews in rural areas to relocate to the Jewish centres in cities. As a result, the rapidly growing community in Sydney needed larger facilities, and built the [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]], located on [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]], opposite [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], which was consecrated in 1878.<ref name=jsource/>\n\n[[File:Brisbane's First Synagogue.JPG|left|thumb|Brisbane's First Synagogue in the grounds of Samuel Davis's home on North Quay, 1930]]\nWhen [[Separation of Queensland|Queensland separated]] from New South Wales in 1859, Jewish people began to settle in Brisbane, forming the [[Brisbane Hebrew Congregation]] in 1865.

Jewish refugees from Russia and Poland began arriving in the 1890s, fleeing [[pogrom]]s in their native lands. This immigration wave led to a divide among urban Jewish communities. Most Jews in Sydney were from Western and Central Europe, and were largely secular. Meanwhile, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe settled in Melbourne, and were highly Orthodox. In addition, thousands of highly observant Jews immigrated from South Africa and settled in [[Perth]].<ref name=jsource/>[[File:St kilda synagogue.jpg|thumb|St Kilda Synagogue.]]Jews also began to assemble in [[Melbourne]], then in the [[Port Phillip District]] (now [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]).

Construction of a larger 600 seat synagogue at South Yarra commenced in March 1855. Other Jewish congregations were formed in [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]], and [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] (1853). The [[East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation]] split from the Bourke St congregation in 1857. The St Kilda Hebrew Congregation was formed in 1871, with the first services held in St Kilda Town Hall and the building of a permanent building in Charnwood Road, [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], commencing in 1872.<ref>[http://www.stkildashule.org/history/history.asp St Kilda Shule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913201527/http://www.stkildashule.org/history/history.asp |date=13 September 2009 }}</ref> Since the 1850s, Melbourne has had the largest Jewish population in the country. A religious court ([[Beth Din]]) was set up in Melbourne in 1866.\n\n===20th century===\nBy 1901 it is estimated there were over 15,000 Jews in Australia.<ref name=\"naa\"/> When Australia was founded as an independent country in 1901, some of the founders were Jewish. From the outset, Jews were treated as equal citizens with freedom to participate in economic and cultural life, and played an important role in their development. [[Anti-semitism]], which was common in contemporary Europe, was very rare in Australia.<ref name=jsource/>\n\nFollowing World War I, another stream of Jewish immigrants came, and when the [[Nazi]]s took power in Germany in 1933, many [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]] came to Australia. The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to the many Jews who wanted to come, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas for \"victims of oppression\". Some 7,000 Jews were able to take up the visas before the outbreak of World War II put an end to the program.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II Australia abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of large numbers of people from continental Europe. Large numbers of European Jews, survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], arrived in the country from [[displaced persons camp]]s, but there was an outbreak of antisemitism. For example, the [[Returned Services League]] and other groups published cartoons to encourage the government and the immigration Minister [[Arthur A. Calwell]] to stem the flow of Jewish immigrants.<ref name=Rutland/>\n\nOrganizations during WWII tried to help children affected by the war by bringing them to Australia but were only able to after the war ended. During WWII transportation for civilians was limited, so no Jewish orphans could be brought over even though the Australian government increased their allowance quota for orphaned children. After the war, the pre-war anti-Jewish refugee sentiment influenced the government's choice not to fund any Jewish immigration, saying it was the Jewish community's responsibility to bring over the refugees. This made it so sponsors and organizations were the ones to help fund the Jewish refugee's journey and settlement into the Australia Jewish community. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1938 to 1961 the Jewish population almost tripled in size from the 1933 population to 61,000 Jews living in Australia. Organizations during the war tried to bring over and place children affected by the war, but were only able to after the war ended. Two organizations assisting with the immigration, specifically of orphaned children were ''Save the Children\u2019s Scheme'' and the ''Jewish Welfare Guardian Scheme,'' who brought over a total of 317 orphaned Jewish children from Europe in the years after the war. The girls brought over were placed into orphanages, while the boys were placed into hostels, where they lived with other holocaust survivors. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Young Victims of the Nazi Regime|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4725-2711-0|editor-last=Gigliotti|editor-first=Simone|pages=71-85|editor-last2=Tempian|editor-first2=Monica}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940 there were 2,500 German and Austrian refugee internees including 1,750 Jewish Refugees, known as the [[HMT_Dunera|Dunera]] internees, were all immediately sent to an internment camp in Hay Australia.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Diva Zion Synagogue, Greenslopes.JPG|thumb|Givat Zion Synagogue, Greenslopes, Queensland.]]A large number of the new immigrants were observant Jews, and day-school attendance rose steadily. A new Sephardic community also emerged in the post-war period. Previously, [[Mizrahi Jews]] were generally not permitted to enter due to Australia's [[White Australia policy]]. However, following the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, a number of [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian Jews]] were allowed to enter. Over the following years, overtures from Jewish communities led the government to drop its previous stance on entry of Mizrahi Jews. By 1969, when [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi Jews]] were being persecuted, the government granted refugee status to Iraqi Jews who managed to reach Australia.<ref name=\"jsource\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, the Australian Jewish community was concerned by the rising intermarriage rate which impacted the numbers of Jews with bonds to the community. By the early 1980s, intermarriage again dropped to one of the lowest rates in the diaspora. The community was further bolstered by immigration from South Africa, and starting in 1989, from the former Soviet Union.<ref name=jsource/>\n\nThroughout the 20th century, many Jews served as elected officials. Among the positions held by a Jew were Mayor of Melbourne, Premier of [[South Australia]], Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Speaker of Parliament. Many Jewish elected officials simultaneously served as the heads of their ''kehillas''. However, the successful integration of Jews into Australian society led to a rise in assimilation. Intermarriage rates rose, synagogue attendance dropped, and many Jews stopped practicing [[Judaism]] altogether.

He was refused a license by then governor Darling in 1828, though in the following year he was permitted to hold approved performances in his Sydney Hotel. A record of the event is found in an entry in \"Sydney in 1848\", a work published in that year: \"In the late twenties His Excellency Sir R. Bourke granted Barnett Levy a license for dramatic performances, with a restriction that he should confine himself to the representation of such pieces only as had been licensed in England by the Lord Chamberlain.\"  Levy was at that time the owner of the original Royal Hotel in George Street; and he fitted up the saloon of that establishment as a theatre, where the first representations of the legitimate drama in the colony were given. The encouragement that this undertaking received induced the enterprising proprietor to enlarge his sphere of activity. He built a theatre called the Theatre Royal, which was opened in 1833, at a cost which almost bankrupted him.\n\n[[Isaac Nathan]], who emigrated to Australia in 1841, wrote the first Australian [[opera]], ''[[Don John of Austria (opera)|Don John of Austria]]'' to a libretto by Jacob Levi Montefiore.

He established the Tolarno Gallery in Melbourne's bohemian [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. This became a venue for exhibitions of Australian [[Modernism|Modernist]] [[avant garde]] art. His wife, Mirka Mora, became a prominent artist and remains so, today.

He was influential in the introduction of Bauhaus principles into visual art and design curricula in Australia.  E. P. Fox and Abbey Alston have achieved distinction.  Paintings by both these artists have been hung in the Melbourne National Gallery. In the Adelaide Gallery hangs a tribute to the memory of H.

However, there is a wide range of Orthodox congregations, including [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]], [[Chabad]] and Adass Israel congregations. There are also [[Sephardi]] congregations.\n\nThere had been short-lived efforts to establish [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregations as early as the 1890s. However, under the leadership of Ada Phillips, a sustained liberal congregation, Temple Beth Israel was established in [[Melbourne]]. Subsequently, another synagogue linked to the [[Reform Movement]], [[Emanuel Synagogue (Sydney, New South Wales)|Temple Emanuel]], was established in Sydney in 1938. Following these two congregations, a number of other Liberal synagogues have been founded in other cities.<ref>Rubinstein and Freeman, (Editors), \"A Time to Keep: The story of Temple Beth Israel: 1930 to 2005\" A Special publication of the Australian Jewish Historical Society, 2005.</ref>\n\nSince 1992 [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] (Masorti) services have been held as an alternative service usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney.

Each of these academic historians has written more concise general histories also, with Hilary L. Rubinstein's ''Chosen: The Jews in Australia'' (1987) being the first overall history of Australian Jewry, and described by Rabbi Raymond Apple as skilfully and stylishly weaving together the strands of the story of a colourful minority group and its interaction with general society. Rabbi John Simon Levi, co-author of ''Australian Genesis: Jewish Convicts and Settlers, 1788-1850'' (1974) has authored the magisterial biographical directory, ''These Are The Names: Jewish Lives in Australia, 1788-1860'' (2013). ''The Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal'' (started 1939) appears twice a year, published in Sydney and Melbourne respectively.  There are also a number of published monographs on aspects of Australian Jewish history, for a guide to which (as well as to Australian Jewish literature) Serge Liberman, ''A Bibliography of Australasian Judaica, 1788-2008'' (2011) is a distinguished reference work.\n\n===Colonial era===\nAustralian Jews never constituted more than 1% of the total colonial community.<ref name=\"judaica\">{{cite web|url=http://judaica.library.usyd.edu.au/histories/History.html|title=Brief History of Australian Jewry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409235452/http://judaica.library.usyd.edu.au/histories/History.html|archivedate=9 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Eight convicts [[penal transportation|transported]] to [[Botany Bay]] in 1788 aboard the [[First Fleet]] have been identified as Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/05/a-history-of-the-great-synagogue-sydney/|title=A history of the Great Synagogue, Sydney|last=|first=|date=|website=Oztorah.com|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> There were probably more, but exact numbers are not possible as the transportation records did not indicate a convict's religion.

The Jewish section was created to enable the burial of one Joel Joseph. During the next ten years there was no great increase in membership of the society, and its services were not called for more than once a year. The actual allocation of land for a consecrated Jewish cemetery was not approved until 1832.<ref>V.D.

About this period Mr. P. J. Cohen having offered the use of his house for the purpose, [[Jewish services|divine worship]] was performed for the first time in the colony according to the Hebrew form, and was continued regularly every [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and [[Jewish holiday|holiday]]. From some difference of opinion then existing among the members of this faith, divine service was also performed occasionally in a room hired by Messrs. A. Elias and James Simmons. In this condition everything in connection with their religion remained until the arrival of Rev. Aaron Levi, in the year 1830. He had been a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]], and, duly accredited, he succeeded in instilling into the minds of the congregation a taste for the religion of their fathers. A [[Sefer Torah]] [scroll of the Law] was purchased by subscription, divine service was more regularly conducted, and from this time may be dated the establishment of the Jewish religion in Sydney. In 1832 they formed themselves into a proper congregation, and appointed [[Joseph Barrow Montefiore]] as the first president.\"\n\nIn 1832, the first [[Jewish wedding]] in Australia was celebrated, the [[Ketubah|contracting]] parties being Moses Joseph and Rosetta Nathan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/jews |title = Jews | author = Suzanne D.

''[[Qahal|Kehillas]]'' (organized communities) began to be established in Sydney (1831) and [[Melbourne]] (1841). The condition of the Jewish community improved to such an extent that in 1844 the first [[synagogue]] was formed in York Street, Sydney using rented space,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/05/a-history-of-the-great-synagogue-sydney/|title=OzTorah  \u00bb Blog Archive   \u00bb A history of the Great Synagogue, Sydney|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref> which continued in use for more than thirty years.\n\nThe 1841 census shows that New South Wales Jewry accounted for 65.3% of the total Australian Jewish population, and 0.57% of the total Australian population.<ref name=\"judaica\" /> In 1848, there were 200 Jews in Victoria, and they formed the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society to provide assistance to those in need.<ref name=JCare> [https://www.jewishcare.org.au/page/about/our-history Jewish Care - Our history]</ref>\n\nAlthough the Jewish community was primarily [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], some [[Sephardi Jews]] also immigrated to Australia, and the community thrived during the mid-to-late 19th century. For some twenty years, there was a Sephardic congregation, and some Sephardi families occupied important communal positions. Gradually, however, the Sephardi population declined, and the congregation was disbanded in 1873.<ref name=jsource/>\n\nThe [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] of the 1850s attracted a wave of immigrants, and Jewish immigrants soon outnumbered native-born Jews. Initially, they settled in rural areas, but by the end of the 19th century the lack of Jewish communal connections and fear of assimilation led most Australian Jews in rural areas to relocate to the Jewish centres in cities. As a result, the rapidly growing community in Sydney needed larger facilities, and built the [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]], located on [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]], opposite [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], which was consecrated in 1878.<ref name=jsource/>\n\n[[File:Brisbane's First Synagogue.JPG|left|thumb|Brisbane's First Synagogue in the grounds of Samuel Davis's home on North Quay, 1930]]\nWhen [[Separation of Queensland|Queensland separated]] from New South Wales in 1859, Jewish people began to settle in Brisbane, forming the [[Brisbane Hebrew Congregation]] in 1865.

Jewish refugees from Russia and Poland began arriving in the 1890s, fleeing [[pogrom]]s in their native lands. This immigration wave led to a divide among urban Jewish communities. Most Jews in Sydney were from Western and Central Europe, and were largely secular. Meanwhile, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe settled in Melbourne, and were highly Orthodox. In addition, thousands of highly observant Jews immigrated from South Africa and settled in [[Perth]].<ref name=jsource/>[[File:St kilda synagogue.jpg|thumb|St Kilda Synagogue.]]Jews also began to assemble in [[Melbourne]], then in the [[Port Phillip District]] (now [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]).

Other Jewish congregations were formed in [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]], and [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] (1853). The [[East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation]] split from the Bourke St congregation in 1857.

From the outset, Jews were treated as equal citizens with freedom to participate in economic and cultural life, and played an important role in their development. [[Anti-semitism]], which was common in contemporary Europe, was very rare in Australia.<ref name=jsource/>\n\nFollowing World War I, another stream of Jewish immigrants came, and when the [[Nazi]]s took power in Germany in 1933, many [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]] came to Australia. The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to the many Jews who wanted to come, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas for \"victims of oppression\". Some 7,000 Jews were able to take up the visas before the outbreak of World War II put an end to the program.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II Australia abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of large numbers of people from continental Europe. Large numbers of European Jews, survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], arrived in the country from [[displaced persons camp]]s, but there was an outbreak of antisemitism. For example, the [[Returned Services League]] and other groups published cartoons to encourage the government and the immigration Minister [[Arthur A. Calwell]] to stem the flow of Jewish immigrants.<ref name=Rutland/>\n\nOrganizations during WWII tried to help children affected by the war by bringing them to Australia but were only able to after the war ended. During WWII transportation for civilians was limited, so no Jewish orphans could be brought over even though the Australian government increased their allowance quota for orphaned children. After the war, the pre-war anti-Jewish refugee sentiment influenced the government\u2019s choice not to fund any Jewish immigration, saying it was the Jewish community\u2019s responsibility to bring over the refugees. This made it so sponsors and organizations were the ones to help fund the Jewish refugee\u2019s journey and settlement into the Australia Jewish community. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1938 to 1961 the Jewish population almost tripled in size from the 1933 population to 61,000 Jews living in Australia. Organizations during the war tried to bring over and place children affected by the war, but were only able to after the war ended. Two organizations assisting with the immigration, specifically of orphaned children were ''Save the Children\u2019s Scheme'' and the ''Jewish Welfare Guardian Scheme,'' who brought over a total of 317 orphaned Jewish children from Europe in the years after the war. The girls brought over were placed into orphanages, while the boys were placed into hostels, where they lived with other holocaust survivors. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Young Victims of the Nazi Regime|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4725-2711-0|editor-last=Gigliotti|editor-first=Simone|pages=71-85|editor-last2=Tempian|editor-first2=Monica}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940 there were 2,500 German and Austrian refugee internees including 1,750 Jewish Refugees, known as the [[HMT_Dunera|Dunera]] internees, were all immediately sent to an internment camp in Hay Australia.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Diva Zion Synagogue, Greenslopes.JPG|thumb|Givat Zion Synagogue, Greenslopes, Queensland.]]A large number of the new immigrants were observant Jews, and day-school attendance rose steadily.

However, following the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, a number of [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian Jews]] were allowed to enter. Over the following years, overtures from Jewish communities led the government to drop its previous stance on entry of Mizrahi Jews. By 1969, when [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi Jews]] were being persecuted, the government granted refugee status to Iraqi Jews who managed to reach Australia.<ref name=\"jsource\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, the Australian Jewish community was concerned by the rising intermarriage rate which impacted the numbers of Jews with bonds to the community. By the early 1980s, intermarriage again dropped to one of the lowest rates in the diaspora. The community was further bolstered by immigration from South Africa, and starting in 1989, from the former Soviet Union.<ref name=jsource/>\n\nThroughout the 20th century, many Jews served as elected officials. Among the positions held by a Jew were Mayor of Melbourne, Premier of [[South Australia]], Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Speaker of Parliament. Many Jewish elected officials simultaneously served as the heads of their ''kehillas''. However, the successful integration of Jews into Australian society led to a rise in assimilation.

B. Montefiore gave an impetus to the progress of New South Wales. Jacob owned one of the largest sheep-runs in the colony, and founded and for many years acted as director of the [[Bank of Australasia]]. The close connection of these two with the colony is further evidenced by the township of Montefiore, New South Wales, which stands at the junction of the [[Bell River (New South Wales)|Bell]] and [[Macquarie River (New South Wales)|Macquarie River]]s in the Wellington valley. Joseph Montefiore was the first president of the first Jewish congregation formed in Sydney in 1832.\n\nV. L. Solomon of Adelaide is remembered for the useful work he achieved in exploring the vast northern territory of his colony, the interests of which he represented in Parliament. M. V. Lazarus of Bendigo, known as Bendigo Lazarus, also did much to open up new parts in the back country of Victoria. Nathaniel Levi, for many years urged the cultivation of [[beetroot]] for the production of sugar and spirits owed its brief existence as an industry to Levi's own interest in raw material for his distilling company. In his labours on behalf of this industry he published in 1870 a work of 250 pages on the value and adaptability of the sugar-beet. In Western Australia, the townships of [[Karridale, Western Australia|Karridale]] and [[Boyanup, Western Australia|Boyanup]] owe their existence to the enterprise of M. C. Davies, a large lumber merchant.\n\n==Arts and culture==\n[[File:Issac nathan.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Isaac Nathan]] c. 1820.<ref>[[National Library of Australia]] nla.pic-an2292675</ref> Artist unknown, probably one of [[Lord Byron]]'s portraitists.]]\n\nBarnett Levy founded an early theatre in Australia.  He was refused a license by then governor Darling in 1828, though in the following year he was permitted to hold approved performances in his Sydney Hotel. A record of the event is found in an entry in \"Sydney in 1848\", a work published in that year: \"In the late twenties His Excellency Sir R. Bourke granted Barnett Levy a license for dramatic performances, with a restriction that he should confine himself to the representation of such pieces only as had been licensed in England by the Lord Chamberlain.\"  Levy was at that time the owner of the original Royal Hotel in George Street; and he fitted up the saloon of that establishment as a theatre, where the first representations of the legitimate drama in the colony were given. The encouragement that this undertaking received induced the enterprising proprietor to enlarge his sphere of activity. He built a theatre called the Theatre Royal, which was opened in 1833, at a cost which almost bankrupted him.\n\n[[Isaac Nathan]], who emigrated to Australia in 1841, wrote the first Australian [[opera]], ''[[Don John of Austria (opera)|Don John of Austria]]'' to a libretto by Jacob Levi Montefiore. It premiered on 3 May 1847 at the [[Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney]].\n\nThere have been Jewish contributions to Australian visual arts. [[Georges Mora]], born Gunter Morawski in 1913 in [[Leipzig, Germany]] of [[Jewish]]/[[Poles|Polish]] heritage,  fled Germany to Paris in 1930, then to Melbourne in 1949. He established the Tolarno Gallery in Melbourne's bohemian [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. This became a venue for exhibitions of Australian [[Modernism|Modernist]] [[avant garde]] art. His wife, Mirka Mora, became a prominent artist and remains so, today.  Printmaker and projection artist [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]] graduate and professor of the [[Bauhaus]] was deported to Australia as an \"enemy alien\" on the ship HMT Dunera, spending time in internment camps in Hay, Orange and Tatura, before being sponsored for Australian citizenship by [[James Ralph Darling|(Sir) James Darling]], headmaster of [[Geelong Church of England Grammar School]]. He was influential in the introduction of Bauhaus principles into visual art and design curricula in Australia.  E. P. Fox and Abbey Alston have achieved distinction.  Paintings by both these artists have been hung in the Melbourne National Gallery. In the Adelaide Gallery hangs a tribute to the memory of H. Abrahams for the services he rendered to the progress of art in Australia. Two Jews of Australian birth have attained to some distinction as writers, S. Alexander and Joseph Jacobs.\n\nThere has always been a thriving [[Australian Jewish Media|Australian Jewish media]] sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macroscope.com.au/|title=Macroscope \u2013 Human Intelligence|website=Macroscope.com.au|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> From the Australian Jewish news<ref>{{cite web|url=http://galusaustralis.com/tag/ajn/|title=The Australian Jewish News  -  Galus Australis - Jewish Life in Australia|website=Galusaustralis.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> - Australia's largest, and longest running hard copy publication, to radio shows,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mazeltovcocktailpodcast.podomatic.com/|title=Mazel Tov Cocktail|website=Mazeltovcocktailpodcast.podomatic.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> online magazines,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishwomenofwords.com.au/|title=Jewish Women of Words|website=Jewish Women of Words|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kvetchr.com|title=Kvetchr \u2013 Too Jewish!|website=Kvetchr.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> periodicals, and blogs,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sensiblejew.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518145754/http://sensiblejew.com/ |archive-date=18 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jewish Australians have been dedicated contributors to media intended for internal communal consumption,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishwomenofwords.com.au/jewish-words/exile-never-felt-so-good/|title=Exile Never Felt So Good|date=11 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> as well as the wider Australian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plus61j.net.au/|title=Home - +61J|website=Plus61j.net.au|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2004, art collector and dealer, [[Joseph Brown (artist)|Joseph Brown]], donated his substantial collection of Australian art of the 20th century to the National Gallery of Victoria.

Jews have been active contributors in science, art, and literature, and in the government of the colonial and Commonwealth eras, with a number attaining prominent public offices, including several governors-general. Despite this tolerant ethos, Australia rejected a Jewish refugee [[Kimberley Plan|resettlement proposal]], during World War II.\n\nPost-war Jewish immigration came at a time when antisemitism was rife, with the [[Returned Services League]] publishing cartoons to encourage the government and Immigration Minister [[Arthur A.

However, there is a wide range of Orthodox congregations, including [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]], [[Chabad]] and Adass Israel congregations. There are also [[Sephardi]] congregations.\n\nThere had been short-lived efforts to establish [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregations as early as the 1890s. However, under the leadership of Ada Phillips, a sustained liberal congregation, Temple Beth Israel was established in [[Melbourne]]. Subsequently, another synagogue linked to the [[Reform Movement]], [[Emanuel Synagogue (Sydney, New South Wales)|Temple Emanuel]], was established in Sydney in 1938. Following these two congregations, a number of other Liberal synagogues have been founded in other cities.<ref>Rubinstein and Freeman, (Editors), \"A Time to Keep: The story of Temple Beth Israel: 1930 to 2005\" A Special publication of the Australian Jewish Historical Society, 2005.</ref>\n\nSince 1992 [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] (Masorti) services have been held as an alternative service usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney.

{"title_page": "History of the Jews in Asti", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''[[Asti]]''' is a city of about 75,000 inhabitants located in the [[Piedmont]] region of northwestern Italy, about 55 kilometres (34 miles) east of [[Turin]], in the plain of the [[Tanaro River]]. It is the capital of the [[province of Asti]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was an important trade center and the capital of a powerful republic. Though it is believed{{who|date=May 2017}} that Asti's  Jewish community existed as early as the 8th century, it became prominent in the area in the 14th century with the arrival of many Jews expelled from France. As a result, the Jews of [[Asti]] (with the Jews of [[Moncalvo]] and [[Fossano]]) had their own Jewish ritual rite called APAM and spoke a local dialect of Piedmontese Hebrew.<ref>[[:it:Comunit\u00e0 ebraica di Asti]]</ref> The Jewish synagogue and cemetery in Asti can still be visited today, as well as the old [[ghetto]], a local Jewish museum and some of the old Jewish homes. Nowadays, however, the Jewish community of Asti consists of only several Jews, and is branched to the [[History of the Jews in Turin|Jewish community of Torino]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle ages===\nThe first documentation of Jews in [[Asti]] dates back to 812, when the phrase \"terra Judeo\" is mentioned in a document regarding the town, but the authenticity is questionable. It is not until the 14th century that there is evidence of a meaningful Jewish presence.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Asti |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/asti |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Renaissance===\nThe Jewish community of [[Asti]] had enlarged significantly due to the 1322 expulsion of the French Jews by king [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]].\n\nIn 1469, a local Jew named Perutio is mentioned as a resident of the city. He is mentioned in a context of a business trip to [[Pavia]]. Another Jew is mentioned between 1471\u20131472, requesting refuge in Asti due to a plague that happened in nearby Alexandria. During these years, the city council requested the [[duke of Orleans]], the ruler of the area, to expel the town Jews. The duke refused, though the Jews obligation to wear a [[yellow badge]] did remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.tau.ac.il/omeka/italjuda/items/show/1086|title=Asolo|publisher=Tau.ac.il|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> In 1515, the Jews named Clement and Solomon sons of Moses, were granted permission to reside in Asti thanks to the privileges given to the Jews of the entire area by its ruler [[Maximilian Sforza]].\n\nAfter the town was given in 1530 to the [[Duchy of Savoy]], its ruler [[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy]] ordered the expulsion of all Jews living in the town and its surroundings. Jews were readmitted to the town after her death, allowing them to practice loans. And many Jews did practice money lending, such as Isaac and Jacob Puget and Elijah from Nice who opened two loan banks in Asti after they were granted permission to do so. The rulers of Asti and Savoy had a strong interest in maintaining the Jewish money lending businesses since the latter paid fees for licensing and other grants to the rulers. In 1565, two money lending businesses were active in Asti, by the three Jews mentioned earlier. Prohibitions and regulations by the rulers made it illegal and impossible to open any other money lending business without the agreement of the two businesses approval. By the second half of the 16th century, the Asti bank businesses had already owned local banks in other towns such as [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Crescentino]] and [[Chieri]].

It is the capital of the [[province of Asti]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was an important trade center and the capital of a powerful republic. Though it is believed{{who|date=May 2017}} that Asti's  Jewish community existed as early as the 8th century, it became prominent in the area in the 14th century with the arrival of many Jews expelled from France. As a result, the Jews of [[Asti]] (with the Jews of [[Moncalvo]] and [[Fossano]]) had their own Jewish ritual rite called APAM and spoke a local dialect of Piedmontese Hebrew.<ref>[[:it:Comunit\u00e0 ebraica di Asti]]</ref> The Jewish synagogue and cemetery in Asti can still be visited today, as well as the old [[ghetto]], a local Jewish museum and some of the old Jewish homes. Nowadays, however, the Jewish community of Asti consists of only several Jews, and is branched to the [[History of the Jews in Turin|Jewish community of Torino]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle ages===\nThe first documentation of Jews in [[Asti]] dates back to 812, when the phrase \"terra Judeo\" is mentioned in a document regarding the town, but the authenticity is questionable. It is not until the 14th century that there is evidence of a meaningful Jewish presence.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Asti |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/asti |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Renaissance===\nThe Jewish community of [[Asti]] had enlarged significantly due to the 1322 expulsion of the French Jews by king [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]].\n\nIn 1469, a local Jew named Perutio is mentioned as a resident of the city. He is mentioned in a context of a business trip to [[Pavia]]. Another Jew is mentioned between 1471-1472, requesting refuge in Asti due to a plague that happened in nearby Alexandria. During these years, the city council requested the [[duke of Orleans]], the ruler of the area, to expel the town Jews. The duke refused, though the Jews obligation to wear a [[yellow badge]] did remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.tau.ac.il/omeka/italjuda/items/show/1086|title=Asolo|publisher=Tau.ac.il|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> In 1515, the Jews named Clement and Solomon sons of Moses, were granted permission to reside in Asti thanks to the privileges given to the Jews of the entire area by its ruler [[Maximilian Sforza]].\n\nAfter the town was given in 1530 to the [[Duchy of Savoy]], its ruler [[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy]] ordered the expulsion of all Jews living in the town and its surroundings. Jews were readmitted to the town after her death, allowing them to practice loans. And many Jews did practice money lending, such as Isaac and Jacob Puget and Elijah from Nice who opened two loan banks in Asti after they were granted permission to do so. The rulers of Asti and Savoy had a strong interest in maintaining the Jewish money lending businesses since the latter paid fees for licensing and other grants to the rulers. In 1565, two money lending businesses were active in Asti, by the three Jews mentioned earlier. Prohibitions and regulations by the rulers made it illegal and impossible to open any other money lending business without the agreement of the two businesses approval. By the second half of the 16th century, the Asti bank businesses had already owned local banks in other towns such as [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Crescentino]] and [[Chieri]]. By 1597, two other banks were also active in Asti, owned by Puges Moses and Abraham Concio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.tau.ac.il/omeka/italjuda/items/show/920#_ftn2|title=Asti|publisher=Tau.ac.il|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==The Ghetto==\nThe [[Jewish Ghetto]] was formally established in the third decade of the 18th century, as a result of the 1723 constitution of Savoy.

Shortly after, Boso passed his rights over the Jews of Arles to the local Archbishop named Rostang, as a gratitude for the clergy support of him. Boso's successors continued with this tradition.
