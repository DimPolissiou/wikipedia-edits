The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and began aiming for a career in [[Formula One]] four years later. He achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in Formula One with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and

racing driver who won the [[2016 Formula One World Championship]] driving for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport]]. The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and began aiming for a career in [[Formula One]] four years later. He achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in Formula One with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and

He is married to Daphne and they have three children. Volker Heine is considered a pioneer of theoretical and computational studies of the [[electronic structure]] of solids and liquids and  the determination of physical properties derived from it.\n\n==Biography==\nVolker Heine was educated at [[Wanganui Collegiate School]] and the [[University of Otago]] (New Zealand). In 1954, he came to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (UK) on a Shell Post-Graduate Scholarship to do his Ph.D. in physics (1956) as student of [[Nevill Francis Mott|Sir Nevill Mott]]. In the following years he obtained a Fellowship at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] and became part of the new theory group in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] and apart from a post-doc year and several sabbaticals and summer visits in the US, he stayed in Cambridge for the remainder of his career. In 1976, Heine became a professor and took over as head of the theory group which was by then called \"Theory of Condensed Matter\". He held that position until his retirement in 1997.<ref>[http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/about/history/ \"History of TCM'] retrieved 7 August 2016</ref>\n\nVolker Heine has been a very active figure in the international scientific community, shaping in particular the landscape of the field of atomistic computer simulations in Europe. He initiated and later led the Psi-k network,<ref>http://psi-k.net/</ref> a worldwide network of researchers working on the advancement of first-principles computational materials science. Psi-k's mission is to develop fundamental theory, algorithms, and computer codes in order to understand, predict, and design materials properties and functions. Key activities of Psi-k are the organization of conferences, workshops, tutorials and training schools as well as the dissemination of scientific thinking in society.\n\nVolker Heine was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974 and of the American Physical Society in 1987. He was awarded the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] in 1972, the [[Royal Medal]] of the Royal Society (London) in 1993, the [[Dirac Medal]] of the Institute of Physics in 1994, and the [[Max Born Prize]] in 2001. He has been visiting professor at several universities around the world and External Scientific Member of the [[Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research]] in Stuttgart.\n\n==Research==\nVolker Heine's research essentially covered three areas: (a) Understanding the behavior of materials from the calculation of their electronic structure; (b) Understanding the origin of incommensurately modulated materials; (c) Understanding the structure and properties of minerals from an atomic point of view. His main research topic is [[electronic structure]] theory and particularly the development of various fundamental concepts for condensed matter physics.

He is married to Daphne and they have three children. Volker Heine is considered a pioneer of theoretical and computational studies of the [[electronic structure]] of solids and liquids and  the determination of physical properties derived from it.\n\n==Biography==\nVolker Heine was educated at [[Wanganui Collegiate School]] and the [[University of Otago]] (New Zealand). In 1954, he came to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (UK) on a Shell Post-Graduate Scholarship to do his Ph.D. in physics (1956) as student of [[Nevill Francis Mott|Sir Nevill Mott]]. In the following years he obtained a Fellowship at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] and became part of the new theory group in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] and apart from a post-doc year and several sabbaticals and summer visits in the US, he stayed in Cambridge for the remainder of his career. In 1976, Heine became a professor and took over as head of the theory group which was by then called \"Theory of Condensed Matter\". He held that position until his retirement in 1997.<ref>[http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/about/history/ \"History of TCM'] retrieved 7 August 2016</ref>\n\nVolker Heine has been a very active figure in the international scientific community, shaping in particular the landscape of the field of atomistic computer simulations in Europe. He initiated and later led the Psi-k network,<ref>http://psi-k.net/</ref> a worldwide network of researchers working on the advancement of first-principles computational materials science. Psi-k's mission is to develop fundamental theory, algorithms, and computer codes in order to understand, predict, and design materials properties and functions. Key activities of Psi-k are the organization of conferences, workshops, tutorials and training schools as well as the dissemination of scientific thinking in society.\n\nVolker Heine was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974 and of the American Physical Society in 1987. He was awarded the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] in 1972, the [[Royal Medal]] of the Royal Society (London) in 1993, the [[Dirac Medal]] of the Institute of Physics in 1994, and the [[Max Born Prize]] in 2001. He has been visiting professor at several universities around the world and External Scientific Member of the [[Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research]] in Stuttgart.\n\n==Research==\nVolker Heine's research essentially covered three areas: (a) Understanding the behavior of materials from the calculation of their electronic structure; (b) Understanding the origin of incommensurately modulated materials; (c) Understanding the structure and properties of minerals from an atomic point of view. His main research topic is [[electronic structure]] theory and particularly the development of various fundamental concepts for condensed matter physics.

A single NAND chip is relatively slow, due to the narrow (8/16&nbsp;bit) [[asynchronous I/O]] interface, and additional high latency of basic I/O operations (typical for SLC NAND, ~25&nbsp;[[microsecond|\u03bcs]] to fetch a 4&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] page from the array to the I/O buffer on a read, ~250&nbsp;\u03bcs to commit a 4&nbsp;KiB page from the IO buffer to the array on a write, ~2&nbsp;ms to erase a 256&nbsp;KiB block). When multiple NAND devices operate in parallel inside an SSD, the bandwidth scales, and the high latencies can be hidden, as long as enough outstanding operations are pending and the load is evenly distributed between devices.<ref name=\"SSD Anthology\"/>\n\nMicron and Intel initially made faster SSDs by implementing [[data striping]] (similar to [[RAID 0]]) and [[interleaved memory|interleaving]] in their architecture.

For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called [[wear leveling]] to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\n\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. The process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Relocating data increases [[write amplification]] and adds to the wear of flash memory. Designers seek to minimize both.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |title       = Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives\n |date        = 2011-02-18\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Arnd Bergmann\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007144837/http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |title       = LogFS\n |date        = 2007-05-15\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Jonathan Corbet\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215514/https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Memory===\n\n====Flash memory====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 30em; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0;\"\n|+ Comparison of architectures<ref>[http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ SLC and MLC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405082307/http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ |date=2013-04-05 }} SSD Festplatten.

Logical device interfaces define the command sets used by [[operating system]]s to communicate with SSDs and [[host bus adapter]]s (HBAs).\n\n=={{Anchor|CONFIGURATIONS}}Configurations==\nThe size and shape of any device is largely driven by the size and shape of the components used to make that device. Traditional HDDs and [[optical disc drive|optical drives]] are designed around the rotating [[hard disk drive platter|platter]](s) or [[optical disc]] along with the [[hard disk drive spindle|spindle motor]] inside. If an SSD is made up of various interconnected [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and an interface connector, then its shape is no longer limited to the shape of rotating media drives.

They would all connect to a common bus inside the chassis and connect outside the box with a single connector.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/><!-- page 2 -->\n\nFor general computer use, the 2.5-inch form factor (typically found in laptops) is the most popular.

Each has a number of different attributes which are optimized and adjusted to best meet the needs of particular users. Some of these characteristics include power consumption, performance, size, and reliability.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\">{{cite web |url=http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3053/~/the-differences-between-an-ssd-and-a-memory-card |title=The differences between an SSD and a memory card |publisher=sandisk.com |accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref>\n\nSSDs were originally designed for use in a computer system. The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as the [[M.2]] form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/>\n\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as [[Secure Digital]] (SD), [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/> There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer.{{citation needed |date=August 2019}} The typical [[CompactFlash]] card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\n\n== SSD failure ==\n\nSSDs have very different [[failure mode]]s than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.<ref name=\"2016study\">[http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/23105-fast16-papers-schroeder.pdf Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected] - Schroeder, Lagisetty & Merchant, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== SSD reliability and failure modes===\nAn early test by ''[[Techreport.com]]'' which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \"typical consumer\".<ref name=\"TR2015\">{{cite web|url=https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead|title=The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead|first=Geoff|last=Gasior|website=The Tech Report}}</ref> The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 [[petabyte]]s) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.<ref name=\"TR2015\"/> So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\n\nA 2016 study<ref name=\"2016study\" /> of \"millions of drive days\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, reported that \"4-10%\" of their SSDs were replaced in a 4-year period and concluded based upon annual failure rates of HDDs published in 2007 that SSDs fail at a \"significantly lower\" rate than HDDs; however a 2016 study of 71,940 HDDs (26 million drive days) reported annual failure rates comparable to the reported SSD rates, that is, the HDDs on the average had a calculated four year failure rate of 7.5% and with a lowest rate of 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/\n |title=Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018\n |last=Klein\n |first=Andy\n |date=January 19, 2019\n |website=\n |publisher=Backblaze\n |access-date=February 13, 2019\n |quote= The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for 2018 for all [hard disk] drive models was just 1.25%, well below the rates from previous years ...}}\nFour year rate calculated from published AFR.</ref>  The 2016 SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It also contained a number of \"unexpected conclusions\"\n\n* In the real world, [[Multi-level cell|MLC]] based designs - believed less reliable than [[Single-level cell|SLC]] designs - are often as reliable as SLC. (The findings state that \"SLC [is] not generally more reliable than MLC\")\n* Device age, measured by days in use, is the main factor in SSD reliability, and not amount of data read or written, which are measured by TBW or DWPD. Because this finding persists after controlling for early failure and other factors, it is likely that factors such as \"silicon aging\" is a cause of this trend. The correlation is significant (around 0.2 - 0.4).\n* Raw bit error rates (RBER) grows much slower than usually believed and is not exponential as often assumed, nor is it a good predictor of other errors or SSD failure.\n* The uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) is widely used but is not a good predictor of failure either. However SSD UBER rates are higher than those for HDDs, so although they do not predict failure, they can lead to data loss due to unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs. The conclusion states that although more reliable overall, the rate of uncorrectable errors able to impact a user is larger.\n* \"Bad blocks in new SSDs are common, and drives with a large number of bad blocks are much more likely to lose hundreds of other blocks, most likely due to die or chip failure. 30-80 percent of SSDs develop at least one bad block and 2-7 percent develop at least one bad chip in the first four years of deployment.\"\n* There is no sharp increase in errors after the expected lifetime is reached.\n* Most SSDs develop no more than a few bad blocks, perhaps 2 - 4. SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on to develop far more (perhaps hundreds), and may be prone to failure. However most drives (99%+) are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture. The finding overall was that bad blocks are common and 30-80% of drives will develop at least one in use, but even a few bad blocks (2 - 4) is a predictor of up to hundreds of bad blocks at a later time. The bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development of further bad blocks. The report conclusion added that SSDs tended to either have \"less than a handful\" of bad blocks or \"a large number\", and suggested that this might be a basis for predicting eventual failure.\n* Around 2-7% of SSDs will develop bad chips in their first 4 years of use. Over 2/3 of these chips will have breached their manufacturers' tolerances and specifications, which typically guarantee that no more than 2% of blocks on a chip will fail within its expected write lifetime.\n* 96% of those SSDs that need repair (warranty servicing), need repair only once in their life. Days between repair vary from \"a couple of thousand days\" to \"nearly 15,000 days\" depending on the model.\n\n===Data recovery and secure deletion===\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for [[data recovery]] companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\n\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as [[hdparm]] can be used for this purpose.\n\n===Endurance===\nThe ''[[JEDEC Solid State Technology Association]]'' (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:<ref name=\"NullLobur2014\">{{cite book|last1=Null|first1=Linda|last2=Lobur|first2=Julia|title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKgxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT499|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-15077-3|pages=499\u2013500}}</ref>\n* Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)\n* Terabytes Written (TBW) - The number of terabytes that can be written to a drive within its warranty.\n* Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) - The number of times the total capacity of the drive may be written to per day within its warranty.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to their generally prohibitive cost versus HDD's at the time, until 2009, SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of [[mission critical]] applications where the speed of the [[computer data storage|storage system]] needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. For instance, in the [[distributed computing]] environment, SSDs can be used as the building block for a [[distributed cache]] layer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to the slower HDD based backend storage system. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as distributed [[key-value database]] and distributed [[file system]]. On the supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to as [[burst buffer]]. With this fast layer, users often experience shorter system response time. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include [[equity securities#Trading|equity trading]] companies, [[telecommunication]] corporations, and [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose [[personal computer]] hardware. A [[write protection|write protected]] flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nSSDs based on an [[SD card]] with a [[live SD]] operating system are easily [[SD card#Optional write-protect tab|write-locked]]. Combined with a [[cloud computing]] environment or other writable medium, to maintain [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], an [[operating system|OS]] [[booting|booted]] from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\n\n===Hard drives caching===\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their [[Z68]] chipset (and mobile derivatives) called [[Smart Response Technology]], which allows a [[SATA]] SSD to be used as a [[cache (computing)|cache]] (configurable as write-through or [[write-back]]) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |title=Intel Z68 Chipset & Smart Response Technology (SSD Caching) Review |publisher=AnandTech |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222631/http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |archivedate=2012-05-05 }}</ref> A similar technology is available on [[HighPoint]]'s RocketHybrid [[PCIe]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rockethybrid-1220-ssd-caching,2936.html |title=SSD Caching (Without Z68): HighPoint's RocketHybrid 1220 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the [[magnetic storage]] by the host using [[ATA-8]] commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's [[ReadyDrive]] technology explicitly stores portions of the [[hibernation (computing)#Microsoft Windows|hibernation file]] in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.<ref name=\"RussinovichSolomon2009b\">{{cite book |author1=Mark E.

Examples of this type of system are [[bcache]] and [[dm-cache]] on [[Linux]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |title       = Advanced Hard Drive Caching Techniques\n |date        = 2013-11-25\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-02\n |author      = Petros Koutoupis\n |publisher   = linuxjournal.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202152028/http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |archivedate = 2013-12-02\n}}</ref> and Apple's [[Fusion Drive]].\n\n=={{anchor|Page alignment|Block alignment|Partition alignment}}File system support for SSDs==\n{{Main|List of file systems#File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media|l1=File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media}}\n\nTypically the same [[file system]]s used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the [[Trim (computing)|TRIM command]] which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage [[wear leveling]] or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using [[log-structured file system|log-based]] designs ([[F2FS]], [[JFFS2]]) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating [[file system#Metadata|file-system metadata]].\n\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to [[partition alignment|align partitions]] correctly, which avoids excessive [[read-modify-write]] cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1&nbsp;[[binary prefix|MiB]] (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1&nbsp;MiB, 512&nbsp;KiB, 128&nbsp;KiB, 4&nbsp;KiB, and 512&nbsp;B.

This leverages the performance offered by SSDs and [[NVM Express]], by allowing much higher I/O submission rates. With this new design of the Linux kernel block layer, internal queues are split into two levels (per-CPU and hardware-submission queues), thus removing bottlenecks and allowing much higher levels of I/O parallelization.

For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called [[wear leveling]] to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\n\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. The process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Relocating data increases [[write amplification]] and adds to the wear of flash memory.

If an SSD is made up of various interconnected [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and an interface connector, then its shape is no longer limited to the shape of rotating media drives.

It remains electrically compatible with the PCI Express Mini Card interface specification, while requiring an additional connection to the SATA host controller through the same connector.\n\n[[M.2]] form factor, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a natural transition from the mSATA and physical layout it used, to a more usable and more advanced form factor. While mSATA took advantage of an existing form factor and connector, M.2 has been designed to maximize usage of the card space, while minimizing the footprint.

The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as the [[M.2]] form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/>\n\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as [[Secure Digital]] (SD), [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/> There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer.{{citation needed |date=August 2019}} The typical [[CompactFlash]] card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\n\n== SSD failure ==\n\nSSDs have very different [[failure mode]]s than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.<ref name=\"2016study\">[http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/23105-fast16-papers-schroeder.pdf Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected] - Schroeder, Lagisetty & Merchant, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== SSD reliability and failure modes===\nAn early test by ''[[Techreport.com]]'' which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \"typical consumer\".<ref name=\"TR2015\">{{cite web|url=https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead|title=The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead|first=Geoff|last=Gasior|website=The Tech Report}}</ref> The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 [[petabyte]]s) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.<ref name=\"TR2015\"/> So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\n\nA 2016 study<ref name=\"2016study\" /> of \"millions of drive days\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, reported that \"4-10%\" of their SSDs were replaced in a 4-year period and concluded based upon annual failure rates of HDDs published in 2007 that SSDs fail at a \"significantly lower\" rate than HDDs; however a 2016 study of 71,940 HDDs (26 million drive days) reported annual failure rates comparable to the reported SSD rates, that is, the HDDs on the average had a calculated four year failure rate of 7.5% and with a lowest rate of 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/\n |title=Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018\n |last=Klein\n |first=Andy\n |date=January 19, 2019\n |website=\n |publisher=Backblaze\n |access-date=February 13, 2019\n |quote= The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for 2018 for all [hard disk] drive models was just 1.25%, well below the rates from previous years ...}}\nFour year rate calculated from published AFR.</ref>  The 2016 SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It also contained a number of \"unexpected conclusions\"\n\n* In the real world, [[Multi-level cell|MLC]] based designs - believed less reliable than [[Single-level cell|SLC]] designs - are often as reliable as SLC. (The findings state that \"SLC [is] not generally more reliable than MLC\")\n* Device age, measured by days in use, is the main factor in SSD reliability, and not amount of data read or written, which are measured by TBW or DWPD. Because this finding persists after controlling for early failure and other factors, it is likely that factors such as \"silicon aging\" is a cause of this trend. The correlation is significant (around 0.2 - 0.4).\n* Raw bit error rates (RBER) grows much slower than usually believed and is not exponential as often assumed, nor is it a good predictor of other errors or SSD failure.\n* The uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) is widely used but is not a good predictor of failure either. However SSD UBER rates are higher than those for HDDs, so although they do not predict failure, they can lead to data loss due to unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs. The conclusion states that although more reliable overall, the rate of uncorrectable errors able to impact a user is larger.\n* \"Bad blocks in new SSDs are common, and drives with a large number of bad blocks are much more likely to lose hundreds of other blocks, most likely due to die or chip failure. 30-80 percent of SSDs develop at least one bad block and 2-7 percent develop at least one bad chip in the first four years of deployment.\"\n* There is no sharp increase in errors after the expected lifetime is reached.\n* Most SSDs develop no more than a few bad blocks, perhaps 2 - 4. SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on to develop far more (perhaps hundreds), and may be prone to failure. However most drives (99%+) are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture. The finding overall was that bad blocks are common and 30-80% of drives will develop at least one in use, but even a few bad blocks (2 - 4) is a predictor of up to hundreds of bad blocks at a later time. The bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development of further bad blocks. The report conclusion added that SSDs tended to either have \"less than a handful\" of bad blocks or \"a large number\", and suggested that this might be a basis for predicting eventual failure.\n* Around 2-7% of SSDs will develop bad chips in their first 4 years of use. Over 2/3 of these chips will have breached their manufacturers' tolerances and specifications, which typically guarantee that no more than 2% of blocks on a chip will fail within its expected write lifetime.\n* 96% of those SSDs that need repair (warranty servicing), need repair only once in their life. Days between repair vary from \"a couple of thousand days\" to \"nearly 15,000 days\" depending on the model.\n\n===Data recovery and secure deletion===\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for [[data recovery]] companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\n\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as [[hdparm]] can be used for this purpose.\n\n===Endurance===\nThe ''[[JEDEC Solid State Technology Association]]'' (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:<ref name=\"NullLobur2014\">{{cite book|last1=Null|first1=Linda|last2=Lobur|first2=Julia|title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKgxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT499|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-15077-3|pages=499\u2013500}}</ref>\n* Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)\n* Terabytes Written (TBW) - The number of terabytes that can be written to a drive within its warranty.\n* Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) - The number of times the total capacity of the drive may be written to per day within its warranty.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to their generally prohibitive cost versus HDD's at the time, until 2009, SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of [[mission critical]] applications where the speed of the [[computer data storage|storage system]] needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. For instance, in the [[distributed computing]] environment, SSDs can be used as the building block for a [[distributed cache]] layer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to the slower HDD based backend storage system. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as distributed [[key-value database]] and distributed [[file system]]. On the supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to as [[burst buffer]]. With this fast layer, users often experience shorter system response time. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include [[equity securities#Trading|equity trading]] companies, [[telecommunication]] corporations, and [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose [[personal computer]] hardware. A [[write protection|write protected]] flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nSSDs based on an [[SD card]] with a [[live SD]] operating system are easily [[SD card#Optional write-protect tab|write-locked]]. Combined with a [[cloud computing]] environment or other writable medium, to maintain [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], an [[operating system|OS]] [[booting|booted]] from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\n\n===Hard drives caching===\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their [[Z68]] chipset (and mobile derivatives) called [[Smart Response Technology]], which allows a [[SATA]] SSD to be used as a [[cache (computing)|cache]] (configurable as write-through or [[write-back]]) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |title=Intel Z68 Chipset & Smart Response Technology (SSD Caching) Review |publisher=AnandTech |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222631/http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |archivedate=2012-05-05 }}</ref> A similar technology is available on [[HighPoint]]'s RocketHybrid [[PCIe]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rockethybrid-1220-ssd-caching,2936.html |title=SSD Caching (Without Z68): HighPoint's RocketHybrid 1220 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the [[magnetic storage]] by the host using [[ATA-8]] commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's [[ReadyDrive]] technology explicitly stores portions of the [[hibernation (computing)#Microsoft Windows|hibernation file]] in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.<ref name=\"RussinovichSolomon2009b\">{{cite book |author1=Mark E.

Examples of this type of system are [[bcache]] and [[dm-cache]] on [[Linux]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |title       = Advanced Hard Drive Caching Techniques\n |date        = 2013-11-25\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-02\n |author      = Petros Koutoupis\n |publisher   = linuxjournal.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202152028/http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |archivedate = 2013-12-02\n}}</ref> and Apple's [[Fusion Drive]].\n\n=={{anchor|Page alignment|Block alignment|Partition alignment}}File system support for SSDs==\n{{Main|List of file systems#File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media|l1=File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media}}\n\nTypically the same [[file system]]s used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the [[Trim (computing)|TRIM command]] which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage [[wear leveling]] or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using [[log-structured file system|log-based]] designs ([[F2FS]], [[JFFS2]]) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating [[file system#Metadata|file-system metadata]].\n\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to [[partition alignment|align partitions]] correctly, which avoids excessive [[read-modify-write]] cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1&nbsp;[[binary prefix|MiB]] (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1&nbsp;MiB, 512&nbsp;KiB, 128&nbsp;KiB, 4&nbsp;KiB, and 512&nbsp;B. Modern operating system installation software and disk tools handle this automatically.\n\n==={{Anchor|FSTRIM|QUEUED-TRIM}}Linux===\nThe [[ext4]], [[Btrfs]], [[XFS]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], and [[F2FS]] file systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function.\n\nKernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on {{date|2010-02-24}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |title       = Linux kernel 2.6.33\n |date        = 2010-02-24\n |accessdate  = 2013-11-05\n |website     = kernelnewbies.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616025132/http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |archivedate = 2012-06-16\n}}</ref> To make use of it, a file system must be mounted using the <code>discard</code> parameter.

The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[multiplayer]] game in which players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperate]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nThe game was first conceptualized in 2014. Rare was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. It also became the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) Microsoft have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

Designer Mike Chapman believed a lot of parallels can be drawn between ''Sea of Thieves'' and ''[[The Goonies]]'', in which a group of friends bond together while they search for treasure, creating a journey that all of them would fondly remember.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Neate added that the game's goal was to evoke \"[a] sense of travel and exploration and discovery\".<ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|title=Sea of Thieves\u2019 lore is surprisingly deep, silly and refreshing|first=Cass|last=Marshall|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324135017/https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The team implemented the \"infinite pirate generator\" instead of allowing players to customize their avatar as they feared that some players would create \"abominations\" that would not have fit the game's visual style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|title=How Rare designed Sea of Thieves' infinite pirate generator|first=Jack|last=Yarwood|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324135011/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The game features a stylized visual style with hand-painted textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|title=Visual Adventures on 'Sea of Thieves'|work=GDC Vault|first=Ryan|last=Stevenson|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325071952/https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|archive-date=25 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Duncan added that the team chose this painted art style because they wanted it to be \"timeless\" and reflect the  \"joyful\" and \"delightful\" game world.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\n===Gameplay design===\n\nRare noticed that in many multiplayer games, experienced players would focus on grinding for endgame content instead of playing with other players, while novice players would worry about their progression lagging significantly behind more experienced players. Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324135100/https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently. Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ship every 15 minutes to half an hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324125038/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]]. Players need to exercise their [[common sense]] in order to solve the challenges: for instance, players need to learn to read maps. To encourage players to develop these skills, the game does not feature a beginner's [[tutorial]] as the team wanted players to discover the game's mechanics by themselves.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team also intentionally avoided setting gameplay rules to encourage players to utilize their creativity.<ref name=\"solo play\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/when-we-made-sea-of-thieves/|title=When We Made\u2026 Sea of Thieves|first=Marie|last=Dealessandri|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Despite this, Rare also included [[emergent gameplay]] in a more systemic manner by introducing shipwrecks and fonts that players can discover. Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other.

Thieves''''' is a 2018 [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[multiplayer]] game in which players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperate]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nThe game was first conceptualized in 2014. Rare was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. It also became the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) Microsoft have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

The team looked at various sources for inspiration, including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[Black Sails (TV series)|Black Sails]]''.

Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324135100/https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently. Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ship every 15 minutes to half an hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324125038/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]]. Players need to exercise their [[common sense]] in order to solve the challenges: for instance, players need to learn to read maps. To encourage players to develop these skills, the game does not feature a beginner's [[tutorial]] as the team wanted players to discover the game's mechanics by themselves.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team also intentionally avoided setting gameplay rules to encourage players to utilize their creativity.<ref name=\"solo play\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/when-we-made-sea-of-thieves/|title=When We Made\u2026 Sea of Thieves|first=Marie|last=Dealessandri|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Despite this, Rare also included [[emergent gameplay]] in a more systemic manner by introducing shipwrecks and fonts that players can discover. Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other.
