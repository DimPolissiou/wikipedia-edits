Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content.\n\nThe first DVD player was created by Sony Corporation in Japan in collaboration with Pacific Digital Company from the United States in 1997.{{fact|date=August 2015}} Some manufacturers originally announced that DVD players would be available as early as the middle of 1996. These predictions were too optimistic. Delivery was initially held up for \"political\" reasons of copy protection demanded by movie studios, but was later delayed by lack of movie titles. The first players appeared in Japan on November 1, 1996, followed by the United States on March 19, 1997 (a few days earlier than the DVD-Video launch there) with distribution limited to only seven major cities for the first six months.\n\nPlayers slowly trickled into other regions around the world. Prices for the first players in 1997 started at $600 and could top out at prices over a gay price of $1000. By the end of 2000, players were available for under $100 at discount retailers. In 2003 players became available for under $50. Six years after the initial launch, close to one thousand models of DVD players were available from over a hundred consumer electronics manufacturers.\n\nFujitsu released the first DVD-ROM-equipped computer on November 6 in Great Britain. Toshiba released a DVD-ROM-equipped computer and a DVD-ROM drive in Japan in early 1997 (moved back from December which was moved back from November). DVD-ROM drives from Toshiba, Pioneer, Panasonic, Hitachi, and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997, but none were available before May. The first PC upgrade kits (a combination of DVD-ROM drive and hardware decoder card) became available from Creative Labs, Hi-Val, and Diamond Multimedia in April and May 1997. In 2014, every major PC manufacturer has models that include DVD-ROM drives.\n\nThe first DVD-Audio players were released in Japan by Pioneer in late 1999, but they did not play copy-protected discs. Matsushita (under the Panasonic and Technics labels) first released full-fledged players in July 2000 for $700 to $1,200. DVD-Audio players are now also made by Aiwa, Denon, JVC, Kenwood, Madrigal, Marantz, Nakamichi, Onkyo, Toshiba, Yamaha, and others. Sony released the first SACD players in May 1999 for $5,000. Pioneer's first DVD-Audio players released in late 1999 also played SACD. SACD players are now also made by Accuphase, Aiwa, Denon, Kenwood, Marantz, Philips, Sharp, and others.\n\n== Technical details ==\n[[File:DK Digital DVD 1080 open.jpg|thumb|The interior of a DVD player]]\n\nA DVD player has to complete these tasks:\n*Read a [[DVD]] in ISO \u2013 [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] version 1.02 format\n*Optionally decrypt the data with either [[Content-scrambling system|CSS]] and/or [[Macrovision]]\n*Read and obey the DVDs [[Regional lockout]] codes and display a warning if the player is not authorized to play the DVD\n*Decode the [[MPEG-2]] video stream with a maximum of 10 Mbit/s (peak) or 8 Mbit/s (continuous)\n*Decode sound in [[MP2 (format)|MP2]], [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] or [[Dolby AC-3|AC-3]] format and output (with optional AC-3 to stereo downmixing) on stereo connector, optical or electric digital connector\n*Output a video signal, either an analog one (in [[NTSC]] or [[PAL]] format) on the [[composite video|composite]], [[S-Video]], [[SCART]], or [[component video]] connectors, or a digital one on the [[Digital visual interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] connectors.\n*DVD players cannot play [[Blu-ray]] discs due to using different wavelength laser's Blu ray use a Blue Violet laser instead of a Red laser. However, all Blu-ray players are \"backwards compatible\" and they will play DVDs and some are compatible with [[Compact Disc|CD]] and other disc formats.\n\n== CD/DVD/AVI/MP4 playback ==\nAdditionally, most DVD players allow users to play audio [[compact disc|CD]]s ([[CD-DA]], [[MP3]], etc.) and [[Video CD]]s ([[VCD]]). A few include a [[home cinema]] decoder (i.e. [[Dolby Digital]], [[Digital Theater Systems]] (DTS)). Some newer devices also play videos in the [[Advanced Simple Profile|MPEG-4 ASP]] video compression format (such as [[DivX]]) popular in the Internet.\n\n== Portable players ==\n{{See also|Portable DVD player}}\n[[File:Portable DVD player.jpg|thumb|A portable DVD player]]\nMost hardware DVD players must be connected to a [[television]]; there are portable devices which have an attached [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen and stereo speakers. Portable DVD players are often used for long road trips and travel. They often have a plug for the 12 volt power jack in cars. Some models have two screens, so that two people in the back seat can both watch the movie. Other portable DVD players have a single screen that opens up like a laptop computer screen.\n\n== Output ==\n[[File:DVD player output.jpg|thumb|right|Output]]\nDue to multiple audio (and video) output devices, there are many outputs on a DVD player, such as an RCA jack, component outputs, and an HDMI output. Consumers may become confused with how to connect a player to a TV or amplifier. Most systems include an optional digital audio connector for this task, which is then paired with a similar input on the amplifier. The physical connection is typically [[RCA connector]]s or [[TOSLINK]], which transmits a [[S/PDIF]] stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio (PCM) or the original compressed audio data (Dolby Digital, DTS, MPEG audio) to be decoded by the audio equipment.\n\n=== Video ===\nVideo is another issue which continues to present most problems. Early generations of DVD players usually outputted [[analog signal|analog]] video only, via both [[composite video]] on an RCA jack and [[S-Video]]. However, neither connector was intended to be used for [[progressive video]], and most later players sold then gained another set of connectors, [[component video]], which keeps the three components of the video, luminance and two color differentials, on fully separate wires. This video information is taken directly from the DVD itself.  The three components compare well to S-Video, which uses two wires, uniting and degrading the two color signals, and composite, which uses only wire one, uniting and degrading all three signals.\n\nThe connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models, RCA or [[BNC connector|BNC]], as well as using [[VGA connector|VGA]] cables in a non-standard way (VGA is normally analog [[RGB color model|RGB]]&mdash;a different, incompatible form of component video). Even worse, there are often two sets of component outputs, one carrying [[interlaced video]], and the other progressive, or an interlaced/progressive switch (either a physical switch or a menu setting).\n\nIn Europe (but not most other PAL areas), [[SCART]] connectors are generally used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, but not all DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C ([[S-Video]]), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to [[YPbPr]] component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.)\n\n[[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] is a digital connection for carrying high-definition video, similar to [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]]. Along with video, HDMI also supports up to eight-channel digital audio. DVD players with connectors for high-definition video can [[Video scaler|upconvert]] the source to formats used for higher definition video (e.g., [[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], etc.), before outputting the signal. By no means, however, will the resulting signal be high-definition video; that is, aside from optional [[deinterlacing]], upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video's dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats, foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device.\n\n=== USB ===\nSome DVD players include a [[USB video recorder]]. As well as such, there are also have DVD players with a [[USB port]] to be able to play digital media types as well as MP4, MP3, etc.\n\n=== Wireless ===\nWireless connections ([[bluetooth]] and/or [[Wi-Fi]]) are useful to manage (play/record) wirelessly content from or to other devices (i.e. cell phones).\n\n== Prices ==\n{{As of|2014}}, retail prices for such a device, depending on its optional features (such as digital sound or video output), start between 30 and 80 [[USD]]/[[Euro]]. They are usually cheaper than [[VCR]]s.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{As of|2002}} the largest producer of DVD players is China; in 2002 they produced 30 million players, more than 70% of the world output. These producers have to pay US$15\u2013$20 per player in license fees, to the [[patent]] holders of the DVD technology ([[Sony]], [[Philips]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Time Warner]]) as well as for [[MPEG-2]] licenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020524S0091|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405112139/http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020524S0091|title=EE Times -Taiwan joins Chinese effort on proprietary DVD format|archivedate=April 5, 2004|work=eetimes.com}}</ref> To avoid these fees, China has developed the [[Enhanced Versatile Disc]] standard as an intended successor of DVD; {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, EVD players were only being sold in China.\n\n== Software ==\n'''Software DVD players''' are [[software|program]]s that allow users to view DVD videos on a [[computer]] with a [[DVD|DVD-ROM]] drive. Some examples are the [[VLC media player]], 5KPlayer and [[MPlayer]] (all [[free software]]), as well as [[WinDVD]], [[Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre|TotalMedia Theatre]], [[PowerDVD]], [[Fluendo DVD Player]] and [[DVD Player (software)|DVD Player]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videohelp.com/tools?listuser=&orderby=Rating&s=11#11|title=Video software and downloads|work=videohelp.com}}</ref>\n\nAmong others, there are variants & huge kinds of software DVD players as well as multimedia player software which has DVD video playback capability, whether its proprietary-type (as commercial software), freeware, shareware or just a free software are available in the market.\n\n== Successors ==\nIn the battle to succeed and to improve upon the role of the DVD player as the mainstream medium for stored audiovisual content on optical disc, there were two major contestants: the [[HD DVD]] player and the [[Blu-ray Disc]] player, utilizing two incompatible technologies that reproduced higher resolution video images and more complete audio information than was possible with DVD. On February 19, 2008, Toshiba, creator of the former technology, announced it would cease production on all HD DVD products, leaving Blu-ray as the high definition successor to DVD players. \n\nAs technology improved, various players were sold, some of which were also Blu-ray players, that could upscale and up-convert DVD content, increasing the overall perceived picture quality.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|DVD players}}\n*[[CD-ROM]]\n*[[Digital video recorder]]\n*[[DVD-Audio]]\n*[[Digital media player|HD media player]]\n*[[Film recorder|Recorder]]\n*[[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]\n*[[Video scaler]]\n*[[Comparison of portable media players]]\n*[[Compact Disc and DVD copy protection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|CD players}}\n* [https://www.wecanfigurethisout.org/VL/CD_DVD.htm The Inner Workings of CD/DVD Drives] WeCanFigureThisOut.org\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dvd Player}}\n[[Category:DVD|Player]]\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1996]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n[[Category:Home video]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n[[Category:Video hardware]]\n[[Category:20th-century inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the electronic device|the Microsoft Windows Software|DVD Player  (Windows)|the Apple software|DVD Player (Mac OS)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Sony DVD DVP-SR370 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Sony]] DVP-SR370 DVD player and USB support connection]]\n[[File:OdtwarzaczDVD-Philips.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Philips]] DVD player]]\n\nA '''DVD player''' is a device that plays [[DVD]]s produced under both the [[DVD-Video]] and [[DVD-Audio]] technical standards, two different and incompatible standards.

The reverse of the early Artaxiad coin typically shows an eagle standing on a mountain-top, which is presumably [[Mount Ararat]].{{sfn|Russell|1986|pp=659-660}} The eagle, which also appears on the Artaxiad crown, is a portrayal of the Iranian ''[[khvarenah|x\u1d5bar\u0259nah]]'' (\"glory\"), which was seen amongst the Iranians as a symbol that defended the legitimate monarch and his kingdom, even after his death.{{sfn|Romeny|2010|p=264}}\n\n==Family==\n===Marriages===\n* [[Satenik]], daughter of the king of [[Alans]].\n\n===Issue===\n* [[Artavasdes I of Armenia|Artavasdes I]], second Artaxiad king of Armenia.\n* [[Tigranes I]], third Artaxiad king of Armenia.\n* Vruyr\n* Mazhan\n* Zariadres\n* Tiran\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite book||url=http://serials.flib.sci.am/openreader/Hay%20joxovrdi%20patmutyun_%20h.1/book/index.html#page/532/mode/2up|last=Sargsyan|first=Gagik|author-link=Gagik Sargsyan|editor1-first=Yeremian|editor1-last=Suren|editor2-first=Martirosian|editor2-last=A.A|year=1971|chapter=\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0544\u056b\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0568 \u0587 \u0570\u0566\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0581\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0568 \u0531\u0580\u057f\u0561\u0577\u0565\u057d \u0531-\u056b \u0585\u0580\u0578\u0584 [The unification and strengthening of Armenia at the time of Arta\u0161\u0113s I]|title=\u0540\u0561\u0575 \u053a\u0578\u0572\u0578\u057e\u0580\u0564\u056b \u054a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576 [History Of The Armenian People]|publisher=Armenian Academy of Sciences|volume=1|pages=521\u2013551|}}\n*{{cite journal|url=http://hpj.asj-oa.am/1720/1/1971-3(274).pdf|last=Karakhanian|first=G.|author-link=|year= 1971|title=\u0531\u0580\u0561\u0574\u0565\u0565\u0580\u0565\u0576 \u0576\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0575\u057f \u0565\u0580\u056f\u0578\u0582 \u0561\u0580\u0571\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0563\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580 [Two new inscriptions in Aramaic]|journal=Historical-Philological Journal||issue=3|pages=274-276|ISSN=0135-0536|ref=harv}} {{in lang|hy}}\n*{{cite journal|url=http://hpj.asj-oa.am/3385/1/1980-4(257).pdf|last=\u0160ifman|first=Ilya|author-link=Ilya Shifman|year= 1980|title=\u0413\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 [Hannibal in Armenia]|journal=Historical-Philological Journal||issue=4|pages=257-261|ISSN=0135-0536}} {{in lang|ru}}\n*{{cite thesis |last=Litovchenko  |first=Sergey |date=2003 |title=\u0420\u0438\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 I \u0432. \u0434\u043e \u043d. \u044d. \u2011 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 I \u0432. \u043d. \u044d.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.
