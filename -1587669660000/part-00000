Sydney Manga and Anime Show''' (typically abbreviated to SMASH!) is an annual [[Japanese popular culture]] convention held in Sydney, Australia and organised by SMASH Inc, a non-profit volunteer-run association. The convention has been run annually since 2007.<ref name='SMH'>{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/about-town/anime-attraction-20120712-21wu1.html | title = Anime attraction | accessdate = 2013-03-14 | last = Treuen | first = Jason | date = 2012-07-13 | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nSMASH! began as an art-focused event but has broadened its scope to include all areas of Japanese popular culture. It was the first Australian anime convention to host a Japanese voice actor, the first to host a Japanese anime director, the first to hold a [[maid caf\u00e9]] and the first to hold the national final for the [[Gunpla Builders World Cup]].\n\n== History ==\nSMASH! was conceived by Katie Huang, an artist and illustrator living and working in Sydney. The event was originally called ComicWorld Sydney and was more closely modelled on the [[Comic World]] events held in [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]. As the number of people involved in organising the event increased, the focus broadened and the name was changed to SMASH! Sydney Manga and Anime Show.\n\nSMASH! 2020 was postponed four months prior to the scheduled start of the event<ref>https://smash.org.au/covid-19-announcement/</ref>. The postponement was announced following Australian Government advice regarding the organisation of public gatherings<ref>https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-organising-public-gatherings_1.pdf</ref> during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nSMASH! is run by SMASH Inc, a non-profit association incorporated in New South Wales. SMASH Inc is controlled by a board elected each year by the members of the association. The board in turn selects a management team responsible for the planning and day-to-day conduct of the convention as well as a staff of volunteers organised into various departments. The board, management and staff total more than 50 people.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smash.org.au/details/organisers/ |title = SMASH! 2013 Organisers |publisher = SMASH Inc |accessdate = 2013-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Mascots ==\n\nThe convention features two mascots, a boy, Cyrus, and a girl, Skadi. The mascots were designed in 2007 by Sai Nitivoranant and have been drawn by numerous artists, including guests of the convention, Tan Kit Mun, Alexandra Szweryn and Shaun Healey.\n\n== Event History ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Date !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Venue !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Attendance !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\"| Price !!

Sydney Manga and Anime Show''' (typically abbreviated to SMASH!) is an annual [[Japanese popular culture]] convention held in Sydney, Australia and organised by SMASH Inc, a non-profit volunteer-run association. The convention has been run annually since 2007.<ref name='SMH'>{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/about-town/anime-attraction-20120712-21wu1.html | title = Anime attraction | accessdate = 2013-03-14 | last = Treuen | first = Jason | date = 2012-07-13 | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nSMASH! began as an art-focused event but has broadened its scope to include all areas of Japanese popular culture. It was the first Australian anime convention to host a Japanese voice actor, the first to host a Japanese anime director, the first to hold a [[maid caf\u00e9]] and the first to hold the national final for the [[Gunpla Builders World Cup]].\n\n== History ==\nSMASH! was conceived by Katie Huang, an artist and illustrator living and working in Sydney. The event was originally called ComicWorld Sydney and was more closely modelled on the [[Comic World]] events held in [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]. As the number of people involved in organising the event increased, the focus broadened and the name was changed to SMASH! Sydney Manga and Anime Show.\n\nSMASH! 2020 was postponed four months prior to the scheduled start of the event<ref>https://smash.org.au/covid-19-announcement/</ref>. The postponement was announced following Australian Government advice regarding the organisation of public gatherings<ref>https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-organising-public-gatherings_1.pdf</ref> during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nSMASH! is run by SMASH Inc, a non-profit association incorporated in New South Wales. SMASH Inc is controlled by a board elected each year by the members of the association. The board in turn selects a management team responsible for the planning and day-to-day conduct of the convention as well as a staff of volunteers organised into various departments. The board, management and staff total more than 50 people.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smash.org.au/details/organisers/ |title = SMASH! 2013 Organisers |publisher = SMASH Inc |accessdate = 2013-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Mascots ==\n\nThe convention features two mascots, a boy, Cyrus, and a girl, Skadi. The mascots were designed in 2007 by Sai Nitivoranant and have been drawn by numerous artists, including guests of the convention, Tan Kit Mun, Alexandra Szweryn and Shaun Healey.\n\n== Event History ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Date !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Venue !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Attendance !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\"| Price !!

At Harvard, Lennarz worked on research pertaining to the biosynthesis of fatty acids in yeast. Through his work at Harvard, he was able to play a role in discovering [[acyl carrier protein]], which is an enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle. After leaving Harvard, Lennarz was employed at Johns Hopkins and the University of Texas Cancer Center before arriving at Stony Brook.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lennarz has multiple publications since arriving at Stony Brook in 1989.

Along with [[Luis Federico Leloir|Luis Leloir]], Robert Spiro, Edward Heath, Lennarz was able to determine the mechanism by which [[N-linked oligosaccharides]] are added to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Lennarz and his lab mates discovered that these sugars are transferred as a group, and are synthesized from a dolicol-linked oligosaccharide with a conserved structure. They found the precursor for these molecules had the structure (Man)<sub>n</sub>GlcNAc<sup>B1,4</sup> \u2192GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, and each precursor had at least five mannose residues.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Kornfeld|first=Stuart|date=2018-06-20|title=A Lifetime of Adventures in Glycobiology|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-biochem-062917-011911|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1146/annurev-biochem-062917-011911|issn=0066-4154|doi-access=free}}</ref> \u00a0Additionally, they discovered that precursor molecules contain one to two glucose molecules, which was a surprising find. Up until this point, all N-linked oligosaccharides that had been characterized lacked glucose molecules. This lead the group to postulate that the oligosaccharide component of the precursor was modified by [[Glycoside hydrolase|glycosidase]] enzymes before the glycoprotein could be considered mature. This work was very important in laying the foundation for later research that described the mechanism for the complete assembly glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Recent work ===\nIn 2006, Lennarz and several colleagues published a study on the peptide [[N-glycanase 1|N-glycanase]] (PNGase). This protein helps in the process of misfolded glycoprotein degradation by removing oligosaccharide chains from the proteins. Lennarz and colleagues used the mouse PNGase Png1P to study the interaction of this protein with the proteasome. GST fusion proteins of each protein being observed in the study were produced in ''E. coli'' in order to reliably purify each protein.\u00a0 The study found that in vitro, the mouse PNGase interacted directly with the proteins mHR23B and ms4. It was previously believed that ATP was a requirement for PNGases to interact with the proteasome, but this study found that this was not the case. Through this study, Lennarz and his team were also able to determine which region of the mouse PNGase was responsible for binding to ms4. It was found that the N-terminus of the PNGase was essential in binding to ms4. Compared to yeast PNGase proteins, which had been previously \u00a0studied at the time of this experiment, mice PNGase proteins have an extended N-terminus that contains a [[Phosphotyrosine-binding domain|PUB domain]]. By truncating PNGase amino acids 1-171 (which compose the N-terminus), Lennarz and his team found this additional domain was not sufficient to bind ms4 by itself, indicating that the entirety of the N-terminus is required for proper binding.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=G.|last2=Zhou|first2=X.|last3=Zhao|first3=G.|last4=Schindelin|first4=H.|last5=Lennarz|first5=W.

They discovered that binding to mHR23B is likely what activates the C-terminal catalytic domain of PNGase. Binding of these two proteins was also found to govern the interaction between mHR23B and p97, another protein involved in the proteasome degradation pathway. The two binding proteins were also found to compete with each other to bind the PNGase, and a complex of all three proteins was found to be unable to form.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAnother notable study by Lennarz sought to determine the location at which [[oligosaccharyltransferase]] (OT) binds the ribosome. This enzyme is responsible for transferring high mannose oligosaccharides to polypeptides translocating into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The study used purified ribosomes and yeast oligosaccharyltransferase to conduct each experiment. It was found that OT binds the ribosome, and the [[Sec61]] transolocon complex binds the ribosome as well to form a complex to glycosylate N-linked oligosaccharides on proteins translocating into the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, Lennarz and his team showed that OT binds the 60S subunit of 80S yeast ribosomes in a 1:1 molar ratio through chemical cross-linking experiments. The protein was found to specifically bind to the location on the ribosome where the translocating polypeptide exits, which is supported by its enzymatic function.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harada|first=Yoichiro|last2=Li|first2=Hua|last3=Li|first3=Huilin|last4=Lennarz|first4=William J.|date=2009-04-28|title=Oligosaccharyltransferase directly binds to ribosome at a location near the translocon-binding site|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.0812489106|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=17|pages=6945\u20136949|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812489106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2678446|pmid=19365066}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Lennarz was involved in the study of the structure of the [[SEC63|Sec63]] translocon complex, which is involved in translocating pre-synthesized polypeptides from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the heptameric structure of the complex was able to be visualized in greater detail. The complex was found to have a mass of 287 kilodaltons, as was found to be composed of three subcomplexes. The complex was found to be composed of a Sec61-Sbh1-Sss1 translocon complex, a heterotetramer composed of Sec62-Sec63-Sec71-Sec72, and a trimer composed of Sec63-Sec71-Sec72. During their assessment of the study of this complex, Lennarz and his team also found that positively charged amino acids in the Sec61 component of the complex were responsible for mediating the formation of the complex.

The group rose to prominence in the early [[2000s in music|2000s]], with hit singles such as \"How You Like Me Now?\" and \"Come Again.\" Takahashi was also a member of [[Avex]]'s 20th anniversary dance music project [[Ravex]], and has produced songs for musicians such as [[Crystal Kay]], [[Ami Suzuki]] and [[Rie Fu]], and remixes for [[Hikaru Utada]] and [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]. He formed the record labels Tachytelic Records and TCY Recording.\n\nTaku Takahashi has occasionally rapped in his songs, such as on M-Flo's songs \"Get On!\" and \"The Rhyme Brokers,\" and occasionally sung vocals (\"I Wanna Be Down,\" \"Love Long and Prosper\", \"Toxic Sweet\").\n\n==Biography==\n\nTaku Takahashi grew up in [[Yokohama]], with his father employed in the construction industry. He attended high school in Tokyo, at [[St. Mary's International School]], along with [[Verbal (rapper)|Verbal]]. In 1992, the pair formed a [[rap rock]] band called N.M.D. in 1992, in which Takahashi wrote the music and performed the drums. The band received many offers from major record labels after their live performances, however as Verbal did not see being a rapper as a practical career, these offers were turned down.<ref name=\"Crown Jewel\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/cjcr/archives/50711535.html|title=Clothes Relay <nowiki>[\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc]</nowiki> - VERBAL\u3055\u3093\uff08m-flo \u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\uff09|author=CROWN JEWEL|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2009-04-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508120308/http://blog.livedoor.jp/cjcr/archives/50711535.html|archivedate=2009-05-08}}</ref> The pair went their separate ways after high school, with Takahashi travelling to [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]] in 1994, attending [[Occidental College]],<ref name=\"JWave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.j-wave.co.jp/blog/tomorrow/archives/cat_535.php?page=37 |title=\u91d1\u525b\u5730\u6b66\u5fd7 /TOMORROW: \u3053\u308c\u304b\u3089\u4e8c\u5341\u6b73\u3092\u8fce\u3048\u308b\u82e5\u8005\u3068\u6614\u4e8c\u5341\u6b73\u3060\u3063\u305f\u4eba\u3005\u3078 |publisher=J-Wave |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021113429/http://j-wave.co.jp/blog/tomorrow/archives/cat_535.php?page=37 |archivedate=October 21, 2007}}</ref> and Verbal to [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godarea.net/index08054success.html |title=VERBAL\uff08m-flo\uff09\u30d1\u30fc\u30d1\u30eb \u795e\u69d8\u306e\u9818\u57df|author=\u30aa\u30a6\u30b5\u30f3\u5de5\u623faccessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Takahashi tried majoring in physics, philosophy and Asian Studies with little success.<ref name=\"JWave\"/> He enrolled in a local music school, beginning his career as a DJ and songwriter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://365blog.mtvjapan.com/?eid=150|title=\u3010MTV\u3011\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30fb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\uff1c7\u6708\u306e\u7279\u96c6\uff1e|author=MTV-Staff|work=MTV 365 World Trip \u301c on SMIRNOFF ROAD \u301cBLOG|date=2008-06-27|accessdate=2008-10-28}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nTakahashi returned to Japan in the mid 1990s, and formed a musical unit with a female vocalist, called Love Soul. After sending a demo tape of this group to Artimage management, Takahashi met Masaji Asakawa from the DJ group GTS. Takahashi began producing music full-time, and in 1998 recorded a cover of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\" with Verbal when he returned to Japan for winter break.<ref name=\"Crown Jewel\"/> This song, followed by \"Been So Long,\" featuring vocals from [[LISA (Japanese musician, born 1974)|Lisa]], was well received by Asakawa, leading the trio to form the group M-Flo, officially debuting in 1999. The group's first release, \"The Tripod E.P.,\" debuted in the top 10 on the Japanese singles chart.<ref name=\"Oricon\">{{cite web | title=\u30aa\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u60c5\u5831\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u300cyou\u5927\u6a39\u300d | url=http://ranking.oricon.co.jp | work=[[Oricon]] | accessdate=2010-08-13}} (subscription only)</ref> The group achieved great success in 2000 and 2001 with the songs \"How You Like Me Now?\" and \"Come Again,\" with the former selling more than 220,000 copies, and the latter approximately 390,000 copies.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/> The band's second album, ''[[Expo Expo]]'', debuted at #4 on the charts.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Lisa left M-Flo to follow a solo career, causing the band to begin releasing albums with a variety of famous vocalists. This led to Takahashi working on collaborations with a variety of artists. His first notable produced singles were [[Crystal Kay]]'s \"Hard to Say\" and \"Boyfriend (Part II)\" in 2002/2003. At the same time, he created a production label, Tachytelic Records. An audition was held to find vocalists for Takahashi to produce, with the grand winner being songwriter [[Emi Hinouchi]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Tachytelic Records | url=http://www.tachytelic.co.jp/tachy_main.html | work=Tachytelic Records | year=2007 | accessdate=2010-08-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615063259/http://www.tachytelic.co.jp/tachy_main.html | archive-date=15 June 2010 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Between 2002 and 2003, the label produced six releases: Emi Hinouchi's first four singles and debut album, along with a DJ mix tape created by Takahashi called ''Tachytelic Night: Welcomes You to the Far East''. However, none of the releases were successful, with all of the releases charting under the #100 mark on [[Oricon]] charts.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/> The label continued to promote events, such as the regular ''Tachytelic Night'' DJ set events, and Takahashi produced the [[Pro Evolution Soccer 6]] theme song, [[Ukatrats FC]]'s \"Win and Shine.\" However, after 2006 the label ceased to exist.\n\nTakahashi continued working full-time with M-Flo until mid 2007, when the tour for the group's fifth album ''[[Cosmicolor]]'' finished and M-Flo ceased regular activities. Since then, the group released a string of compilation albums, such as greatest hit albums and outside collaborative work compilation albums. Takahashi has regularly produced songs and remixes for musicians, including several Western artists ([[Calvin Harris]], [[Lady Sovereign]], [[The Ting Tings]]). He has participated in many DJ events, including his self-produced Orthosync events, and many [[House Nation]] events. In 2008, Takahashi became a member of [[Ravex]], a three DJ group formed for the 20th anniversary of the [[Avex]] music group. The group's resulting 2009 album, ''[[Trax (album)|Trax]]'', was much like M-Flo's later albums, featuring a collection of vocalists from across Avex record labels.\n\nIn 2010, Taku Takahashi launched his second record label, TCY Recording, featuring dance music artists such as [[TeddyLoid]] and [[Hoshina Anniversary]]. He found most of them on [[MySpace]] music.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-6294 | title=m-flo's Taku launches new label | date=July 1, 2010 | publisher=Tokyo Graph | accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref> He also began working as a music director, for the [[Gainax]] animated series ''[[Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt]]'', which began airing in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title=m-flo\u306e\u2606Taku Takahashi\u3001\u30ac\u30a4\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u62c5\u5f53 | url=http://tower.jp/article/news/69649 | work=Tower Records | date=2010-09-09 | accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Taku Takahashi filled in for [[Kissy Sellout]]'s radio show on BBC Radio 1 as part of \"[[Jaguar Skills]] and His Amazing Friends.\" <ref>{{cite web | title=BBC Radio 1-Friday Oct 14 2011 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015mvgn}}</ref> His ten-minute mix included remixes of songs from his time with m-flo and the ''Godzilla'' theme.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|M-Flo#Discography|Ravex#Discography}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"1\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"1\"| Album Information\n! colspan=\"1\"| ''[[Oricon]]''<br/>albums<br/>charts<br/><ref name=\"Oricon\"/>\n! colspan=\"1\"| Reported<br/>sales<br/><ref name=\"Oricon\"/>\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2003\n|'''''Tachytelic Night: Welcomes You to the Far East'''''\n*Mix-tape\n*Released: March 5, 2003\n*Label: Tachytelic Records (CTCR-14243)\n*Formats: [[Compact disc|CD]], [[Paid download|digital download]]\n|align=\"center\"|138\n|align=\"center\"|3,900<!--3,875-->\n|-\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|2010\n|'''''TCY Rec Special Pack EP Vol. 1'''''\n*Compilation of TCY Recording recordings\n*Released: June 23, 2010\n*Label: Artimage\n*Formats: Digital download\n|align=\"center\"|\u2014\n|align=\"center\"|\u2014\n|-\n|'''''TCY Rec Special Pack EP Vol. 2'''''\n*Compilation of TCY Recording recordings\n*Released: September 1, 2010\n*Label: Artimage\n*Formats: Digital download\n|align=\"center\"|\u2014\n|align=\"center\"|\u2014\n|-\n|'''''[[Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt#Music|Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt: The Original Soundtrack]]'''''\n*''[[Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt]]'' soundtrack, performed with TCY Crew\n*Released: December 29, 2010\n*Label: [[Victor Entertainment|Flying Dog]] (VTCL-60236)\n*Formats: CD, digital download\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|align=\"center\"|30,000<!--30,045-->\n|-\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|2011\n|'''''[[After 5 Vol. 1]]'''''\n*Mix-tape, performed as ''The Suitboys a.k.a.

He formed the record labels Tachytelic Records and TCY Recording.\n\nTaku Takahashi has occasionally rapped in his songs, such as on M-Flo's songs \"Get On!\" and \"The Rhyme Brokers,\" and occasionally sung vocals (\"I Wanna Be Down,\" \"Love Long and Prosper\", \"Toxic Sweet\").\n\n==Biography==\n\nTaku Takahashi grew up in [[Yokohama]], with his father employed in the construction industry. He attended high school in Tokyo, at [[St. Mary's International School]], along with [[Verbal (rapper)|Verbal]]. In 1992, the pair formed a [[rap rock]] band called N.M.D. in 1992, in which Takahashi wrote the music and performed the drums. The band received many offers from major record labels after their live performances, however as Verbal did not see being a rapper as a practical career, these offers were turned down.<ref name=\"Crown Jewel\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/cjcr/archives/50711535.html|title=Clothes Relay <nowiki>[\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc]</nowiki> - VERBAL\u3055\u3093\uff08m-flo \u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\uff09|author=CROWN JEWEL|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2009-04-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508120308/http://blog.livedoor.jp/cjcr/archives/50711535.html|archivedate=2009-05-08}}</ref> The pair went their separate ways after high school, with Takahashi travelling to [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]] in 1994, attending [[Occidental College]],<ref name=\"JWave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.j-wave.co.jp/blog/tomorrow/archives/cat_535.php?page=37 |title=\u91d1\u525b\u5730\u6b66\u5fd7 /TOMORROW: \u3053\u308c\u304b\u3089\u4e8c\u5341\u6b73\u3092\u8fce\u3048\u308b\u82e5\u8005\u3068\u6614\u4e8c\u5341\u6b73\u3060\u3063\u305f\u4eba\u3005\u3078 |publisher=J-Wave |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021113429/http://j-wave.co.jp/blog/tomorrow/archives/cat_535.php?page=37 |archivedate=October 21, 2007}}</ref> and Verbal to [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godarea.net/index08054success.html |title=VERBAL\uff08m-flo\uff09\u30d1\u30fc\u30d1\u30eb \u795e\u69d8\u306e\u9818\u57df|author=\u30aa\u30a6\u30b5\u30f3\u5de5\u623faccessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Takahashi tried majoring in physics, philosophy and Asian Studies with little success.<ref name=\"JWave\"/> He enrolled in a local music school, beginning his career as a DJ and songwriter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://365blog.mtvjapan.com/?eid=150|title=\u3010MTV\u3011\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30fb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\uff1c7\u6708\u306e\u7279\u96c6\uff1e|author=MTV-Staff|work=MTV 365 World Trip \u301c on SMIRNOFF ROAD \u301cBLOG|date=2008-06-27|accessdate=2008-10-28}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nTakahashi returned to Japan in the mid 1990s, and formed a musical unit with a female vocalist, called Love Soul. After sending a demo tape of this group to Artimage management, Takahashi met Masaji Asakawa from the DJ group GTS. Takahashi began producing music full-time, and in 1998 recorded a cover of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\" with Verbal when he returned to Japan for winter break.<ref name=\"Crown Jewel\"/> This song, followed by \"Been So Long,\" featuring vocals from [[LISA (Japanese musician, born 1974)|Lisa]], was well received by Asakawa, leading the trio to form the group M-Flo, officially debuting in 1999. The group's first release, \"The Tripod E.P.,\" debuted in the top 10 on the Japanese singles chart.<ref name=\"Oricon\">{{cite web | title=\u30aa\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u60c5\u5831\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u300cyou\u5927\u6a39\u300d | url=http://ranking.oricon.co.jp | work=[[Oricon]] | accessdate=2010-08-13}} (subscription only)</ref> The group achieved great success in 2000 and 2001 with the songs \"How You Like Me Now?\" and \"Come Again,\" with the former selling more than 220,000 copies, and the latter approximately 390,000 copies.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/> The band's second album, ''[[Expo Expo]]'', debuted at #4 on the charts.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/>\n\nIn 2002, Lisa left M-Flo to follow a solo career, causing the band to begin releasing albums with a variety of famous vocalists. This led to Takahashi working on collaborations with a variety of artists. His first notable produced singles were [[Crystal Kay]]'s \"Hard to Say\" and \"Boyfriend (Part II)\" in 2002/2003. At the same time, he created a production label, Tachytelic Records. An audition was held to find vocalists for Takahashi to produce, with the grand winner being songwriter [[Emi Hinouchi]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Tachytelic Records | url=http://www.tachytelic.co.jp/tachy_main.html | work=Tachytelic Records | year=2007 | accessdate=2010-08-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615063259/http://www.tachytelic.co.jp/tachy_main.html | archive-date=15 June 2010 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Between 2002 and 2003, the label produced six releases: Emi Hinouchi's first four singles and debut album, along with a DJ mix tape created by Takahashi called ''Tachytelic Night: Welcomes You to the Far East''. However, none of the releases were successful, with all of the releases charting under the #100 mark on [[Oricon]] charts.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/> The label continued to promote events, such as the regular ''Tachytelic Night'' DJ set events, and Takahashi produced the [[Pro Evolution Soccer 6]] theme song, [[Ukatrats FC]]'s \"Win and Shine.\" However, after 2006 the label ceased to exist.\n\nTakahashi continued working full-time with M-Flo until mid 2007, when the tour for the group's fifth album ''[[Cosmicolor]]'' finished and M-Flo ceased regular activities. Since then, the group released a string of compilation albums, such as greatest hit albums and outside collaborative work compilation albums. Takahashi has regularly produced songs and remixes for musicians, including several Western artists ([[Calvin Harris]], [[Lady Sovereign]], [[The Ting Tings]]). He has participated in many DJ events, including his self-produced Orthosync events, and many [[House Nation]] events. In 2008, Takahashi became a member of [[Ravex]], a three DJ group formed for the 20th anniversary of the [[Avex]] music group. The group's resulting 2009 album, ''[[Trax (album)|Trax]]'', was much like M-Flo's later albums, featuring a collection of vocalists from across Avex record labels.\n\nIn 2010, Taku Takahashi launched his second record label, TCY Recording, featuring dance music artists such as [[Teddyloid]] and [[Hoshina Anniversary]].

He left a lasting impact on [[televangelism]] and the modern [[Charismatic movement]] and is recognized as the \"principal architect of [[restorationism|restorationist]] thought\" for Charismatics by some Christian historians.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=119}} At the time they were held, his inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American [[Deliverance ministry|deliverance minister]] to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed to have received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame spread rapidly as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set in motion the broader healing revival that later became the modern Charismatic movement. From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [[Pentecostal]] churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings known as the [[Full Gospel]] tradition, Branham developed an alternate theology that was primarily a mixture of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [[dispensationalism]] and Branham's own unique [[Eschatology|eschatological]] views. While widely accepting the [[Restorationism|restoration]] doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his Charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=55}} Many of his followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral scripture and refer to his teachings as The Message. In 1963, Branham preached a sermon in which he indicated he was a prophet with the anointing of [[Elijah]], who had come to herald [[Second Coming|Christ's second coming]]. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [[cult of personality]] during his final years. Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted through the William Branham Evangelistic Association, who reported in 2018 that about 2 million people receive their material. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Birthplace of William Branham as shown in William Branham A Man Sent From God 1950.jpg|alt=A log cabin with some logs missing and a lean-to attached to its side|thumb|right|The dirt-floor log cabin that was William Branham's birthplace as shown in his biography ''William Branham: A Man Sent From God'']]\n\nWilliam M.

He traveled to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where he worked for two years on a ranch and began a successful career in boxing.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=28}} He returned to Jeffersonville when his brother died in 1929.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=28}}{{sfn|Duyzer|2014|p=27}} Branham had no experience with religion as a child; he said the first time he heard a prayer was at his brother's funeral.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=25}} Soon after, while working for the [[Public Service Company of Indiana]], Branham was almost killed when he was overcome by gas.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=25}} While recovering from the accident, he said he again heard a voice leading him to begin seeking God.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=25}} He began attending a local [[Independent Baptist]] church, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville, where he converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=26, 33}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=28}} Six months later, he was ordained as an Independent Baptist minister.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=28}} His early ministry was an \"impressive success\"; he quickly attracted a small group of followers, who helped obtain a tent in which he could hold a revival.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=28}}\n\nAt the time of Branham's conversion, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville was a nominally Baptist church that observed some Pentecostal doctrines, including [[faith healing|divine healing]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=33}} As a result, he may have been exposed to some Pentecostal teachings from his conversion.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=32\u201334}} He was first exposed to a Pentecostal denominational church in 1936, which invited him to join, but he refused.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=33}}{{efn|Pentecostalism is a renewal movement that started in the early 20th century that stresses a post-conversion [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]] for all Christians, with speaking in tongues (\"[[glossolalia]]\") as the initial evidence of this baptism.<ref>See Grenz, p. 90.</ref>}}\n\nDuring June 1933, Branham held revival meetings in his tent.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=28}} On June 2 that year, the ''[[News and Tribune|Jeffersonville Evening News]]'' said the Branham campaign reported 14 converts.<ref>{{cite news| author1 =Staff writers| title = Fourteen Converted| work= Jeffersonville Evening News| date = June 2, 1933| location= Jeffersonville, Indiana | page = 4}}</ref> His followers believed his ministry was accompanied by miraculous signs from its beginning, and that when he was baptizing converts on June 11, 1933, in the [[Ohio River]] near Jeffersonville, a bright light descended over him and that he heard a voice say, \"As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, so your message will forerun His second coming\".{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=29}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=27}} Belief in the baptismal story is a critical element of faith among Branham's followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=27\u201328}} Branham initially interpreted this in reference to the restoration of the [[Spiritual gift|gifts of the spirit]] to the church and made regular references to the baptismal story from the earliest days of the healing revival.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=28}} In later years, Branham also connected the story to his teaching ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=29}} Baptist historian [[Doug Weaver (Author)|Doug Weaver]] said Branham might have embellished the baptismal story when he was achieving success in the healing revival.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Branham Tabernacle c. 1935 as seen in William Branham, A Man Sent From God 1950.jpg|alt=The front of a brick building with white double doors and windows on either side and a sign above the door|thumb|right|Branham Tabernacle c. 1935]]\n\nFollowing his June tent meeting, Branham's supporters helped him organize a new church, the Branham Tabernacle, in Jeffersonville.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=32}} Branham served as pastor from 1933 to 1946.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=32}} The church flourished at first, but its growth began to slow.

Crowder suggested Branham's gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=330}} Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=40}} Weaver agreed Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for the healing revival, mainly over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=92}} The [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]] were the first to openly withdraw support from the healing revival in 1953.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=92}} Weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy the initial [[ecumenism]] of the revival; tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists' fund-raising methods, denominational pride, sensationalism, and doctrinal conflicts\u2014particularly between the [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=92}}\n\n==Later life==\n===Teaching ministry===\n\nAs the healing revival began to wane, many of Branham's contemporaries moved into the leadership of the emerging Charismatic movement, which emphasized use of spiritual gifts.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=93}} The Charismatic movement is a global movement within both Protestant and non-Protestant Christianity that supports the adoption of traditionally Pentecostal beliefs, especially the spiritual gifts ([[Spiritual gift|charismata]]). The movement began in the teachings of the healing revival evangelists and grew as their teachings came to receive broad acceptance among millions of Christians.<ref>Grenz, p. 162.</ref> At the same time the Charismatic movement was gaining broad acceptance, Branham began to transition to a teaching ministry. He began speaking on the controversial doctrinal issues he had avoided for most of the revival.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=173}} By the 1960s, Branham's contemporaries and the Pentecostal denominations that had supported his campaigns regarded him as an extremely controversial teacher.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}} The leadership of the Pentecostal churches pressed Branham to resist his urge to teach and to instead focus on praying for the sick.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=108}} Branham refused, arguing that the purpose of his healing ministry was to attract audiences and, having thus been attracted, it was time to teach them the doctrines he claimed to have received through supernatural revelation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=108\u2013109}} Branham argued that his entire ministry was divinely inspired and could not be selectively rejected or accepted, saying, \"It's either all of God, or none of God\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=108}}\n\nAt first, Branham taught his doctrines only within his own church at Jeffersonville, but beginning in the 1960s he began to preach them at other churches he visited.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=108}} His criticisms of Pentecostal organizations, and especially his views on holiness and the role of women, led to his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement and the Pentecostals from whom he had originally achieved popularity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=97}} Branham acknowledged their rejection and said their organizations \"had choked out the glory and Spirit of God\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=97}}  As a result of their view of his teachings, many Pentecostals judged that Branham had \"stepped out of his anointing\" and had become a \"bad teacher of heretical doctrine\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=140}}\n\nDespite his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement, Branham's followers became increasingly dedicated to him during his later life; some even claimed he was the [[Messiah]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Branham quickly condemned their belief as heresy and threatened to stop ministering, but the belief persisted.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Many followers moved great distances to live near his home in Jeffersonville and, led by Leo Mercer, subsequently set up a colony in Arizona following Branham's move to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in 1962.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Branham lamented Mercer and the actions of his group as he worried that a cult was potentially being formed among his most fanatical followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}}\n\nBranham continued to travel to churches and preach his doctrine across North America during the 1960s. He held his final set of revival meetings in Shreveport at the church of his early campaign manager Jack Moore in November 1965.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}}\n\n===Teachings===\n\nBranham developed a unique theology and placed emphasis on a few key doctrines, including his [[eschatology|eschatological]] views, [[annihilationism]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism|oneness of the Godhead]], [[predestination]], [[Perseverance of the saints|eternal security]], and the [[Serpent seed|serpent's seed]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=118, 98}} His followers refer to his teachings collectively as \"The Message\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}} Kydd and Weaver have both referred to Branham's teachings as \"Branhamology\".{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=176}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}} Most of Branham's teachings have precedents within sects of the Pentecostal movement or in other non-Pentecostal denominations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}} The doctrines Branham imported from non-Pentecostal theology and the unique combination of doctrines that he created as a result led to widespread criticism from Pentecostal churches and the Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}} His unique arrangement of doctrines, coupled with the highly controversial nature of the serpent seed doctrine, caused the alienation of many of his former supporters.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nThe [[Full Gospel]] tradition, which has its roots in [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]], is the theology generally adhered to by the Charismatic movement and Pentecostal denominations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}} Branham's doctrines are a blend of both [[Calvinism]] and [[Arminianism]], which are considered contradictory by many theologians.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=121}} As a result, his theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally during the years of the healing revival.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}} Many of his followers regard his sermons as oral scripture and believe Branham had rediscovered the true doctrines of the early church.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}}\n\n====Divine healing====\n{{further|Faith healing#Christianity|Deliverance ministry}}\n\nThroughout his ministry, Branham taught a doctrine of faith healing that was often the central teaching he espoused during the healing campaign.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} He believed healing was the main focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and believed in a dual [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]; \"salvation for the soul and healing for the body\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} He believed and taught that miracles ascribed to Christ in the New Testament were also possible in modern times.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} Branham believed all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by the faith of the person desiring healing.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} Branham argued that God was required to heal when faith was present.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} This led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} Branham's teaching on divine healing were within the mainstream of Pentecostal theology and echoed the doctrines taught by [[Smith Wigglesworth]], Bosworth, and other prominent Pentecostal ministers of the prior generation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}}\n\n====Annihilationism====\n{{further|Annihilationism}}\n\nAnnihilationism, the doctrine that the damned will be totally destroyed after the final judgment so as to not exist, was introduced to Pentecostalism in the teachings of [[Charles Fox Parham]] (1873\u20131929).{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=117\u2013118}} Not all Pentecostal sects accepted the idea.<ref>Douglas Gordon Jacobsen.

Allen]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} Branham condemned any emphasis on expensive church buildings, elaborate choir robes, and large salaries for ministers, and insisted the church should focus on the imminent return of Christ.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=169}}\n\nBranham's opposition to modern culture emerged most strongly in his condemnation of the \"immorality of modern women\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} He taught that women with [[short hair]] were breaking God's commandments and according to Weaver, \"ridiculed women's desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=110}} Branham believed women were guilty of committing adultery if their appearance was intended to motivate men to lust, and viewed a woman's place as \"in the kitchen\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=110}} Citing the creation story in which Eve is taken from [[Adam's Rib|Adam's side]], Branham taught that woman was a byproduct of man.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} According to Weaver, \"his pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory\" and he regularly offered glowing praise of women.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} Weaver stated that Branham \"once told women who wore [[shorts]] not to call themselves Christians\" but qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to the [[outward holiness|holiness moral code]] was not a requirement for salvation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} Branham did not condemn women who refused the holiness moral code to [[Hell]], but he insisted they would not be part of the [[rapture]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}}\n\nWeaver wrote that Branham's attitude to women concerning physical appearance, sexual drive, and marital relations was misogynistic,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=112}} and that Branham saw modern women as \"essentially immoral sexual machines who were to blame for adultery, divorce and death. They were the tools of the Devil.\"{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}} Some of Branham's contemporaries accused him of being a \"woman hater\", but he insisted he only hated immorality.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} According to [[Edward Babinski]], women who follow the holiness moral code Branham supported regard it as \"a badge of honor\".{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}}\n\n====Serpent's seed====\n{{further|Serpent Seed|Original Sin}}\nBranham taught an unorthodox doctrine of the source of [[original sin]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}} He believed the story of the [[fall of man]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] is allegorical and interpreted it to mean the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] had sexual intercourse with Eve and that their offspring was [[Cain]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}} Branham taught that Cain's modern descendants were masquerading as educated people and scientists,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=113}} and that Cain's descendants were \"a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children\"{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=125}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=50}} who comprised the majority of society's criminals.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=174}} He believed the serpent was the [[Transitional fossil|missing link]] between the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] and man, and speculated that the serpent was possibly a human-like giant.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=124}} Branham held the belief that the serpent was transformed into a reptile after it was cursed by God.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=124}} Weaver commented on Branham's interpretation of the story; \"Consequently every woman potentially carried the literal seed of the devil\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}}\n\nBranham first spoke about original sin in 1958; he rejected the orthodox view of the subject and hinted at his own belief in a hidden meaning to the story.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} In later years, he made his opinion concerning the sexual nature of the fall explicitly known.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} Weaver wrote that Branham may have become acquainted with serpent's seed doctrine through his Baptist roots; [[Daniel Parker (Baptist)|Daniel Parker]], an American Baptist minister from Kentucky, promulgated a [[Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists|similar doctrine]] in the mid-1800s.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=125}} According to Pearry Green, Branham's teaching on the serpent's seed doctrine was viewed by the broader Pentecostal movement as the \"filthy doctrine&nbsp;... that ruined his ministry\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} No other mainstream Christian group held a similar view; Branham was widely criticized for spreading the doctrine.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} His followers view the doctrine as one of his greatest revelations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}}\n\n====Eschatology====\n\nIn 1960, Branham preached a series of sermons on the [[Seven churches of Asia|seven church ages]] based on chapters two and three of the [[Book of Revelation]]. The sermons closely aligned with the teachings of [[C. I. Scofield]] and [[Clarence Larkin]], the leading proponents of [[dispensationalism]] in the preceding generation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99, 103}} Like Larkin and Scofield, Branham said each church represents a historical age, and taught that the angel of each age was a significant church figure.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=99}} The message included the description of a messenger to the [[Laodicean Church]] age, which Branham believed would immediately precede the rapture.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=99}} Branham explained the Laodicean age would be immoral in a way comparable to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and it would be a time in which Christian denominations rejected Christ.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=129\u2013130}}  As described by Branham, the characteristics of the Laodicean age resemble those of the modern era.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=99}} Branham described the characteristics of the Laodicean messenger by comparing his traits to [[Elijah]] and [[John the Baptist]]. He asserted the messenger would be a mighty prophet who put the Word of God first, that he would be a lover of the wilderness, that he would hate wicked women, and be an uneducated person.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=129}}  Branham claimed the messenger to this last age would come in the spirit of Elijah the prophet and cited the [[Book of Malachi]] 4:5\u20136 (3:23\u201324 in [[Hebrew]]) as the basis for claiming the Elijah spirit would return.{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}} His belief in a \"seventh church age messenger\" came from his interpretation of the Book of Revelation 3:14\u201322.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=79}}{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nBranham preached another sermon in 1963, further indicating he was a prophet who had the anointing of Elijah and was a messenger heralding the second coming of Christ.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99, 128}} Branham did not directly claim to be the end-time messenger in either of his sermons.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=128}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=174}} Weaver believed Branham desired to be the eschatological prophet he was preaching about,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=128}} but had self-doubt.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=133}} Branham left the identity of the messenger open to the interpretation of his followers, who widely accepted that he was that messenger.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=133}}\n\nBranham regarded his 1963 series of sermons on the [[Seven Seals]] as a highlight of his ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99\u2013100}} According to Weaver, they were primarily \"a restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=101}} The sermons focused on the Book of Revelation 6:1\u201317, and provided an interpretation of the meaning of each of the seals.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99\u2013100}} Branham claimed the sermons were inspired through an angelic visitation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n====Anti-denominationalism====\n\nBranham believed [[denominationalism]] was \"a [[Number of the beast|mark of the beast]]\", which added to the controversy surrounding his later ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}}{{efn|Weaver records Branham believed it was \"''the'' mark of the beast\", whereas Harrell records he believed it was \"''a'' mark of the beast\".}} Branham was not opposed to organizational structures; his concern focused on the \"road block to salvation and spiritual unity\" he believed denominations created by emphasizing loyalty to their organizations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}}\n\nBranham's doctrine was similar to the [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] rhetoric of classical Pentecostalism and Protestantism, which commonly associated the mark of the beast with [[Catholicism]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=115}} Branham, though, uniquely associated the image of the beast with Protestant denominations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=116}} In his later years, he came to believe all denominations were \"synagogues of Satan\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=117}} A key teaching of Branham's message was a command to true Christians to \"come out\" of the denominations and accept the message of the Laodicean messenger, who had the \"message of the hour\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=116\u2013117}} He argued that continued allegiance to a denomination was an acceptance of the mark of the beast, which would mean missing the rapture.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n====Prophecies====\n\nBranham issued a series of prophecies during his ministry. He claimed to have had a prophetic revelation in June 1933 that predicted seven major events would occur before the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=29}} His followers believe he predicted several events, including the [[1937 Ohio River Flood]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=22}} In 1964, Branham said judgement would strike the west coast of the United States and that Los Angeles would sink into the ocean; his most dramatic prediction.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Following both the 1933 and 1964 prophecies, Branham predicted the rapture would happen by 1977 and would be preceded by various worldwide disasters, the unification of denominational Christianity, and the rise-to-power of the Roman Catholic Pope.{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}} Peter Duyzer, among other of Branham's critics, wrote that either none of Branham's prophecies came true or that they were all made after the fact.{{sfn|Duyzer|2014|pp=61\u201383}} Weaver wrote that Branham tended to embellish his predictions over time.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=30\u201331}}{{efn|In December 1964, Branham prophesied that Los Angeles would sink into the Pacific Ocean when struck by the [[The Day of the Lord|wrath of God]]; this prophecy was subsequently embellished into a prediction that an area of land {{Convert|1,500|miles|km}} long, {{Convert|300\u2013400|miles|km}} wide, and {{Convert|40|miles|km}} deep would break loose, causing waves that would \"shoot plumb out to Kentucky\".<ref>Weaver 2000, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>}} Branham's followers believe his prophecies came true, or will do so in the future.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=101}}\n\n====Restorationism====\n{{further|Restorationism}}\n\nOf all of Branham's doctrines, his teachings on Christian restorationism have had the most lasting impact on modern Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty described his teachings on the subject as \"extremely significant\" because they have \"impacted every major restoration movement since\".{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} As a result, Moriarty concluded Branham has \"profoundly influenced\" the modern Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=56}} Branham taught the doctrine widely from the early days of the healing revival, in which he urged his audiences to unite and restore a form of church organization like the primitive church of early Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}}  The teaching was accepted and widely taught by many of the evangelists of the healing revival, and they took it with them into the subsequent Charismatic and evangelical movements. [[Paul Cain (minister)|Paul Cain]], Bill Hamon, [[Kenneth Hagin]], and other restoration prophets cite Branham as a major influence; they played a critical role in introducing Branham's restoration views to the [[Apostolic-Prophetic Movement]], the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]], and other large Charismatic organizations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} The [[Toronto Blessing]], the [[Brownsville Revival]], and other nationwide revivals of the late 20th century have their roots in Branham's restorationist teachings.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}}\n\nThe teaching holds that Christianity should return to a form mirroring the primitive Christian church.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} It supports the restoration of apostles and prophets, [[signs and wonders]], spiritual gifts, [[spiritual warfare]], and the elimination of non-primitive features of modern Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} Branham taught that by the end of the first century of Christianity, the church \"had been contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit\".{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} As a result, he believed that from a very early date, the church had stopped following the \"pure Word of God\" and had been seduced into a false form of Christianity.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} He stated the corruption came from the desire of early Christianity's clergy to obtain political power, and as a result became increasingly wicked and introduced false creeds.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} This led to denominationalism, which he viewed as the greatest threat to true Christianity.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} Branham viewed [[Martin Luther]] as the initiator of a process that would result in the restoration of the true form of Christianity, and traced the advancement of the process through other historic church figures.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=54}} He believed the rapture would occur at the culmination of this process.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=54}} Although Branham referred in his sermons to the culmination of the process as a future event affecting other people, he believed he and his followers were fulfilling his restoration beliefs.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=55}}\n\n==Death==\nOn December 18, 1965, Branham and his family\u2014except his daughter Rebekah\u2014were returning to Jeffersonville, Indiana, from Tucson for the Christmas holiday.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} About {{Convert|3|miles|km|spell=in}} east of [[Friona, Texas]], and about {{Convert|70|miles|km|spell=in}} southwest of Amarillo on [[U.S. Route 60 in Texas|US Highway 60]], just after dark, a car driven by a drunken driver traveling westward in the eastbound lane collided head-on with Branham's car.<ref>{{cite news| author =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| title = Head-on Collision Kills 1, Injures 6| work= Friona Star| date = December 23, 1965 | location= Friona, Texas| page=3| hdl= 10605/243339|ref={{SfnRef|Friona Star|1965}}}}</ref> He was rushed to the hospital in Amarillo where he remained comatose for several days and died of his injuries on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1965.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}}\n\nBranham's death stunned the Pentecostal world and shocked his followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} His funeral was held on December 29, 1965,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} but his burial was delayed until April 11, 1966; Easter Monday.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} Most eulogies only tacitly acknowledged Branham's controversial teachings, focusing instead on his many positive contributions and recalled his wide popularity and impact during the years of the healing revival.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=105}} Gordon Lindsay's eulogy stated that Branham's death was the will of God and privately he accepted the interpretation of [[Kenneth E. Hagin]], who claimed to have prophesied Branham's death two years before it happened. According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing him because of his disobedience.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=105}}{{sfn|Liardon|2003|p=354}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}}\n\nIn the confusion immediately following Branham's death, expectations that he would rise from the dead developed among his followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=153\u2013154}} Most believed he would have to return to fulfill a vision he had regarding future tent meetings.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=153\u2013154}} Weaver attributed the belief in Branham's imminent resurrection to Pearry Green, though Green denied it.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=154}} Even Branham's son Billy Paul seemed to expect his father's resurrection and indicated as much in messages sent to Branham's followers, in which he communicated his expectation for Easter 1966.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=154}} The expectation of his resurrection remained strong into the 1970s, in part based on Branham's prediction that the rapture could occur by 1977.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=155}} After 1977, some of his followers abandoned his teachings.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=155}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nBranham was the \"initiator of the post-World War II healing revival\"{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=25}} and, along with Oral Roberts, was one of its most revered leaders.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=19}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=58}} Branham is most remembered for his use of the \"sign-gifts\" that awed the Pentecostal world.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=36}} According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, \"the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement.\"{{sfn|Sims|1996|p=195}} The many revivalists who attempted to emulate Branham during the 1950s spawned a generation of prominent Charismatic ministries.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=40}} Branham has been called the \"principal architect of restorationist thought\" of the Charismatic movement that emerged out of the healing revival.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}} The Charismatic view that the Christian church should return to a form like that of the early church has its roots in Branham's teachings during the healing revival period.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}} The belief is widely held in the modern Charismatic movement,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}} and the legacy of his restorationist teaching and ministering style is evident throughout televangelism and the Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=vi}}\n\nThe more controversial doctrines Branham espoused in the closing years of his ministry were rejected by the Charismatic movement, which viewed them as \"revelatory madness\".{{efn|Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty stated, \"Branham's aberrational teachings not only cultivated cultic fringe movements like the Latter Rain Movement and the Manifested Sons of God, but they also paved a pathway leading to false predictions, revelatory madness, doctrinal heresies, and a cultic following that treated his sermons as oral scriptures\".<ref>Moriarty 1992, p. 55.</ref>}} Charismatics are apologetic towards Branham's early ministry and embrace his use of the \"sign-gifts\". Charismatic author John Crowder wrote that his ministry should not be judged by \"the small sliver of his later life\", but by the fact that he indirectly \"lit a fire\" that began the modern Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=330}} Non-Charismatic Christianity completely rejected Branham.{{efn|Hanegraaff in ''[[Hank Hanegraaff#Counterfeit Revival|Counterfeit Revival]]'' condemned the entire evangelical movement as a cult and singled out Branham, saying his \"failed prophecies were exceeded only by his false doctrine\" in infamy.<ref>Hanegraaf 2001, p. 152.</ref>}}\n\nCrowder said Branham was a victim of \"the adoration of man\" because his followers began to idolize him in the later part of his ministry.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=331}} Harrell took a similar view, attributing Branham's teachings in his later career to his close friends, who manipulated him and took advantage of his lack of theological training.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}} Weaver also attributed Branham's eschatological teachings to the influence of a small group of his closest followers, who encouraged his desire for a unique ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=102}}  According to Weaver, to Branham's dismay,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} his followers had placed him at the \"center of a Pentecostal personality cult\" in the final years of his ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=x}} Edward Babinski describes Branham's followers as \"odd in their beliefs, but for the most part honest hard-working citizens\", and wrote that calling them a cult \"seems unfair\".{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}} While rejecting Branham's teachings, Duyzer offered a glowing review of Branham's followers, stating he \"had never experienced friendship, or love like we did there\".{{sfn|Duyzer|2014|p=1}}\n\nThough Branham is no longer widely known outside Pentecostalism,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=x}} his legacy continues today.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=79}} Summarizing the contrasting views held of Branham, Kydd stated, \"Some thought he was God. Some thought he was a dupe of the devil.

He left a lasting impact on [[televangelism]] and the modern [[Charismatic movement]] and is recognized as the \"principal architect of [[restorationism|restorationist]] thought\" for Charismatics by some Christian historians.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=119}} At the time they were held, his inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American [[Deliverance ministry|deliverance minister]] to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed to have received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame spread rapidly as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set in motion the broader healing revival that later became the modern Charismatic movement. From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [[Pentecostal]] churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings known as the [[Full Gospel]] tradition, Branham developed an alternate theology that was primarily a mixture of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [[dispensationalism]] and Branham's own unique [[Eschatology|eschatological]] views. While widely accepting the [[Restorationism|restoration]] doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his Charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=55}} Many of his followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral scripture and refer to his teachings as The Message. In 1963, Branham preached a sermon in which he indicated he was a prophet with the anointing of [[Elijah]], who had come to herald [[Second Coming|Christ's second coming]]. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [[cult of personality]] during his final years. Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted through the William Branham Evangelistic Association, who reported in 2018 that about 2 million people receive their material. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Birthplace of William Branham as shown in William Branham A Man Sent From God 1950.jpg|alt=A log cabin with some logs missing and a lean-to attached to its side|thumb|right|The dirt-floor log cabin that was William Branham's birthplace as shown in his biography ''William Branham: A Man Sent From God'']]\n\nWilliam M.

Bosworth usually filled this role, but other ministers also participated in Branham's campaigns.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=32}} Baxter generally focused on bible teaching; Bosworth counseled supplicants on the need for faith and the doctrine of divine healing.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=68}}  Following their build-up, Branham would take the podium and deliver a short sermon,{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=32}} in which he usually related stories about his personal life experiences.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=38}}  After completing his sermon, he would proceed with a prayer line where he would pray for the sick.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=36}} Branham would often request God to \"confirm his message with two-or-three faith inspired miracles\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=68}}  His campaign manager organized the prayer line, sending supplicants forward to be prayed for on stage individually.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=68}} Branham generally prayed for a few people each night and believed witnessing the results on the stage would inspire faith in the audience and permit them to experience similar results without having to be personally prayed for.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=70}} Describing Branham's method, Bosworth said \"he does not begin to pray for the healing of the afflicted in body in the healing line each night until God anoints him for the operation of the gift, and until he is conscious of the presence of the Angel with him on the platform. Without this consciousness he seems to be perfectly helpless.\"{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=37}}\n\nBranham told audiences the angel that commissioned his ministry had given him two signs by which they could prove his commission.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=37}} He described the first sign as vibrations he felt in his hand when he touched a sick person's hand, which communicated to him the nature of the illness, but did not guarantee healing.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=37}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=51}}  Branham's use of what his fellow evangelists called a [[word of knowledge]] gift separated him from his contemporaries.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=324}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=38}}  This second sign did not appear in his campaigns until after his recovery in 1948, and was used to \"amaze tens of thousands\" at his meetings.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=38}}  According to Bosworth, this gift of knowledge allowed Branham \"to see and enable him to tell the many events of [people's] lives from their childhood down to the present\".{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=38}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=50}} This caused many in the healing revival to view Branham as a \"seer like the old testament prophets\".{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=38}} Branham amazed even fellow evangelists, which served to further push him into a legendary status in the movement.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=38}} Branham's audiences were often awestruck by the events during his meetings.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=36}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=40}} At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=39}}\n\n====Opposition====\nBranham faced criticism and opposition from the early days of the healing campaign.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=172}} According to historian Ronald Kydd, Branham evoked strong opinions from people with whom he came into contact; \"most people either loved him or hated him\".{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=178}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=180}} In 1947, Rev. Alfred Pohl, a minister in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, stated that many people Branham pronounced as healed later died.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=172}} A year later, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the [[Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada]], raised the same concern and asked for a thorough investigation.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=35}} Taylor presented evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=173}} He stated, \"there is a possibility that this whole thing is wrong\".{{sfn|Kydd|1998|pp=172\u2013173}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=35}} The number of people who claimed to be healed in Branham's campaign meetings \"is impossible to approximate\" and the numbers vary greatly between sources.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=179}} According to Kydd, by watching films of the revival meetings, \"the viewer would assume almost everyone was healed\" but the results proved otherwise the few times follow-up was made.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=180}} No consistent record of follow-ups was made, making analysis of the claims difficult to subsequent researchers.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=180}} Pentecostal historian [[Walter Hollenweger]] said, \"very few were actually healed\".{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}} Some attendees of Branham's meetings believed the healings were a hoax and accused him of selectively choosing who could enter the prayer line.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=72}} Some people left his meetings disappointed after finding Branham's conviction that everyone in the audience could be healed without being in the prayer line proved incorrect.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=72}} Branham generally attributed the failure of supplicants to receive healing to their lack of faith.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=71}}\n\nThe \"word of knowledge\" gift was likewise subject to much criticism.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=178}} Hollenweger investigated Branham's use of the \"word of knowledge gift\" and found no instances in which Branham was mistaken in his often-detailed pronouncements.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=178}} Criticism of Branham's use of this gift was primarily around its nature; some accused him of [[witchcraft]] and [[telepathy]].{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=180}} Branham was openly confronted with such criticisms and rejected the assertions.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=180}}\n\n===Growing fame===\n[[File:William M.

Crowder suggested Branham's gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=330}} Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=40}} Weaver agreed Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for the healing revival, mainly over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=92}} The [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]] were the first to openly withdraw support from the healing revival in 1953.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=92}} Weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy the initial [[ecumenism]] of the revival; tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists' fund-raising methods, denominational pride, sensationalism, and doctrinal conflicts\u2014particularly between the [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=92}}\n\n==Later life==\n===Teaching ministry===\n\nAs the healing revival began to wane, many of Branham's contemporaries moved into the leadership of the emerging Charismatic movement, which emphasized use of spiritual gifts.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=93}} The Charismatic movement is a global movement within both Protestant and non-Protestant Christianity that supports the adoption of traditionally Pentecostal beliefs, especially the spiritual gifts ([[Spiritual gift|charismata]]). The movement began in the teachings of the healing revival evangelists and grew as their teachings came to receive broad acceptance among millions of Christians.<ref>Grenz, p. 162.</ref> At the same time the Charismatic movement was gaining broad acceptance, Branham began to transition to a teaching ministry. He began speaking on the controversial doctrinal issues he had avoided for most of the revival.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=173}} By the 1960s, Branham's contemporaries and the Pentecostal denominations that had supported his campaigns regarded him as an extremely controversial teacher.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}} The leadership of the Pentecostal churches pressed Branham to resist his urge to teach and to instead focus on praying for the sick.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=108}} Branham refused, arguing that the purpose of his healing ministry was to attract audiences and, having thus been attracted, it was time to teach them the doctrines he claimed to have received through supernatural revelation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=108\u2013109}} Branham argued that his entire ministry was divinely inspired and could not be selectively rejected or accepted, saying, \"It's either all of God, or none of God\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=108}}\n\nAt first, Branham taught his doctrines only within his own church at Jeffersonville, but beginning in the 1960s he began to preach them at other churches he visited.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=108}} His criticisms of Pentecostal organizations, and especially his views on holiness and the role of women, led to his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement and the Pentecostals from whom he had originally achieved popularity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=97}} Branham acknowledged their rejection and said their organizations \"had choked out the glory and Spirit of God\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=97}}  As a result of their view of his teachings, many Pentecostals judged that Branham had \"stepped out of his anointing\" and had become a \"bad teacher of heretical doctrine\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=140}}\n\nDespite his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement, Branham's followers became increasingly dedicated to him during his later life; some even claimed he was the [[Messiah]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Branham quickly condemned their belief as heresy and threatened to stop ministering, but the belief persisted.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Many followers moved great distances to live near his home in Jeffersonville and, led by Leo Mercer, subsequently set up a colony in Arizona following Branham's move to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in 1962.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Branham lamented Mercer and the actions of his group as he worried that a cult was potentially being formed among his most fanatical followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}}\n\nBranham continued to travel to churches and preach his doctrine across North America during the 1960s. He held his final set of revival meetings in Shreveport at the church of his early campaign manager Jack Moore in November 1965.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}}\n\n===Teachings===\n\nBranham developed a unique theology and placed emphasis on a few key doctrines, including his [[eschatology|eschatological]] views, [[annihilationism]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism|oneness of the Godhead]], [[predestination]], [[Perseverance of the saints|eternal security]], and the [[Serpent seed|serpent's seed]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=118, 98}} His followers refer to his teachings collectively as \"The Message\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}} Kydd and Weaver have both referred to Branham's teachings as \"Branhamology\".{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=176}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}} Most of Branham's teachings have precedents within sects of the Pentecostal movement or in other non-Pentecostal denominations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}} The doctrines Branham imported from non-Pentecostal theology and the unique combination of doctrines that he created as a result led to widespread criticism from Pentecostal churches and the Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}} His unique arrangement of doctrines, coupled with the highly controversial nature of the serpent seed doctrine, caused the alienation of many of his former supporters.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nThe [[Full Gospel]] tradition, which has its roots in [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]], is the theology generally adhered to by the Charismatic movement and Pentecostal denominations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}} Branham's doctrines are a blend of both [[Calvinism]] and [[Arminianism]], which are considered contradictory by many theologians.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=121}} As a result, his theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally during the years of the healing revival.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}} Many of his followers regard his sermons as oral scripture and believe Branham had rediscovered the true doctrines of the early church.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=118}}\n\n====Divine healing====\n{{further|Faith healing#Christianity|Deliverance ministry}}\n\nThroughout his ministry, Branham taught a doctrine of faith healing that was often the central teaching he espoused during the healing campaign.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} He believed healing was the main focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and believed in a dual [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]; \"salvation for the soul and healing for the body\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} He believed and taught that miracles ascribed to Christ in the New Testament were also possible in modern times.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} Branham believed all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by the faith of the person desiring healing.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} Branham argued that God was required to heal when faith was present.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} This led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}} Branham's teaching on divine healing were within the mainstream of Pentecostal theology and echoed the doctrines taught by [[Smith Wigglesworth]], Bosworth, and other prominent Pentecostal ministers of the prior generation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=86}}\n\n====Annihilationism====\n{{further|Annihilationism}}\n\nAnnihilationism, the doctrine that the damned will be totally destroyed after the final judgment so as to not exist, was introduced to Pentecostalism in the teachings of [[Charles Fox Parham]] (1873\u20131929).{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=117\u2013118}} Not all Pentecostal sects accepted the idea.<ref>Douglas Gordon Jacobsen.

Richard Niebuhr|Christ against Culture]]\" opinion,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}} according to which loyalty to Christ requires rejection of non-Christian culture; an opinion not unique to Branham.{{sfn|Niebuhr|1975|p=45}}\n\nPentecostalism inherited the Wesleyan doctrine of [[entire sanctification]] and [[outward holiness]] from its founders, who came from Wesleyan-influenced denominations of the post-[[American Civil War]] era.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=17, 41}} The rigid moral code associated with the holiness movement had been widely accepted by Pentecostals in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=109, 111}}  Branham's strict moral code echoed the traditions of early Pentecostalism{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} but became increasingly unpopular because he refused to accommodate mid-century Pentecostalism's shifting viewpoint.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}} He denounced [[cigarettes]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[television]], [[rock and roll]], and many forms of worldly amusement.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}}\n\nBranham strongly identified with the lower-class roots of Pentecostalism and advocated an [[Asceticism#Christianity|ascetic lifestyle]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} When he was given a new [[Cadillac]], he kept it parked in his garage for two years out of embarrassment.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} Branham openly chastised other evangelists, who seemed to be growing wealthy from their ministries and opposed the prosperity messages being taught.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} Branham did not view financial prosperity as an automatic result of salvation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} He rejected the [[prosperity gospel]] that originated in the teachings of [[Oral Roberts]] and [[A.&nbsp;A. Allen]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} Branham condemned any emphasis on expensive church buildings, elaborate choir robes, and large salaries for ministers, and insisted the church should focus on the imminent return of Christ.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=169}}\n\nBranham's opposition to modern culture emerged most strongly in his condemnation of the \"immorality of modern women\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=109}} He taught that women with [[short hair]] were breaking God's commandments and according to Weaver, \"ridiculed women's desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=110}} Branham believed women were guilty of committing adultery if their appearance was intended to motivate men to lust, and viewed a woman's place as \"in the kitchen\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=110}} Citing the creation story in which Eve is taken from [[Adam's Rib|Adam's side]], Branham taught that woman was a byproduct of man.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} According to Weaver, \"his pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory\" and he regularly offered glowing praise of women.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} Weaver stated that Branham \"once told women who wore [[shorts]] not to call themselves Christians\" but qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to the [[outward holiness|holiness moral code]] was not a requirement for salvation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} Branham did not condemn women who refused the holiness moral code to [[Hell]], but he insisted they would not be part of the [[rapture]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}}\n\nWeaver wrote that Branham's attitude to women concerning physical appearance, sexual drive, and marital relations was misogynistic,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=112}} and that Branham saw modern women as \"essentially immoral sexual machines who were to blame for adultery, divorce and death. They were the tools of the Devil.\"{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}} Some of Branham's contemporaries accused him of being a \"woman hater\", but he insisted he only hated immorality.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}} According to [[Edward Babinski]], women who follow the holiness moral code Branham supported regard it as \"a badge of honor\".{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}}\n\n====Serpent's seed====\n{{further|Serpent Seed|Original Sin}}\nBranham taught an unorthodox doctrine of the source of [[original sin]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}} He believed the story of the [[fall of man]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] is allegorical and interpreted it to mean the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] had sexual intercourse with Eve and that their offspring was [[Cain]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=98}} Branham taught that Cain's modern descendants were masquerading as educated people and scientists,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=113}} and that Cain's descendants were \"a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children\"{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=125}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=50}} who comprised the majority of society's criminals.{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=174}} He believed the serpent was the [[Transitional fossil|missing link]] between the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] and man, and speculated that the serpent was possibly a human-like giant.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=124}} Branham held the belief that the serpent was transformed into a reptile after it was cursed by God.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=124}} Weaver commented on Branham's interpretation of the story; \"Consequently every woman potentially carried the literal seed of the devil\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=111}}\n\nBranham first spoke about original sin in 1958; he rejected the orthodox view of the subject and hinted at his own belief in a hidden meaning to the story.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} In later years, he made his opinion concerning the sexual nature of the fall explicitly known.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} Weaver wrote that Branham may have become acquainted with serpent's seed doctrine through his Baptist roots; [[Daniel Parker (Baptist)|Daniel Parker]], an American Baptist minister from Kentucky, promulgated a [[Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists|similar doctrine]] in the mid-1800s.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=125}} According to Pearry Green, Branham's teaching on the serpent's seed doctrine was viewed by the broader Pentecostal movement as the \"filthy doctrine&nbsp;... that ruined his ministry\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} No other mainstream Christian group held a similar view; Branham was widely criticized for spreading the doctrine.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}} His followers view the doctrine as one of his greatest revelations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=123}}\n\n====Eschatology====\n\nIn 1960, Branham preached a series of sermons on the [[Seven churches of Asia|seven church ages]] based on chapters two and three of the [[Book of Revelation]]. The sermons closely aligned with the teachings of [[C. I. Scofield]] and [[Clarence Larkin]], the leading proponents of [[dispensationalism]] in the preceding generation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99, 103}} Like Larkin and Scofield, Branham said each church represents a historical age, and taught that the angel of each age was a significant church figure.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=99}} The message included the description of a messenger to the [[Laodicean Church]] age, which Branham believed would immediately precede the rapture.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=99}} Branham explained the Laodicean age would be immoral in a way comparable to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and it would be a time in which Christian denominations rejected Christ.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=129\u2013130}}  As described by Branham, the characteristics of the Laodicean age resemble those of the modern era.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=99}} Branham described the characteristics of the Laodicean messenger by comparing his traits to [[Elijah]] and [[John the Baptist]]. He asserted the messenger would be a mighty prophet who put the Word of God first, that he would be a lover of the wilderness, that he would hate wicked women, and be an uneducated person.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=129}}  Branham claimed the messenger to this last age would come in the spirit of Elijah the prophet and cited the [[Book of Malachi]] 4:5\u20136 (3:23\u201324 in [[Hebrew]]) as the basis for claiming the Elijah spirit would return.{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}} His belief in a \"seventh church age messenger\" came from his interpretation of the Book of Revelation 3:14\u201322.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=79}}{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}}{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nBranham preached another sermon in 1963, further indicating he was a prophet who had the anointing of Elijah and was a messenger heralding the second coming of Christ.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99, 128}} Branham did not directly claim to be the end-time messenger in either of his sermons.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=128}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=174}} Weaver believed Branham desired to be the eschatological prophet he was preaching about,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=128}} but had self-doubt.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=133}} Branham left the identity of the messenger open to the interpretation of his followers, who widely accepted that he was that messenger.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=133}}\n\nBranham regarded his 1963 series of sermons on the [[Seven Seals]] as a highlight of his ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99\u2013100}} According to Weaver, they were primarily \"a restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=101}} The sermons focused on the Book of Revelation 6:1\u201317, and provided an interpretation of the meaning of each of the seals.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99\u2013100}} Branham claimed the sermons were inspired through an angelic visitation.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n====Anti-denominationalism====\n\nBranham believed [[denominationalism]] was \"a [[Number of the beast|mark of the beast]]\", which added to the controversy surrounding his later ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}}{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}}{{efn|Weaver records Branham believed it was \"''the'' mark of the beast\", whereas Harrell records he believed it was \"''a'' mark of the beast\".}} Branham was not opposed to organizational structures; his concern focused on the \"road block to salvation and spiritual unity\" he believed denominations created by emphasizing loyalty to their organizations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=114}}\n\nBranham's doctrine was similar to the [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] rhetoric of classical Pentecostalism and Protestantism, which commonly associated the mark of the beast with [[Catholicism]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=115}} Branham, though, uniquely associated the image of the beast with Protestant denominations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=116}} In his later years, he came to believe all denominations were \"synagogues of Satan\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=117}} A key teaching of Branham's message was a command to true Christians to \"come out\" of the denominations and accept the message of the Laodicean messenger, who had the \"message of the hour\".{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=116\u2013117}} He argued that continued allegiance to a denomination was an acceptance of the mark of the beast, which would mean missing the rapture.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n====Prophecies====\n\nBranham issued a series of prophecies during his ministry. He claimed to have had a prophetic revelation in June 1933 that predicted seven major events would occur before the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=29}} His followers believe he predicted several events, including the [[1937 Ohio River Flood]].{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=22}} In 1964, Branham said judgement would strike the west coast of the United States and that Los Angeles would sink into the ocean; his most dramatic prediction.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} Following both the 1933 and 1964 prophecies, Branham predicted the rapture would happen by 1977 and would be preceded by various worldwide disasters, the unification of denominational Christianity, and the rise-to-power of the Roman Catholic Pope.{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}} Peter Duyzer, among other of Branham's critics, wrote that either none of Branham's prophecies came true or that they were all made after the fact.{{sfn|Duyzer|2014|pp=61\u201383}} Weaver wrote that Branham tended to embellish his predictions over time.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=30\u201331}}{{efn|In December 1964, Branham prophesied that Los Angeles would sink into the Pacific Ocean when struck by the [[The Day of the Lord|wrath of God]]; this prophecy was subsequently embellished into a prediction that an area of land {{Convert|1,500|miles|km}} long, {{Convert|300\u2013400|miles|km}} wide, and {{Convert|40|miles|km}} deep would break loose, causing waves that would \"shoot plumb out to Kentucky\".<ref>Weaver 2000, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>}} Branham's followers believe his prophecies came true, or will do so in the future.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=101}}\n\n====Restorationism====\n{{further|Restorationism}}\n\nOf all of Branham's doctrines, his teachings on Christian restorationism have had the most lasting impact on modern Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty described his teachings on the subject as \"extremely significant\" because they have \"impacted every major restoration movement since\".{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} As a result, Moriarty concluded Branham has \"profoundly influenced\" the modern Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=56}} Branham taught the doctrine widely from the early days of the healing revival, in which he urged his audiences to unite and restore a form of church organization like the primitive church of early Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}}  The teaching was accepted and widely taught by many of the evangelists of the healing revival, and they took it with them into the subsequent Charismatic and evangelical movements. [[Paul Cain (minister)|Paul Cain]], Bill Hamon, [[Kenneth Hagin]], and other restoration prophets cite Branham as a major influence; they played a critical role in introducing Branham's restoration views to the [[Apostolic-Prophetic Movement]], the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]], and other large Charismatic organizations.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} The [[Toronto Blessing]], the [[Brownsville Revival]], and other nationwide revivals of the late 20th century have their roots in Branham's restorationist teachings.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}}\n\nThe teaching holds that Christianity should return to a form mirroring the primitive Christian church.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} It supports the restoration of apostles and prophets, [[signs and wonders]], spiritual gifts, [[spiritual warfare]], and the elimination of non-primitive features of modern Christianity.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=v\u2013vi}} Branham taught that by the end of the first century of Christianity, the church \"had been contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit\".{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} As a result, he believed that from a very early date, the church had stopped following the \"pure Word of God\" and had been seduced into a false form of Christianity.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} He stated the corruption came from the desire of early Christianity's clergy to obtain political power, and as a result became increasingly wicked and introduced false creeds.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} This led to denominationalism, which he viewed as the greatest threat to true Christianity.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=53}} Branham viewed [[Martin Luther]] as the initiator of a process that would result in the restoration of the true form of Christianity, and traced the advancement of the process through other historic church figures.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=54}} He believed the rapture would occur at the culmination of this process.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=54}} Although Branham referred in his sermons to the culmination of the process as a future event affecting other people, he believed he and his followers were fulfilling his restoration beliefs.{{sfn|Moriarty|1992|p=55}}\n\n==Death==\nOn December 18, 1965, Branham and his family\u2014except his daughter Rebekah\u2014were returning to Jeffersonville, Indiana, from Tucson for the Christmas holiday.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} About {{Convert|3|miles|km|spell=in}} east of [[Friona, Texas]], and about {{Convert|70|miles|km|spell=in}} southwest of Amarillo on [[U.S. Route 60 in Texas|US Highway 60]], just after dark, a car driven by a drunken driver traveling westward in the eastbound lane collided head-on with Branham's car.<ref>{{cite news| author =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| title = Head-on Collision Kills 1, Injures 6| work= Friona Star| date = December 23, 1965 | location= Friona, Texas| page=3| hdl= 10605/243339|ref={{SfnRef|Friona Star|1965}}}}</ref> He was rushed to the hospital in Amarillo where he remained comatose for several days and died of his injuries on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1965.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=164}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}}\n\nBranham's death stunned the Pentecostal world and shocked his followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} His funeral was held on December 29, 1965,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} but his burial was delayed until April 11, 1966; Easter Monday.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=104}} Most eulogies only tacitly acknowledged Branham's controversial teachings, focusing instead on his many positive contributions and recalled his wide popularity and impact during the years of the healing revival.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=105}} Gordon Lindsay's eulogy stated that Branham's death was the will of God and privately he accepted the interpretation of [[Kenneth E. Hagin]], who claimed to have prophesied Branham's death two years before it happened. According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing him because of his disobedience.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=105}}{{sfn|Liardon|2003|p=354}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}}\n\nIn the confusion immediately following Branham's death, expectations that he would rise from the dead developed among his followers.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=153\u2013154}} Most believed he would have to return to fulfill a vision he had regarding future tent meetings.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|pp=153\u2013154}} Weaver attributed the belief in Branham's imminent resurrection to Pearry Green, though Green denied it.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=154}} Even Branham's son Billy Paul seemed to expect his father's resurrection and indicated as much in messages sent to Branham's followers, in which he communicated his expectation for Easter 1966.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=154}} The expectation of his resurrection remained strong into the 1970s, in part based on Branham's prediction that the rapture could occur by 1977.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=155}} After 1977, some of his followers abandoned his teachings.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=155}}{{sfn|Kydd|1998|p=175}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nBranham was the \"initiator of the post-World War II healing revival\"{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=25}} and, along with Oral Roberts, was one of its most revered leaders.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=19}}{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=58}} Branham is most remembered for his use of the \"sign-gifts\" that awed the Pentecostal world.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=36}} According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, \"the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement.\"{{sfn|Sims|1996|p=195}} The many revivalists who attempted to emulate Branham during the 1950s spawned a generation of prominent Charismatic ministries.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=40}} Branham has been called the \"principal architect of restorationist thought\" of the Charismatic movement that emerged out of the healing revival.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}} The Charismatic view that the Christian church should return to a form like that of the early church has its roots in Branham's teachings during the healing revival period.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}} The belief is widely held in the modern Charismatic movement,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=v}} and the legacy of his restorationist teaching and ministering style is evident throughout televangelism and the Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=vi}}\n\nThe more controversial doctrines Branham espoused in the closing years of his ministry were rejected by the Charismatic movement, which viewed them as \"revelatory madness\".{{efn|Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty stated, \"Branham's aberrational teachings not only cultivated cultic fringe movements like the Latter Rain Movement and the Manifested Sons of God, but they also paved a pathway leading to false predictions, revelatory madness, doctrinal heresies, and a cultic following that treated his sermons as oral scriptures\".<ref>Moriarty 1992, p. 55.</ref>}} Charismatics are apologetic towards Branham's early ministry and embrace his use of the \"sign-gifts\". Charismatic author John Crowder wrote that his ministry should not be judged by \"the small sliver of his later life\", but by the fact that he indirectly \"lit a fire\" that began the modern Charismatic movement.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=330}} Non-Charismatic Christianity completely rejected Branham.{{efn|Hanegraaff in ''[[Hank Hanegraaff#Counterfeit Revival|Counterfeit Revival]]'' condemned the entire evangelical movement as a cult and singled out Branham, saying his \"failed prophecies were exceeded only by his false doctrine\" in infamy.<ref>Hanegraaf 2001, p. 152.</ref>}}\n\nCrowder said Branham was a victim of \"the adoration of man\" because his followers began to idolize him in the later part of his ministry.{{sfn|Crowder|2006|p=331}} Harrell took a similar view, attributing Branham's teachings in his later career to his close friends, who manipulated him and took advantage of his lack of theological training.{{sfn|Harrell|1978|p=163}} Weaver also attributed Branham's eschatological teachings to the influence of a small group of his closest followers, who encouraged his desire for a unique ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=102}}  According to Weaver, to Branham's dismay,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=103}} his followers had placed him at the \"center of a Pentecostal personality cult\" in the final years of his ministry.{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=x}} Edward Babinski describes Branham's followers as \"odd in their beliefs, but for the most part honest hard-working citizens\", and wrote that calling them a cult \"seems unfair\".{{sfn|Babinski|1995|p=277}} While rejecting Branham's teachings, Duyzer offered a glowing review of Branham's followers, stating he \"had never experienced friendship, or love like we did there\".{{sfn|Duyzer|2014|p=1}}\n\nThough Branham is no longer widely known outside Pentecostalism,{{sfn|Weaver|2000|p=x}} his legacy continues today.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=79}} Summarizing the contrasting views held of Branham, Kydd stated, \"Some thought he was God.

Codeine is more commonly used; however, as codeine is, in essence, a [[prodrug]] that requires ''[[in vivo]]'' [[Drug metabolism|metabolism]] (to [[morphine]] via [[demethylation]]) for efficacy, it is ineffective for some individuals with the \"poor metabolizer\" genotype of the liver [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. In people with this low-function isoform, dextropropoxyphene is particularly useful, as its metabolism does not require CYP2D6. It is also used for patients with digestive complaints, as it is less liable to worsen their symptoms.\n\n===Restless legs syndrome===\nDextropropoxyphene has been found to be helpful in relieving the symptoms of [[restless legs syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/restless-legs-syndrome |title=Restless legs syndrome: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepmedicinecenters.com/Home/SleepDisorders/RestlessLegsSyndrome |title=Restless Leg Syndrome - Sleep Medicine Centers of WNY |publisher=Sleepmedicinecenters.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rls.org/Document.Doc?&id=3 |work=Restless Leg Syndrome Foundation |title=Causes, diagnosis and treatment for the patient living with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902202608/http://www.rls.org/Document.Doc?&id=3 |archive-date=2 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Opioid withdrawal===\nIn pure form, dextropropoxyphene is commonly used to ease the [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms in people addicted to opioids. Being very weak in comparison to commonly abused opioids, dextropropoxyphene can only act as a \"partial\" substitute. It does not have much effect on mental cravings, but it can be effective in alleviating physical withdrawal effects, such as muscle cramps.\n\n===Contraindications===\nDextropropoxyphene is contraindicated in patients [[allergy|allergic]] to paracetamol (acetaminophen) or dextropropoxyphene, and in [[alcoholism|alcoholics]]. It is not intended for use in patients who are prone to suicide, anxiety, panic, or addiction.\n\n===Side effects===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n*Constipation\n*Itching\n*Drowsiness\n*Sore throat\n*Impaired alertness\n*Confusion\n*Serious or fatal heart rhythms\n*Nausea\n[[Image:propoxyphene.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[Image:propoxyphene2.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n== Pharmacology ==\n\nDextropropoxyphene acts as a [[mu-opioid receptor]] [[agonist]]. It also acts as a potent, [[noncompetitive]] [[alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor|\u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>4</sub>]] neuronal [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] [[nicotinic antagonist|antagonist]],<ref name=\"urlBlockade of Rat \u03b13\u03b24 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs \u2014 JPET\">{{cite web | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/299/1/366.abstract | title = Blockade of Rat \u03b13\u03b24 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs \u2014 JPET | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> as well as a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]].\n\n==Toxicity==\nOverdose is commonly broken into two categories - [[liver]] toxicity (from [[paracetamol poisoning]]) and dextropropoxyphene overdose.\n\nAn overdose of dextropropoxyphene may lead to various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation is responsible for the [[CNS depression]], [[respiratory depression]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[miosis]], and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]- or [[thought]]-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose increases CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/017078s048lbl.pdf|title=Dexedrine\u00ae (dextroamphetamine sulfate) Spansule\u00ae sustained release capsules [Label]|last=|first=|website=US Food and Drug Administration|publisher=Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC|date=February 2015|access-date=November 11, 2016|quote=In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, both propoxyphene and its metabolite [[norpropoxyphene]] have local [[anesthetic]] effects at concentrations about 10 times those necessary for opioid effects. Norpropoxyphene is a more potent local anesthetic than propoxyphene, and they are both more potent than [[lidocaine]].<ref name=Nickander1>Nickander ''et al.'', 1984</ref> Local anesthetic activity appears to be responsible for the [[arrhythmias]] and cardiovascular depression seen in propoxyphene poisoning.<ref name=Strom1/>\n\nBoth propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent blockers of cardiac membrane [[sodium channels]], and are more potent than lidocaine, [[quinidine]], and [[procainamide]] in this respect.<ref name=Holland1>Holland & Steinberg, 1979</ref> As a result, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene appear to have the characteristics of a [[Antiarrhythmic agent#Class Ic agents|Vaughn-Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic]].\n\nThese direct cardiac effects include decreased [[heart rate]] (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased [[contractility]], and decreased [[electrical conductivity]] (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects appear to be due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by [[naloxone]].<ref name=Nickander1/><ref name=Strom1>Strom ''et al.'', 1985b</ref><ref name=Bredgaard1>Bredgaard, Sorensen ''et al.'', 1984</ref> Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and [[sodium bicarbonate]] therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS dysrhythmia.<ref name=Stork1>Stork ''et al.'', 1995</ref>\n\n[[Seizure]]s may result from either opioid or local anesthetic effects.<ref name=Nickander1/> [[Pulmonary edema]] may result from direct [[pulmonary toxicity]], [[neurogenic]]/[[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] effects, or cardiovascular depression.<ref name=Strom1/>\n\n[[Balance disorder]] is possible, with risk of falls from standing height.\n\n==Available forms==\nPropoxyphene was initially introduced as propoxyphene hydrochloride. Shortly before the patent on propoxyphene expired, propoxyphene napsylate form was introduced to the market. Napsylate salt (the salt of [[Naphthalene#Substituted derivatives|naphthalenesulfonic acid]]) is claimed to be less prone to abuse, because it is almost insoluble in water, so cannot be used for injection. Napsylate also gives lower peak blood level.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0-7817-3481-9|title=Wilson and Gisvold's textbook of organic medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|author1=Wilson, Charles Owens  |author2=Gisvold, John H|year=2004}}</ref> Because of different molecular mass, a dose of 100&nbsp;mg of propoxyphene napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that present in 65&nbsp;mg of propoxyphene hydrochloride.\n\nBefore the FDA-directed recall, dextropropoxyphene HCl was available in the United States as a prescription formulation with paracetamol (acetaminophen) in ratio from 30&nbsp;mg / 600&nbsp;mg to 100&nbsp;mg / 650&nbsp;mg (or 100&nbsp;mg / 325&nbsp;mg in the case of Balacet), respectively. These are usually named [[Darvocet]]. Darvon is a pure propoxyphene preparation that does not contain paracetamol.\n\nIn Australia, dextropropoxyphene is available on prescription, both as a combined product (32.5&nbsp;mg dextropropoxyphene per 325&nbsp;mg paracetamol branded as Di-gesic, Capadex, or Paradex; it is also available in pure form (100-mg capsules) known as Doloxene.\n\n==Drug testing==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nDetectable levels of propoxyphene/dextropropoxyphene may stay in a person's system for up to 9 days after last dose and can be tested for specifically in nonstandard urinalysis, but may remain in the body longer in minuscule amounts. Propoxyphene does not show up on standard opiate/opioid tests because it is not chemically related to opiates as part of the OPI or OPI 2000 panels, which detect morphine and related compounds. It is most closely related to [[methadone]].\n\n==Usage controversy and regulation==\n[[Image:Doloxen.jpg|thumb|right|Trade name: Doloxene (100 mg; dextropropoxyphene napsylate)]]\n\nDextropropoxyphene is subject to some controversy; while many [[physician]]s prescribe it for a wide range of mildly to moderately painful symptoms, as well as for treatment of [[diarrhea]], many others refuse to prescribe it, citing limited effectiveness. In addition, the [[therapeutic index]] of dextroproxyphene is relatively narrow.\n\nCaution should be used when administering dextropropoxyphene, particularly with children and the elderly and with patients who may be pregnant or breastfeeding; other reported problems include kidney, liver, or respiratory disorders, and prolonged use. Attention should be paid to concomitant use with tranquillizers, antidepressants, or excess alcohol.\n\nDarvon, a dextropropoxyphene formulation made by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], which had been on the market for 25 years, came under heavy fire in 1978 by consumer groups that said it was associated with [[suicide]]. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently, but Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} among doctors, pharmacists, and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol. After determining the risks outweigh the benefits, the USFDA requested physicians stop prescribing the drug. On November 19, 2010, the FDA announced that Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals agreed to withdraw Darvon and Darvocet in the United States, followed by manufacturers of dextropropoxyphene.<ref name=\"cnn101119\">[http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/19/fda.removes.drug/ \"FDA pulls common pain med off the market\"].

Codeine is more commonly used; however, as codeine is, in essence, a [[prodrug]] that requires ''[[in vivo]]'' [[Drug metabolism|metabolism]] (to [[morphine]] via [[demethylation]]) for efficacy, it is ineffective for some individuals with the \"poor metabolizer\" genotype of the liver [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. In people with this low-function isoform, dextropropoxyphene is particularly useful, as its metabolism does not require CYP2D6. It is also used for patients with digestive complaints, as it is less liable to worsen their symptoms.\n\n===Restless legs syndrome===\nDextropropoxyphene has been found to be helpful in relieving the symptoms of [[restless legs syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/restless-legs-syndrome |title=Restless legs syndrome: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepmedicinecenters.com/Home/SleepDisorders/RestlessLegsSyndrome |title=Restless Leg Syndrome - Sleep Medicine Centers of WNY |publisher=Sleepmedicinecenters.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rls.org/Document.Doc?&id=3 |work=Restless Leg Syndrome Foundation |title=Causes, diagnosis and treatment for the patient living with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902202608/http://www.rls.org/Document.Doc?&id=3 |archive-date=2 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Opioid withdrawal===\nIn pure form, dextropropoxyphene is commonly used to ease the [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms in people addicted to opioids. Being very weak in comparison to commonly abused opioids, dextropropoxyphene can only act as a \"partial\" substitute. It does not have much effect on mental cravings, but it can be effective in alleviating physical withdrawal effects, such as muscle cramps.\n\n===Contraindications===\nDextropropoxyphene is contraindicated in patients [[allergy|allergic]] to paracetamol (acetaminophen) or dextropropoxyphene, and in [[alcoholism|alcoholics]]. It is not intended for use in patients who are prone to suicide, anxiety, panic, or addiction.\n\n===Side effects===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n*Constipation\n*Itching\n*Drowsiness\n*Sore throat\n*Impaired alertness\n*Confusion\n*Serious or fatal heart rhythms\n*Nausea\n[[Image:propoxyphene.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[Image:propoxyphene2.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n== Pharmacology ==\n\nDextropropoxyphene acts as a [[mu-opioid receptor]] [[agonist]].

Excessive opioid receptor stimulation is responsible for the [[CNS depression]], [[respiratory depression]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[miosis]], and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]- or [[thought]]-altering effects.

Shortly before the patent on propoxyphene expired, propoxyphene napsylate form was introduced to the market. Napsylate salt (the salt of [[Naphthalene#Substituted derivatives|naphthalenesulfonic acid]]) is claimed to be less prone to abuse, because it is almost insoluble in water, so cannot be used for injection. Napsylate also gives lower peak blood level.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0-7817-3481-9|title=Wilson and Gisvold's textbook of organic medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|author1=Wilson, Charles Owens  |author2=Gisvold, John H|year=2004}}</ref> Because of different molecular mass, a dose of 100&nbsp;mg of propoxyphene napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that present in 65&nbsp;mg of propoxyphene hydrochloride.\n\nBefore the FDA-directed recall, dextropropoxyphene HCl was available in the United States as a prescription formulation with paracetamol (acetaminophen) in ratio from 30&nbsp;mg / 600&nbsp;mg to 100&nbsp;mg / 650&nbsp;mg (or 100&nbsp;mg / 325&nbsp;mg in the case of Balacet), respectively.

Propoxyphene does not show up on standard opiate/opioid tests because it is not chemically related to opiates as part of the OPI or OPI 2000 panels, which detect morphine and related compounds. It is most closely related to [[methadone]].\n\n==Usage controversy and regulation==\n[[Image:Doloxen.jpg|thumb|right|Trade name: Doloxene (100 mg; dextropropoxyphene napsylate)]]\n\nDextropropoxyphene is subject to some controversy; while many [[physician]]s prescribe it for a wide range of mildly to moderately painful symptoms, as well as for treatment of [[diarrhea]], many others refuse to prescribe it, citing limited effectiveness. In addition, the [[therapeutic index]] of dextroproxyphene is relatively narrow.\n\nCaution should be used when administering dextropropoxyphene, particularly with children and the elderly and with patients who may be pregnant or breastfeeding; other reported problems include kidney, liver, or respiratory disorders, and prolonged use. Attention should be paid to concomitant use with tranquillizers, antidepressants, or excess alcohol.\n\nDarvon, a dextropropoxyphene formulation made by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], which had been on the market for 25 years, came under heavy fire in 1978 by consumer groups that said it was associated with [[suicide]]. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently, but Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} among doctors, pharmacists, and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol.

Popov is considered one of [[Ian Fleming]]'s primary inspirations for the character of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]].\n\nPopov was born into a wealthy family and was a practicing lawyer at the start of the war. He held a great aversion to [[Nazism]], and in 1940, infiltrated the [[Abwehr]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s [[military intelligence]] service, which considered him a valuable asset due to his business connections in France and the United Kingdom. Popov provided the Germans with misleading and inaccurate information for much of the war. \n\nDeceptions in which he participated included [[Operation Fortitude]], which sought to convince German military planners that the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of Europe would take place in [[Calais]], not [[Normandy]], thereby diverting hundreds of thousands of German troops and increasing the likelihood that [[Operation Overlord]] would succeed.\n\nPopov was known for his promiscuous lifestyle and courted women during his missions, including the French actress [[Simone Simon]]. Apart from MI6 and the Abwehr, he also reported to the Yugoslav intelligence service, which assigned him the codename '''Du\u0161ko'''. His German handlers referred to him by the codename '''Ivan'''. He was codenamed '''Tricycle''' by the British MI5 because he was the head of a group of three double agents.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Operation Snow: How a Soviet Mole in FDR's White House Triggered Pearl Harbor|last=Koster|first=John|publisher=Regnery|year=2012|isbn=9781596983298|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1974, he published an autobiography titled ''Spy/Counterspy'', in which he recounted his wartime exploits.

Records from as early as 1773 describe them as the most affluent family there.<ref name=NovoMilosevo>{{cite document|script-title=sr:\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u040f\u0435\u0458\u043c\u0441 \u0411\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0443 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443|journal=\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0437\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433 \u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430|language=Serbian|volume=4|year=2007|location=Novo Milo\u0161evo|pp=98\u2013101|url=http://novomilosevo.devbin.org/download/mononmcetiricitaj.pdf}}</ref> Popov's father expanded the family's business interests to include real estate dealings.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=3}} When Popov was an infant, the family left Titel and permanently relocated to their summer residence in [[Dubrovnik]], which was their home for much of the year.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}} They also had a manor in [[Belgrade]], where they spent the winter months.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=3}}\n\nPopov's childhood coincided with a series of monumental political changes in the [[Balkans]]. In November 1918, Austria-Hungary disintegrated into a number of smaller states, and its Balkan possessions were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). The newly established, Serb-led state was plagued by political infighting among its various constitutive ethnic groups, particularly Serbs and [[Croats]], but also [[Hungarians]] and ethnic [[Germans]]. The young Popov and his family enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle and were far removed from the political turmoil in the country. They boasted a sizeable collection of [[villa]]s and yachts, and were attended by servants, even on their travels.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=13}} Du\u0161ko and his brothers spent most of their formative years along the [[Adriatic]] coast, and were avid athletes and outdoorsmen.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=3}}\n\nPopov's father indulged his sons, building a spacious villa by the sea for their exclusive use where they could entertain their friends and host expensive parties. He was also insistent that they receive a quality education. Apart from his native Serbian, Popov was fluent in Italian, German and French by his teenage years.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}} Between the ages of 12 and 16, he attended a ''[[Secondary education in France#Lyc\u00e9e|lyc\u00e9e]]'' in [[Paris]]. In 1929, Popov's father enrolled him into [[Ewell Castle School|Ewell Castle]], a prestigious [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[Surrey]]. Popov's stint at the school proved to be short lived. After only four months, he was expelled following an altercation with a teacher.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=4}} He had previously endured a [[caning]] at the teacher's hands after being caught smoking a cigarette. Another caning was adjudicated after Popov missed a [[school detention|detention]], and so as to evade further [[corporal punishment]], Popov grabbed the teacher's cane and snapped it in two before his classmates. Popov's father subsequently enrolled him at ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]]'', a secondary institution in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], which he attended for the following two years.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}}\n\n==Student activism==\nAt the age of 18, Popov enrolled in the [[University of Belgrade]], seeking an [[undergraduate degree]] in law. Over the next four years, he became a familiar face in Belgrade's cafes and nightclubs, and had the reputation of a [[wikt:lady's man|ladies' man]].{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=15}} \"Women&nbsp;... found him irresistible,\" ''[[The Times|Times]]'' columnist Ben Macintyre writes, \"with his easy manner, loose, sensual mouth&nbsp;... and green&nbsp;... bedroom eyes.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=7}} In 1934, Popov enrolled in the [[University of Freiburg]], intent on securing a doctorate in law. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had only recently come under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], but at the time, Popov paid little regard to politics. He had chosen Freiburg because it was relatively close to his native country and he was eager to improve his German-language skills. Germany was already the site of [[Nazi book burnings|mass book burnings]], the first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] had been established and the systematic persecution of [[Jews]] had commenced.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=15}}\n\nPopov began his studies at the University of Freiburg in the autumn of 1935, and in subsequent months, began showing greater interest in politics and voiced his political opinions more vigorously.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=9}} Around the same time, he befriended a fellow student, [[Johann Jebsen|Johnny Jebsen]], the son of a German shipping magnate. The two grew close, largely due to their raucous lifestyle and a shared interest in sports vehicles.{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=7}} In 1936\u201337, Popov began participating in debates at the ''Ausl\u00e4nder Club'', which were held every other Friday evening. He was disappointed that many foreign students appeared to be swayed by the pro-Nazi arguments espoused there. Popov discovered that the German debaters were all hand-picked party members who chose the subject of each debate beforehand and vigorously rehearsed Nazi talking points. He persuaded Jebsen, then the president of the club, to inform him of the debate topics in advance and passed this information along to the British and American debaters. Popov himself delivered two speeches at the club, arguing in favour of democracy.{{sfn|Miller|2004|pp=16\u201317}} He also wrote several articles for the Belgrade [[daily newspaper|daily]] ''[[Politika]]'', ridiculing the Nazis. \"Du\u0161ko despised Nazism,\" biographer Larry Loftis writes, \"and since he wasn't German, he believed he owed no allegiance to Hitler or the state.\"{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Popov completed his doctoral thesis, and decided to celebrate by embarking on a trip to Paris. Before he could leave, he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]], who accused him of being a [[communism|communist]]. His movements had been tracked by undercover agents beforehand and his acquaintances questioned. Popov was incarcerated at the Freiburg prison without formal proceedings.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|pp=9\u201312}} When Jebsen received news of his friend's arrest, he called Popov's father and informed him of what had occurred. Popov's father contacted Yugoslav [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]], who raised the issue with [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], and after eight days in captivity, Popov was released. He was ordered to leave Germany within 24 hours, and upon collecting his belongings, boarded a train for [[Switzerland]].{{sfn|Miller|2004|pp=17\u201318}} He soon arrived in [[Basel]] and found Jebsen waiting for him on the station platform. Jebsen informed Popov of the role he played in securing his release. Popov expressed gratitude and told Jebsen that if he was ever in need of any assistance he needed only ask.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=19}}\n\n==World War II==\n===Initiation===\n[[File:Dusko-Popov-fp-large.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Popov's passport photo, 1941]]\nUpon his return to Dubrovnik in the fall of 1937, Popov began practicing law.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=12}} In February 1940, he received a message from Jebsen, asking to meet him at the Hotel Serbian King in Belgrade. Popov was shocked to find Jebsen a nervous wreck, chain smoking and drinking exorbitantly. He told Popov that he had joined his family's shipping business after graduating from Freiburg and explained that he needed a Yugoslav shipping license to evade the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval blockade at [[Trieste]]. Popov agreed to help Jebsen, and the latter travelled back to [[Berlin]] to collect the required documentation.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=20}} Two weeks later, Jebsen returned to Belgrade, and informed Popov that he had joined the ''[[Abwehr]]'', German's [[military intelligence]] service, as a ''Forscher'' (researcher). \n\nJebsen's ability to travel across Europe on business trips would remain unimpeded so long as he submitted reports detailing the information he had received from his business contacts. He told Popov he joined the ''Abwehr'' to avoid being conscripted into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=21}} Jebsen said military service was not an option because he suffered from [[varicose veins]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=10}} The news came as a surprise to Popov, as his friend had previously expressed anti-Nazi views.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=21}}\n\nPopov informed Clement Hope, a [[passport control officer]] at the British legation in Yugoslavia. Hope enrolled Popov as a double agent with the codename Scoot (he was later known to his handler as Tricycle), and advised him to cooperate with Jebsen.<ref name=\"ODNBDP\">[[Nigel West]], 'Popov, Dusan (1912\u20131981)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008</ref> Once accepted as a double agent, Popov moved to [[London]]. His international business activities in an import-export business provided cover for visits to [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[Portugal]]; its capital, [[Lisbon]], was linked to the UK by a weekly civilian air service for most of the war. Popov used his cover position to report periodically to his Abwehr handlers in Portugal.

Masterman]]'s book ''[[Double Cross System|The Double Cross System]]''). Of the three typewritten pages of the questionnaire, one entire page was devoted to highly detailed questions about US defences at [[Pearl Harbor]] on the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. He made contact with the [[FBI]] and explained what he had been asked to do. \n\nDuring a televised interview, Du\u0161ko Popov related having informed the FBI on 12 August, 1941 of the impending [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Either the FBI chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] did not report this fact to his superiors<ref name=\"RJJ\">Jeffreys-Jones, Rhodri (2007).\n[https://archive.org/details/fbihistory00jeff/page/110 <!-- quote=\"Dusan Popov\" pearl harbor. --> FBI: A History''], p.110. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-11914-3}}.</ref> or they, for reasons of their own, took no action. \n\nHoover distrusted Popov because he was a double agent although MI6 had told the FBI in [[New York City]] that he would be arriving. Popov himself said Hoover was quite suspicious and distrustful of him and, according to author William \"Mole\" Wood, when Hoover discovered Popov had brought a woman from [[New York State]] to Florida, threatened to have him arrested under the [[Mann Act]] if he did not leave the US immediately.\n\n===Operation Fortitude===\nIn 1944, Popov became a key part of the deception operation codenamed [[Operation Fortitude|Fortitude]]. When Jebsen was arrested by the Gestapo in Lisbon, the British feared Popov had been compromised and ceased giving him critical information to pass along to the Germans. It was later discovered that the Abwehr still regarded Popov as an asset and he was brought back into use by the British. Jebsen's death at the hands of the Nazis had a profound emotional impact on Popov.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1972, [[John Cecil Masterman]] published ''The Double Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945'', an intimate account of wartime British military deception. Prior to the publication of Masterman's book, Popov had no intention of revealing his wartime activities, believing that the MI6 would not allow it. Masterman's book convinced Popov that it was time to make his exploits public. In 1974, Popov published an autobiography titled ''Spy/Counterspy'', \"a racy account of his adventures that read like a [[James Bond (franchise)|James Bond]] novel.\" Miller describes it as \"fundamentally accurate, if occasionally embellished\".

Popov is considered one of [[Ian Fleming]]'s primary inspirations for the character of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]].\n\nPopov was born into a wealthy family and was a practicing lawyer at the start of the war. He held a great aversion to [[Nazism]], and in 1940, infiltrated the [[Abwehr]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s [[military intelligence]] service, which considered him a valuable asset due to his business connections in France and the United Kingdom. Popov provided the Germans with misleading and inaccurate information for much of the war. \n\nDeceptions in which he participated included [[Operation Fortitude]], which sought to convince German military planners that the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of Europe would take place in [[Calais]], not [[Normandy]], thereby diverting hundreds of thousands of German troops and increasing the likelihood that [[Operation Overlord]] would succeed.\n\nPopov was known for his promiscuous lifestyle and courted women during his missions, including the French actress [[Simone Simon]]. Apart from MI6 and the Abwehr, he also reported to the Yugoslav intelligence service, which assigned him the codename '''Du\u0161ko'''. His German handlers referred to him by the codename '''Ivan'''. He was codenamed '''Tricycle''' by the British MI5 because he was the head of a group of three double agents.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Operation Snow: How a Soviet Mole in FDR's White House Triggered Pearl Harbor|last=Koster|first=John|publisher=Regnery|year=2012|isbn=9781596983298|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1974, he published an autobiography titled ''Spy/Counterspy'', in which he recounted his wartime exploits.

In November 1918, Austria-Hungary disintegrated into a number of smaller states, and its Balkan possessions were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). The newly established, Serb-led state was plagued by political infighting among its various constitutive ethnic groups, particularly Serbs and [[Croats]], but also [[Hungarians]] and ethnic [[Germans]]. The young Popov and his family enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle and were far removed from the political turmoil in the country. They boasted a sizeable collection of [[villa]]s and yachts, and were attended by servants, even on their travels.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=13}} Du\u0161ko and his brothers spent most of their formative years along the [[Adriatic]] coast, and were avid athletes and outdoorsmen.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=3}}\n\nPopov's father indulged his sons, building a spacious villa by the sea for their exclusive use where they could entertain their friends and host expensive parties. He was also insistent that they receive a quality education. Apart from his native Serbian, Popov was fluent in Italian, German and French by his teenage years.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}} Between the ages of 12 and 16, he attended a ''[[Secondary education in France#Lyc\u00e9e|lyc\u00e9e]]'' in [[Paris]]. In 1929, Popov's father enrolled him into [[Ewell Castle School|Ewell Castle]], a prestigious [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[Surrey]]. Popov's stint at the school proved to be short lived. After only four months, he was expelled following an altercation with a teacher.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=4}} He had previously endured a [[caning]] at the teacher's hands after being caught smoking a cigarette. Another caning was adjudicated after Popov missed a [[school detention|detention]], and so as to evade further [[corporal punishment]], Popov grabbed the teacher's cane and snapped it in two before his classmates. Popov's father subsequently enrolled him at ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]]'', a secondary institution in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], which he attended for the following two years.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}}\n\n==Student activism==\nAt the age of 18, Popov enrolled in the [[University of Belgrade]], seeking an [[undergraduate degree]] in law. Over the next four years, he became a familiar face in Belgrade's cafes and nightclubs, and had the reputation of a [[wikt:lady's man|ladies' man]].{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=15}} \"Women&nbsp;... found him irresistible,\" ''[[The Times|Times]]'' columnist Ben Macintyre writes, \"with his easy manner, loose, sensual mouth&nbsp;... and green&nbsp;... bedroom eyes.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=7}} In 1934, Popov enrolled in the [[University of Freiburg]], intent on securing a doctorate in law. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had only recently come under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], but at the time, Popov paid little regard to politics. He had chosen Freiburg because it was relatively close to his native country and he was eager to improve his German-language skills. Germany was already the site of [[Nazi book burnings|mass book burnings]], the first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] had been established and the systematic persecution of [[Jews]] had commenced.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=15}}\n\nPopov began his studies at the University of Freiburg in the autumn of 1935, and in subsequent months, began showing greater interest in politics and voiced his political opinions more vigorously.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=9}} Around the same time, he befriended a fellow student, [[Johann Jebsen|Johnny Jebsen]], the son of a German shipping magnate. The two grew close, largely due to their raucous lifestyle and a shared interest in sports vehicles.{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=7}} In 1936\u201337, Popov began participating in debates at the ''Ausl\u00e4nder Club'', which were held every other Friday evening. He was disappointed that many foreign students appeared to be swayed by the pro-Nazi arguments espoused there. Popov discovered that the German debaters were all hand-picked party members who chose the subject of each debate beforehand and vigorously rehearsed Nazi talking points. He persuaded Jebsen, then the president of the club, to inform him of the debate topics in advance and passed this information along to the British and American debaters. Popov himself delivered two speeches at the club, arguing in favour of democracy.{{sfn|Miller|2004|pp=16\u201317}} He also wrote several articles for the Belgrade [[daily newspaper|daily]] ''[[Politika]]'', ridiculing the Nazis. \"Du\u0161ko despised Nazism,\" biographer Larry Loftis writes, \"and since he wasn't German, he believed he owed no allegiance to Hitler or the state.\"{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Popov completed his doctoral thesis, and decided to celebrate by embarking on a trip to Paris. Before he could leave, he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]], who accused him of being a [[communism|communist]]. His movements had been tracked by undercover agents beforehand and his acquaintances questioned. Popov was incarcerated at the Freiburg prison without formal proceedings.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|pp=9\u201312}} When Jebsen received news of his friend's arrest, he called Popov's father and informed him of what had occurred. Popov's father contacted Yugoslav [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]], who raised the issue with [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], and after eight days in captivity, Popov was released. He was ordered to leave Germany within 24 hours, and upon collecting his belongings, boarded a train for [[Switzerland]].{{sfn|Miller|2004|pp=17\u201318}} He soon arrived in [[Basel]] and found Jebsen waiting for him on the station platform. Jebsen informed Popov of the role he played in securing his release. Popov expressed gratitude and told Jebsen that if he was ever in need of any assistance he needed only ask.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=19}}\n\n==World War II==\n===Initiation===\n[[File:Dusko-Popov-fp-large.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Popov's passport photo, 1941]]\nUpon his return to Dubrovnik in the fall of 1937, Popov began practicing law.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|p=12}} In February 1940, he received a message from Jebsen, asking to meet him at the Hotel Serbian King in Belgrade. Popov was shocked to find Jebsen a nervous wreck, chain smoking and drinking exorbitantly. He told Popov that he had joined his family's shipping business after graduating from Freiburg and explained that he needed a Yugoslav shipping license to evade the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval blockade at [[Trieste]]. Popov agreed to help Jebsen, and the latter travelled back to [[Berlin]] to collect the required documentation.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=20}} Two weeks later, Jebsen returned to Belgrade, and informed Popov that he had joined the ''[[Abwehr]]'', German's [[military intelligence]] service, as a ''Forscher'' (researcher). \n\nJebsen's ability to travel across Europe on business trips would remain unimpeded so long as he submitted reports detailing the information he had received from his business contacts. He told Popov he joined the ''Abwehr'' to avoid being conscripted into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=21}} Jebsen said military service was not an option because he suffered from [[varicose veins]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=10}} The news came as a surprise to Popov, as his friend had previously expressed anti-Nazi views.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=21}}\n\nPopov informed Clement Hope, a [[passport control officer]] at the British legation in Yugoslavia. Hope enrolled Popov as a double agent with the codename Scoot (he was later known to his handler as Tricycle), and advised him to cooperate with Jebsen.<ref name=\"ODNBDP\">[[Nigel West]], 'Popov, Dusan (1912\u20131981)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008</ref> Once accepted as a double agent, Popov moved to [[London]]. His international business activities in an import-export business provided cover for visits to [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[Portugal]]; its capital, [[Lisbon]], was linked to the UK by a weekly civilian air service for most of the war. Popov used his cover position to report periodically to his Abwehr handlers in Portugal.

Masterman]]'s book ''[[Double Cross System|The Double Cross System]]''). Of the three typewritten pages of the questionnaire, one entire page was devoted to highly detailed questions about US defences at [[Pearl Harbor]] on the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. He made contact with the [[FBI]] and explained what he had been asked to do. \n\nDuring a televised interview, Du\u0161ko Popov related having informed the FBI on 12 August, 1941 of the impending [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Either the FBI chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] did not report this fact to his superiors<ref name=\"RJJ\">Jeffreys-Jones, Rhodri (2007).\n[https://archive.org/details/fbihistory00jeff/page/110 <!-- quote=\"Dusan Popov\" pearl harbor. --> FBI: A History''], p.110.

Popov himself said Hoover was quite suspicious and distrustful of him and, according to author William \"Mole\" Wood, when Hoover discovered Popov had brought a woman from [[New York State]] to Florida, threatened to have him arrested under the [[Mann Act]] if he did not leave the US immediately.\n\n===Operation Fortitude===\nIn 1944, Popov became a key part of the deception operation codenamed [[Operation Fortitude|Fortitude]]. When Jebsen was arrested by the Gestapo in Lisbon, the British feared Popov had been compromised and ceased giving him critical information to pass along to the Germans. It was later discovered that the Abwehr still regarded Popov as an asset and he was brought back into use by the British. Jebsen's death at the hands of the Nazis had a profound emotional impact on Popov.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1972, [[John Cecil Masterman]] published ''The Double Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945'', an intimate account of wartime British military deception. Prior to the publication of Masterman's book, Popov had no intention of revealing his wartime activities, believing that the MI6 would not allow it. Masterman's book convinced Popov that it was time to make his exploits public. In 1974, Popov published an autobiography titled ''Spy/Counterspy'', \"a racy account of his adventures that read like a [[James Bond (franchise)|James Bond]] novel.\" Miller describes it as \"fundamentally accurate, if occasionally embellished\". Several of the events described in the book were either entirely fictional, such as a fistfight Popov claimed to have had with a German agent, exaggerated for dramatic effect, or could not be substantiated through subsequently declassified intelligence records.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=252}} Popov's wife and children were apparently unaware of his past until the book's publication.{{sfn|Levine|2011|p=252}}\n\nBy the early 1980s, years of chain smoking and heavy drinking had taken a toll on Popov's health.

Two other documentaries recounting Popov's exploits, ''The Real Life James Bond: Dusko Popov'' and ''Double Agent Dusko Popov: Inspiration for James Bond'', have also been produced.{{sfn|Loftis|2016|pp=283\u2013284}} Popov has also been the subject of several biographies, notably Miller's ''Codename Tricycle'' (2004) and Loftis' ''Into the Lion's Mouth'' (2016).{{sfn|Miller|2004|loc=Front cover}}{{sfn|Loftis|2016|loc=Front cover}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Inspirations for James Bond]]\n* [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate]]\n\n==References==\n;Endnotes\n{{notelist|40em}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Jorgensen\n  | first = Christer \n  | year = 2004\n  | title = Hitler's Espionage Machine\n  | publisher = Globe Pequot\n  | location = Guilford, Connecticut\n  | isbn = 978-1-59228-326-2\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Levine\n  | first = Joshua\n  | year = 2011\n  | title = Operation Fortitude\n  | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield\n  | location = Lanham, Maryland\n  | isbn = 978-0-7627-7735-8\n  | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=cQWiCwAAQBAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }} \n* {{cite book\n  | last = Loftis\n  | first = Larry\n  | year = 2016\n  | title = Into the Lion's Mouth: The True Story of Du\u0161ko Popov\n  | publisher = Penguin\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-425-28181-9\n  | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=M722CgAAQBAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Macintyre\n  | first = Ben\n  | authorlink = Ben Macintyre\n  | year = 2012\n  | title = Double-Cross\n  | publisher = Broadway Books\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-307-88877-8\n  | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=GWr0zTURPXMC\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Miller\n  | first = Russell\n  | authorlink = Russell Miller\n  | year = 2004\n  | title = Codename Tricycle\n  | publisher = Random House\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-1-84413-088-7\n  | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=s2wWwQWSSIEC\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Popov\n  | first = Dusko\n  | year = 1974\n  | title = Spy/Counterspy\n  | publisher = Grosset & Dunlap\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-448-11606-8\n  | ref = harv\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/spycounterspyaut00popo\n  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://duskopopov.com/ Official website ] {{in lang|fr}}\n*[http://www.voa.mod.gov.rs/sr/istorijat/znacajne-licnosti-vos/popov-dusan-tricikl#.VTF9DPApoRM VOA Profile ] {{in lang|sr}}\n*[http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=8204882&CATLN=6&accessmethod=5 The National Archives] \n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Dusko Popov}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Popov, Dusan}}\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:1981 deaths]]\n[[Category:Abwehr]]\n[[Category:British memoirists]]\n[[Category:Double agents]]\n[[Category:Double Cross System]]\n[[Category:Serbian people of World War II]]\n[[Category:Serbian socialites]]\n[[Category:Serbian spies]]\n[[Category:People from Titel]]\n[[Category:People educated at Ewell Castle School]]\n[[Category:University of Freiburg alumni]]\n[[Category:World War II spies for the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:World War II espionage|Spies]]\n[[Category:World War II spies for Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Steel1943", "label": "safe", "comment": "Ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%C5%A1ko_Popov"}
