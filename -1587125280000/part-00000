Standing results in an increased [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic]] pressure in the blood vessels of the lower limbs. The consequent distension of the veins below the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] (venous pooling) causes ~500 ml of blood to be relocated from the chest and upper body. This results in a rapid decrease in central blood volume and a reduction of ventricular [[Preload (cardiology)|preload]] which in turn reduces stroke volume, and mean arterial pressure. Normally this is compensated for by multiple mechanisms, including activation of the [[autonomic nervous system]] which increases [[heart rate]], [[myocardial contractility]] and systemic arterial [[vasoconstriction]] to preserve blood pressure and elicits [[Vein|venous]] vasoconstriction to decrease venous [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]]. Decreased venous compliance also results from  an intrinsic [[Myogenic mechanism|myogenic]] increase in venous [[smooth muscle]] tone in response to the elevated pressure in the veins of the lower body. Other compensatory mechanisms include the veno-arteriolar [[axon reflex]], the '[[Skeletal-muscle pump|skeletal muscle pump]]' and '[[Venous return curve|respiratory pump]]'.

Since sodium is the main ion that determines the amount of fluid in the blood vessels by [[osmosis]], aldosterone will increase fluid retention, and indirectly, arterial pressure.\n* [[Baroreceptor]]s in [[low pressure receptor zones]] (mainly in the [[venae cavae]] and the [[pulmonary veins]], and in the [[atrium (heart)|atria]]) result in feedback by regulating the secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH/Vasopressin), [[renin]] and [[aldosterone]]. The resultant increase in [[blood volume]] results in an increased [[cardiac output]] by the [[Frank\u2013Starling law of the heart]], in turn increasing arterial blood pressure.\n\nThese different mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other, as indicated by the link between the RAS and aldosterone release. When blood pressure falls many physiological cascades commence in order to return the blood pressure to a more appropriate level.\n\n# The blood pressure fall is detected by a decrease in blood flow and thus a decrease in [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR).\n# Decrease in GFR is sensed as a decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> levels by the [[macula densa]].\n# The macula densa causes an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, which causes water to follow in via [[osmosis]] and leads to an ultimate increase in [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume. Further, the macula densa releases adenosine which causes constriction of the afferent arterioles.\n# At the same time,  the [[juxtaglomerular cells]] sense the decrease in blood pressure and release [[renin]].\n# Renin converts [[angiotensinogen]] (inactive form) to [[angiotensin I]] (active form).\n# Angiotensin I flows in the bloodstream until it reaches the capillaries of the lungs where [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE) acts on it to convert it into [[angiotensin II]].\n# Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor that will increase blood flow to the heart and subsequently the preload, ultimately increasing the [[cardiac output]].\n# Angiotensin II also causes an increase in the release of [[aldosterone]] from the [[adrenal gland]]s.\n# Aldosterone further increases the Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption in the [[distal convoluted tubule]] of the [[nephron]].\n\nCurrently, the RAS is targeted pharmacologically by [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The aldosterone system is directly targeted by [[spironolactone]], an [[aldosterone antagonist]]. The fluid retention may be targeted by [[diuretic]]s; the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is due to its effect on blood volume. Generally, the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in [[hypertension]] because if blocked, individuals may suffer from [[orthostatic hypotension]] and [[fainting]].\n\n== Measurement ==\n[[File:Blood Pressure - Take Another Person.png|thumb|Taking blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer]]\n{{Main|Blood pressure measurement}}\nArterial pressure is most commonly measured via a [[sphygmomanometer]], which uses the height of a column of mercury, or an aneroid gauge, to reflect the blood pressure by auscultation.<ref name='Booth1977'>{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth J | title = A short history of blood pressure measurement | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 11 | pages = 793\u20139 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 341169 | pmc = 1543468 | doi = 10.1177/003591577707001112 }}</ref> The most common automated blood pressure measurement technique is based on the [[Blood pressure measurement#Oscillometric|oscillometric]] method.<ref name=For2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Forouzanfar M, Dajani HR, Groza VZ, Bolic M, Rajan S, Batkin I | title = Oscillometric Blood Pressure Estimation: Past, Present, and Future | journal = IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering | volume = 8 | pages = 44\u201363 | date = 2015-01-01 | pmid = 25993705 | doi = 10.1109/RBME.2015.2434215 }}</ref> Fully automated oscillometric measurement has been available since 1981.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US4427013A/en?q=donald&q=nunn&oq=donald+nunn Google patents: Donald Nunn\u2014Apparatus and method for measuring blood pressure]</ref> This principle has recently been used to measure blood pressure with a smartphone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrasekhar A, Kim CS, Naji M, Natarajan K, Hahn JO, Mukkamala R | title = Smartphone-based blood pressure monitoring via the oscillometric finger-pressing method | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 431 | pages = eaap8674 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29515001 | pmc = 6039119 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aap8674 }}</ref> Measuring pressure [[Invasive blood pressure|invasively]], by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement, is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting.\nNovel methods to measure blood pressure without penetrating the arterial wall, and without applying any pressure on patient's body are currently being explored.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Sol\u00e0 | first1=Josep | last2=Delgado-Gonzalo | first2=Ricard |title=The Handbook of Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring |date=2019 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-030-24701-0 |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030247003}}</ref> So-called cuffless measurements, these methods open the door to more comfortable and acceptable blood pressure monitors.

Most of this pressure is due to work done by the heart by pumping blood through the [[circulatory system]]. Used without further specification, \"blood pressure\" usually refers to the pressure in large [[Artery|arteries]] of the [[systemic circulation]].  Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the [[systole|systolic pressure]] (maximum during one heartbeat) over [[diastole|diastolic pressure]] (minimum in between two [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]s) and is measured in millimeters of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] ([[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]]), above the surrounding [[atmospheric pressure]].\n\nBlood pressure is one of the [[vital signs]], along with [[respiratory rate]], [[heart rate]], [[oxygen saturation]], and [[body temperature]].  Normal resting blood pressure,  in an [[adult]] is approximately {{convert|120|mmHg}} systolic, and {{convert|80|mmHg}} diastolic, abbreviated \"120/80&nbsp;mmHg\". Globally, the average blood pressure, age standardized,  has remained about the same since 1975 to the present, at approx. 127/79 mmHg in men and 122/77 mmHg in women, although these average data mask quite large divergent regional trends.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement studies with 19\u00b71 million participants |journal=The Lancet |date= January 2017 |volume=389 |issue=10064 |pages=37\u201355 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31919-5/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31919-5 |pmid=27863813 |pmc=5220163 |author1=NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, blood pressure was measured [[non-invasive]]ly using [[auscultation]] with a [[mercury (element)|mercury-tube]] [[sphygmomanometer]].<ref name=\"Booth1977\"/> Auscultation is still generally considered to be the gold standard of accuracy for non-invasive blood pressure readings in clinic.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grim CE, Grim CM | title = Auscultatory BP: still the gold standard | journal = Journal of the American Society of Hypertension | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 191\u20133 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26839183 | doi = 10.1016/j.jash.2016.01.004 }}</ref> However, semi-automated methods have become common, largely due to concerns about potential mercury toxicity,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien E | title = Blood pressure measurement is changing! | journal = Heart | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 3\u20135 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11119446 | pmc = 1729570 | doi = 10.1136/heart.85.1.3 }}</ref> although cost, ease of use and applicability to [[ambulatory blood pressure]] or home blood pressure measurements have also influenced this trend.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogedegbe G, Pickering T | title = Principles and techniques of blood pressure measurement | journal = Cardiology Clinics | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 571\u201386 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20937442 | pmc = 3639494 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccl.2010.07.006 }}</ref> Early automated alternatives to mercury-tube sphygmomanometers were often seriously inaccurate, but modern devices validated to international standards achieve an average difference between two standardized reading methods of 5&nbsp;mm Hg or less and a standard deviation of less than 8&nbsp;mm Hg.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most of these semi-automated methods measure blood pressure using oscillometry.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alpert BS, Quinn D, Gallick D | title = Oscillometric blood pressure: a review for clinicians | journal = Journal of the American Society of Hypertension | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 930\u20138 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25492837 | doi = 10.1016/j.jash.2014.08.014 }}</ref>\n\nBlood pressure is influenced by [[cardiac output]], [[total peripheral resistance]] and [[arterial stiffness]] and varies depending on situation, emotional state, activity, and relative health/disease states.

Standing results in an increased [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic]] pressure in the blood vessels of the lower limbs. The consequent distension of the veins below the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] (venous pooling) causes ~500 ml of blood to be relocated from the chest and upper body. This results in a rapid decrease in central blood volume and a reduction of ventricular [[Preload (cardiology)|preload]] which in turn reduces stroke volume, and mean arterial pressure. Normally this is compensated for by multiple mechanisms, including activation of the [[autonomic nervous system]] which increases [[heart rate]], [[myocardial contractility]] and systemic arterial [[vasoconstriction]] to preserve blood pressure and elicits [[Vein|venous]] vasoconstriction to decrease venous [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]]. Decreased venous compliance also results from  an intrinsic [[Myogenic mechanism|myogenic]] increase in venous [[smooth muscle]] tone in response to the elevated pressure in the veins of the lower body. Other compensatory mechanisms include the veno-arteriolar [[axon reflex]], the '[[Skeletal-muscle pump|skeletal muscle pump]]' and '[[Venous return curve|respiratory pump]]'.

These baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the [[medulla oblongata|medulla of the brain stem]], specifically to the [[rostral ventrolateral medulla]] (RVLM). The medulla, by way of the [[autonomic nervous system]], adjusts the mean arterial pressure by altering both the force and speed of the heart's contractions, as well as the systemic vascular resistance. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right [[carotid sinus]]es and in the [[aortic arch]].<ref name='KlabundeArtBar2007'>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP012.htm |title=Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts \u2013 Arterial Baroreceptors |accessdate=2008-09-09 |last=Klabunde |first=RE |year=2007 }} [http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP012.htm Archived version 2009-10-03]</ref>\n* [[Renin\u2013angiotensin system]] (RAS): This system is generally known for its long-term adjustment of arterial pressure. This system allows the [[kidney]] to compensate for loss in [[blood volume]] or drops in arterial pressure by activating an endogenous [[vasoconstrictor]] known as [[angiotensin II]].\n* [[Aldosterone]] release: This [[steroid hormone]] is released from the [[adrenal cortex]] in response to angiotensin II or high serum [[potassium]] levels. Aldosterone stimulates [[sodium]] retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys. Since sodium is the main ion that determines the amount of fluid in the blood vessels by [[osmosis]], aldosterone will increase fluid retention, and indirectly, arterial pressure.\n* [[Baroreceptor]]s in [[low pressure receptor zones]] (mainly in the [[venae cavae]] and the [[pulmonary veins]], and in the [[atrium (heart)|atria]]) result in feedback by regulating the secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH/Vasopressin), [[renin]] and [[aldosterone]]. The resultant increase in [[blood volume]] results in an increased [[cardiac output]] by the [[Frank\u2013Starling law of the heart]], in turn increasing arterial blood pressure.\n\nThese different mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other, as indicated by the link between the RAS and aldosterone release. When blood pressure falls many physiological cascades commence in order to return the blood pressure to a more appropriate level.\n\n# The blood pressure fall is detected by a decrease in blood flow and thus a decrease in [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR).\n# Decrease in GFR is sensed as a decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> levels by the [[macula densa]].\n# The macula densa causes an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, which causes water to follow in via [[osmosis]] and leads to an ultimate increase in [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume. Further, the macula densa releases adenosine which causes constriction of the afferent arterioles.\n# At the same time,  the [[juxtaglomerular cells]] sense the decrease in blood pressure and release [[renin]].\n# Renin converts [[angiotensinogen]] (inactive form) to [[angiotensin I]] (active form).\n# Angiotensin I flows in the bloodstream until it reaches the capillaries of the lungs where [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE) acts on it to convert it into [[angiotensin II]].\n# Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor that will increase blood flow to the heart and subsequently the preload, ultimately increasing the [[cardiac output]].\n# Angiotensin II also causes an increase in the release of [[aldosterone]] from the [[adrenal gland]]s.\n# Aldosterone further increases the Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption in the [[distal convoluted tubule]] of the [[nephron]].\n\nCurrently, the RAS is targeted pharmacologically by [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The aldosterone system is directly targeted by [[spironolactone]], an [[aldosterone antagonist]]. The fluid retention may be targeted by [[diuretic]]s; the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is due to its effect on blood volume. Generally, the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in [[hypertension]] because if blocked, individuals may suffer from [[orthostatic hypotension]] and [[fainting]].\n\n== Measurement ==\n[[File:Blood Pressure - Take Another Person.png|thumb|Taking blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer]]\n{{Main|Blood pressure measurement}}\nArterial pressure is most commonly measured via a [[sphygmomanometer]], which uses the height of a column of mercury, or an aneroid gauge, to reflect the blood pressure by auscultation.<ref name='Booth1977'>{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth J | title = A short history of blood pressure measurement | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 11 | pages = 793\u20139 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 341169 | pmc = 1543468 | doi = 10.1177/003591577707001112 }}</ref> The most common automated blood pressure measurement technique is based on the [[Blood pressure measurement#Oscillometric|oscillometric]] method.<ref name=For2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Forouzanfar M, Dajani HR, Groza VZ, Bolic M, Rajan S, Batkin I | title = Oscillometric Blood Pressure Estimation: Past, Present, and Future | journal = IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering | volume = 8 | pages = 44\u201363 | date = 2015-01-01 | pmid = 25993705 | doi = 10.1109/RBME.2015.2434215 }}</ref> Fully automated oscillometric measurement has been available since 1981.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US4427013A/en?q=donald&q=nunn&oq=donald+nunn Google patents: Donald Nunn\u2014Apparatus and method for measuring blood pressure]</ref> This principle has recently been used to measure blood pressure with a smartphone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrasekhar A, Kim CS, Naji M, Natarajan K, Hahn JO, Mukkamala R | title = Smartphone-based blood pressure monitoring via the oscillometric finger-pressing method | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 431 | pages = eaap8674 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29515001 | pmc = 6039119 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aap8674 }}</ref> Measuring pressure [[Invasive blood pressure|invasively]], by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement, is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting.\nNovel methods to measure blood pressure without penetrating the arterial wall, and without applying any pressure on patient's body are currently being explored.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Sol\u00e0 | first1=Josep | last2=Delgado-Gonzalo | first2=Ricard |title=The Handbook of Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring |date=2019 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-030-24701-0 |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030247003}}</ref> So-called cuffless measurements, these methods open the door to more comfortable and acceptable blood pressure monitors.

For years there was debate whether the originally recognized path length of {{convert|219|mi|abbr=on}} over 3.5 hours was from one tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later determined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell thunderstorm, which are known as a [[tornado family]]. The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family.

For years there was debate whether the originally recognized path length of {{convert|219|mi|abbr=on}} over 3.5 hours was from one tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later determined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell thunderstorm, which are known as a [[tornado family]]. The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found that the tornado began {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} to the west and ended {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} farther east than previously known, bringing the total path to {{convert|235|mi|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|174|mi|abbr=on}} segment from central [[Madison County, Missouri]] to [[Pike County, Indiana]] is likely one continuous tornado and the {{convert|151|mi|abbr=on}} segment from central [[Bollinger County, Missouri]] to western Pike County, Indiana is very likely a single continuous tornado. Another [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornado was found about {{convert|65|mi|abbr=on}} east-northeast of the end of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State Tornado Family and is likely another member of the family.
