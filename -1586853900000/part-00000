He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up in open rebellion]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a disconnect between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander&nbsp;II's successor, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory&nbsp;VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as [[Canossa]] to meet with the Pope. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's conflicts with the Popes and with his sons and wife, and his \"Walk to Canossa\" established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, others describing him as an exemplary monarch. \n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as the heads of all Christians and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia. Henry&nbsp;III also outraged the Saxon duke, [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Bernard II]], because he supported the duke's main rival, Archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], to seize Saxon counties.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=41\u201342}} The Salian kings who inherited their [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessors' domains in Saxony visited the province frequently. Their lengthy visits irritated the Saxon aristocrats who were exposed to direct royal control for more time than their peers in other parts of the empire. The Saxons' grievances against the Salian monarchs broke out in a series of revolts during Henry&nbsp;IV's reign.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=94}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on 11 November 1050, Henry was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Henry III, by his second wife, [[Agnes of Poitou]].{{sfn|Hill|2020|p=93}} Henry was most likely born in his father's [[Imperial Palace of Goslar|palace]] at [[Goslar]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} His birth had been long-awaited; Henry III had fathered four daughters, but his subjects were convinced only a male heir could secure the \"peace of kingdom\" (as [[Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne]] called it in a sermon).{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} Henry was first named for his grandfather, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], but Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]], whom Henry&nbsp;III had appointed as his son's [[Godparent|godfather]], convinced the Emperor to give his name to his heir.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} At Christmas 1050 the ailing Henry&nbsp;III designated his infant son as his successor in [[P\u00f6hlde]] (in Saxony).{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}} On this occasion, the Emperor also \"caused many of the princes\"\u2014most probably the Saxon and Thuringian aristocrats\u2014\"to promise an oath of fidelity and submission\" to Henry.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann baptised Henry in [[Cologne]] on Easter day 1051.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} In November, the Emperor held an assembly at [[Tribur]] to secure his son's succession.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} The German princes who attended the meeting elected the one-year-old king. They stipulated they would acknowledge him as his father's successor only if he acted as a \"just ruler\" during his father's lifetime.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} Historian Ian S. Robinson supposes the princes actually wanted to persuade Henry&nbsp;III to change his methods of government since the child king had no role in state administration.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} At Christmas 1052, the Emperor made Henry the duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann crowned Henry king in [[Aachen]] on 17&nbsp;July 1054.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} On this occasion, Henry's two-year-old younger brother, [[Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria|Conrad]], most likely received Bavaria from their father.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} When Conrad died in 1055, the Emperor gave Bavaria to Empress Agnes.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=28, 98}} The Emperor betrothed Henry to [[Bertha of Savoy]] in late 1055.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Her parents, [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide, Margravine of Turin]], and [[Otto, Count of Savoy]], controlled north-western Italy. The Emperor wanted to secure their alliance against the rebellious Godfrey the Bearded.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III fell seriously ill after eating a stag's liver in late September 1056.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Historian Herbert Schutz attributes his sudden illness to his exhaustion.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=138}} Already dying, the Emperor commanded his son to the protection of [[Pope Victor II]] who had come from Italy to Germany.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}} Henry&nbsp;III died on 5&nbsp;October 1056.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}}\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Under guardianship===\n\n[[File:Aachener Dom BW 2016-07-09 13-49-15.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A marble throne|[[Throne of Charlemagne]] in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] in Aachen.]]\n\nAt the age of six, Henry succeeded his father unopposed.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}} Pope Victor&nbsp;II convinced the German aristocrats to swear fealty to their young king and enthroned him in Aachen.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}} He reminded them of their promise to consult Empress Agnes in case her son predeceased her and a successor had to be named.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=141}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=28}} Although she had been planning to enter a [[nunnery]], Agnes was appointed her son's [[Legal guardian|guardian]].{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}} She was responsible for her son's education along with a royal ''[[ministerialis]]'' (or unfree servant), Cuno.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=48}} She secured the most powerful aristocrats' support through lavish grants.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}} Agnes was reconciled with Godfrey the Bearded and made her late husband's other opponent, [[Conrad III, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of the Ezzonen family]], [[duke of Carinthia]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=31}}\n\nAgnes took full control of state administration as [[regent]] after Pope Victor&nbsp;II left Germany early in 1057.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=27}} She paid little attention to Burgundy and Italy,{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=143}} but he insisted on her royal prerogative to appoint bishops and abbots to the vacant German sees and monasteries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} Henry had inherited his father's Roman title of patrician, but the reformist concept of \"liberty of the church\" became dominant in Rome during his minority and his mother could not control papal elections.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Pope Victor's successor, [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen&nbsp;IX]]\u2014Godfrey the Bearded's brother\u2014was elected without royal intervention early in August 1057, because the reformist clerics wanted to prevent their opponents from installing their own candidate as pope.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=37}}\n\nA group of Saxon aristocrats plotted against Henry, fearing he would continue his father's oppressive policies after reaching the age of majority. They convinced [[Otto, Margrave of the Nordmark|Otto of Nordmark]], who had recently returned from exile, to mount a coup. Henry's two relatives, [[Bruno II]] and [[Egbert I, Margrave of Meissen|Egbert&nbsp;I of Brunswick]], attacked the conspirators. Bruno killed Otto but was mortally wounded in the skirmish.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=63}}\n\nAgnes appointed a wealthy aristocrat, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, to be [[duke of Swabia]] in 1057.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}}{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|p=52}} She also charged him with the administration of Burgundy, likely because his extensive Burgundian domains enabled him to pacify the local nobles.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=33\u201334}} Godfrey the Bearded took possession of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[March of Fermo|Fermo]] in the [[Papal States]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=33}} Rumours of Godfrey's determination to seize the imperial crown with Pope Stephen's help spread in Italy, but the Pope died unexpectedly on 29&nbsp;March 1058.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=33}} The Roman aristocrats placed one of their number, [[Antipope Benedict X|Giovanni, Cardinal Bishop of Velletri]], on the papal throne, however, the reformist clerics decided to elect [[Pope Nicholas II|Bishop Gerard of Florence]] pope.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001||pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=33}} They sent an envoy to Germany.

In early February 1106, he fled to Cologne where he was received by the townspeople with great respect. He declined all ceremonies, demonstrating that he was doing penance for his sins. His loyal supporter, [[Othbert, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]], made peace with Henry of Limburg to secure the Duke's support. Henry joined them at Li\u00e8ge and mediated a reconciliation between Henry of Limburg and [[Albert III, Count of Namur]]. Robert&nbsp;II of Flanders also promised him assistance.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=338}} Henry addressed a letter to Hugh of Cluny, offering to accept all his terms in return for an absolution.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=339}} He also wrote letters to his son, the German princes and King [[Philip I of France]].

The sarcophagus was placed in an unconsecrated chapel of the Speyer Cathedral on 3&nbsp;September. Five years later, Pope Paschal&nbsp;II granted permission to the younger Henry to bury his father. Henry was buried next to his father in the cathedral on 7&nbsp;August 1111.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=344}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nHenry's conflicts with his subjects, both sons,{{sfn|McLaughlin|2010|p=176}} his wives and with the popes gave rise to a rich polemical literature during his lifetime. Both his supporters and his opponents based their portraits of Henry on two early medieval works: ''[[De duodecim abusivis saeculi|The Twelve Abuses]]'' contained a discussion about legitimate kingship, while [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'' contrasted kingship with tyranny. Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]]. In contrast [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] stated Henry had inherited a peaceful realm, but he \"rendered it filthy, despicable, bloodstrained, a prey to internal conflicts\". Lambert also emphasised that Henry destroyed and robbed churches and put freemen into servitude.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=345\u2013348}}\n\nRumours of Henry's immorality established his bad reputation for centuries.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} The Saxons were the first to accuse him of debauchery and demanded he dismiss the \"swarm of concubines with whom he slept\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=89, 113}} Polemical writings spreading in Germany after 1085 accused Henry of [[incest]] and [[pederasty]], also claiming that he had fathered illegitimate children.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}} Isidore of Seville listed immoral sexual practices among the tyrants' characteristics.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} Consequently, as Robinson emphasises, allegations of Henry's alleged sexual misconduct \"provided his opponents with a useful polemical weapon\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}}\n\nHenry was not a successful military commander, primarily because he did not avoid pitched battles in contrast with most 11th-century military leaders. He could likely adopt this high-risk strategy because he often mustered his troops from among merchants and peasants who were regarded as expendable. He lost most of his major battles; his sole victory at Homburg was primarily attributed to Rudolf of Rheinfelden by their contemporaries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=349\u2013350}} On the other hand, Henry's adaptability and openness to compromise and his preference for dilatory tactics enabled him to survive most critical periods of his reign.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=368}} \n\nHenry's penitential \"Walk to Canossa\" developed into a powerful metaphor. Catholic clerics were the first to adopt it, regarding it as the symbol of the triumph of the Holy See over an immoral monarch. For 19th-century Protestant German nationalists, the ''Gang nach Canossa'' (or \"Road to Canossa\") symbolized the humiliation of Germany by a haughty pope. [[Otto von Bismarck]] proudly declared before the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] that \"Don't worry, we are not going to Canossa, neither physically nor spiritually!\" during [[Kulturkampf|his campaign against political Catholicism]]{{sfn|Pflanze|1990|pp=179, 214}} on 14 May 1872.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=58}}{{sfn|Pavlac|Lott|2019|p=58}} Historians have adopted more sophisticated approaches. They emphasize that penance and reconciliation were integral parts of medieval life, so an annointed king's excommunication was more disturbing for Henry's contemporaries than his act of penance at Canossa.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|p=59}} Henry, as Schutz concludes, \"cleverly maneuvered the pope into a position in which he had to absolve him\", but Gregory&nbsp;VII reduced him \"from Vicar of Christ to being a mere layman\".{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=168}}\n\nHenry's death did not put an end to the Investiture Controversy. A renowned French lawyer, Bishop [[Ivo of Chartres]], and his pupil, [[Hugh of Fleury]], had paved the road to a compromise already in Henry's lifetime. They actually adopted an old view, condemned by reformist clerics, making a distinction between the secular possessions and properties of bishoprics and abbeys (or [[temporalities]]), and the ecclesiastical authority and sacramental powers of the bishops and abbots (or [[spiritualities]]). In 1122, Henry&nbsp;V and [[Pope Calixtus II]] included a similar distinction in their [[Concordat of Worms]], whereby the Emperor renounced the right to instal the prelates in their ecclesiastical offices with ring and staff in return for the right to invest them with their secular possessions using the sceptre.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=93\u201394}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=163\u2013165, 172\u2013173}} The German monarchs' right to acquire a dead prelate's treasury, introduced by Henry, however, remained an important source of wealth, especially during the reigns of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;VI]] in the second half of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=223}}\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy.jpg|thumb|middle|Henry IV and his first wife, Bertha of Savoy (11th-century painting).]]\n\nHenry's first wife, Bertha of Savoy, was a year younger than him.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=266}} Until 5&nbsp;August 1068, Henry regularly mentioned her as \"consort of our kingdom and our marriage-bed\" in his diplomas.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Her disappearance from the diplomas was the sign of a growing disaffection.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} Henry sought a divorce at a general assembly in June 1069 stating their marriage had not been [[Consummation|consummated]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=147}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} The assembled German aristocrats referred his request to a synod, which passed the matter to the Holy See in early October.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Henry's request outraged Pope Alexander II.

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up in open rebellion]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a disconnect between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander&nbsp;II's successor, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory&nbsp;VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as [[Canossa]] to meet with the Pope. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's conflicts with the Popes and with his sons and wife, and his penitentiary \"Walk to Canossa\" established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, others describing him as an exemplary monarch. \n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as the heads of all Christians and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia. Henry&nbsp;III also outraged the Saxon duke, [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Bernard II]], because he supported the duke's main rival, Archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], to seize Saxon counties.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=41\u201342}} The Salian kings who inherited their [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessors' domains in Saxony visited the province frequently. Their lengthy visits irritated the Saxon aristocrats who were exposed to direct royal control for more time than their peers in other parts of the empire. The Saxons' grievances against the Salian monarchs broke out in a series of revolts during Henry&nbsp;IV's reign.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=94}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on 11 November 1050, Henry was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Henry III, by his second wife, [[Agnes of Poitou]].{{sfn|Hill|2020|p=93}} Henry was most likely born in his father's [[Imperial Palace of Goslar|palace]] at [[Goslar]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} His birth had been long-awaited; Henry III had fathered four daughters, but his subjects were convinced only a male heir could secure the \"peace of kingdom\" (as [[Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne]] called it in a sermon).{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} Henry was first named for his grandfather, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], but Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]], whom Henry&nbsp;III had appointed as his son's [[Godparent|godfather]], convinced the Emperor to give his name to his heir.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} At Christmas 1050 the ailing Henry&nbsp;III designated his infant son as his successor in [[P\u00f6hlde]] (in Saxony).{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}} On this occasion, the Emperor also \"caused many of the princes\"\u2014most probably the Saxon and Thuringian aristocrats\u2014\"to promise an oath of fidelity and submission\" to Henry.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann baptised Henry in [[Cologne]] on Easter day 1051.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} In November, the Emperor held an assembly at [[Tribur]] to secure his son's succession.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} The German princes who attended the meeting elected the one-year-old king. They stipulated they would acknowledge him as his father's successor only if he acted as a \"just ruler\" during his father's lifetime.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} Historian Ian S. Robinson supposes the princes actually wanted to persuade Henry&nbsp;III to change his methods of government since the child king had no role in state administration.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} At Christmas 1052, the Emperor made Henry the duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann crowned Henry king in [[Aachen]] on 17&nbsp;July 1054.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} On this occasion, Henry's two-year-old younger brother, [[Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria|Conrad]], most likely received Bavaria from their father.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} When Conrad died in 1055, the Emperor gave Bavaria to Empress Agnes.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=28, 98}} The Emperor betrothed Henry to [[Bertha of Savoy]] in late 1055.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Her parents, [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide, Margravine of Turin]], and [[Otto, Count of Savoy]], controlled north-western Italy.

In early February 1106, he fled to Cologne where he was received by the townspeople with great respect. He declined all ceremonies, demonstrating that he was doing penance for his sins. His loyal supporter, [[Othbert, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]], made peace with Henry of Limburg to secure the Duke's support. Henry joined them at Li\u00e8ge and mediated a reconciliation between Henry of Limburg and [[Albert III, Count of Namur]].

Henry was buried next to his father in the cathedral on 7&nbsp;August 1111.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=344}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nHenry's conflicts with his subjects, both sons,{{sfn|McLaughlin|2010|p=176}} his wives and with the popes gave rise to a rich polemical literature during his lifetime. Both his supporters and his opponents based their portraits of Henry on two early medieval works: ''[[De duodecim abusivis saeculi|The Twelve Abuses]]'' contained a discussion about legitimate kingship, while [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'' contrasted kingship with tyranny. Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]]. In contrast [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] stated Henry had inherited a peaceful realm, but he \"rendered it filthy, despicable, bloodstrained, a prey to internal conflicts\". Lambert also emphasised that Henry destroyed and robbed churches and put freemen into servitude.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=345\u2013348}}\n\nRumours of Henry's immorality established his bad reputation for centuries.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} The Saxons were the first to accuse him of debauchery and demanded he dismiss the \"swarm of concubines with whom he slept\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=89, 113}} Polemical writings spreading in Germany after 1085 accused Henry of [[incest]] and [[pederasty]], also claiming that he had fathered illegitimate children.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}} Isidore of Seville listed immoral sexual practices among the tyrants' characteristics.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} Consequently, as Robinson emphasises, allegations of Henry's alleged sexual misconduct \"provided his opponents with a useful polemical weapon\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}}\n\nHenry was not a successful military commander, primarily because he did not avoid pitched battles in contrast with most 11th-century military leaders. He could likely adopt this high-risk strategy because he often mustered his troops from among merchants and peasants who were regarded as expendable. He lost most of his major battles; his sole victory at Homburg was primarily attributed to Rudolf of Rheinfelden by their contemporaries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=349\u2013350}} On the other hand, Henry's adaptability and openness to compromise and his preference for dilatory tactics enabled him to survive most critical periods of his reign.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=368}} \n\nHenry's penitential \"Walk to Canossa\" developed into a powerful metaphor. Catholic clerics were the first to adopt it, regarding it as the symbol of the triumph of the Holy See over an immoral monarch. For 19th-century Protestant German nationalists, the ''Gang nach Canossa'' (or \"Road to Canossa\") symbolized the humiliation of Germany by a haughty pope. [[Otto von Bismarck]] proudly declared before the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] that \"Don't worry, we are not going to Canossa, neither physically nor spiritually!\" during [[Kulturkampf|his campaign against political Catholicism]]{{sfn|Pflanze|1990|pp=179, 214}} on 14 May 1872.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=58}}{{sfn|Pavlac|Lott|2019|p=58}} Historians have adopted more sophisticated approaches. They emphasize that penance and reconciliation were integral parts of medieval life, so an annointed king's excommunication was more disturbing for Henry's contemporaries than his act of penance at Canossa.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|p=59}} Henry, as Schutz concludes, \"cleverly maneuvered the pope into a position in which he had to absolve him\", but Gregory&nbsp;VII reduced him \"from Vicar of Christ to being a mere layman\".{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=168}}\n\nHenry's death did not put an end to the Investiture Controversy. A renowned French lawyer, Bishop [[Ivo of Chartres]], and his pupil, [[Hugh of Fleury]], had paved the road to a compromise already in Henry's lifetime. They actually adopted an old view, condemned by reformist clerics, making a distinction between the secular possessions and properties of bishoprics and abbeys (or [[temporalities]]), and the ecclesiastical authority and sacramental powers of the bishops and abbots (or [[spiritualities]]). In 1122, Henry&nbsp;V and [[Pope Calixtus II]] included a similar distinction in their [[Concordat of Worms]], whereby the Emperor renounced the right to instal the prelates in their ecclesiastical offices with ring and staff in return for the right to invest them with their secular possessions using the sceptre.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=93\u201394}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=163\u2013165, 172\u2013173}} The German monarchs' right to acquire a dead prelate's treasury, introduced by Henry, however, remained an important source of wealth, especially during the reigns of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;VI]] in the second half of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=223}}\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy.jpg|thumb|middle|Henry IV and his first wife, Bertha of Savoy (11th-century painting).]]\n\nHenry's first wife, Bertha of Savoy, was a year younger than him.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=266}} Until 5&nbsp;August 1068, Henry regularly mentioned her as \"consort of our kingdom and our marriage-bed\" in his diplomas.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Her disappearance from the diplomas was the sign of a growing disaffection.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} Henry sought a divorce at a general assembly in June 1069 stating their marriage had not been [[Consummation|consummated]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=147}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} The assembled German aristocrats referred his request to a synod, which passed the matter to the Holy See in early October.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Henry's request outraged Pope Alexander II.

Despite the pre-season odds, AEK underachieved during the first half of the season and lost the title race too early, making Basinas favourable towards a new move during the winter transfer period.\n\n===Portsmouth===\nOn 2 February 2009, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] confirmed the signing of Basinas on an eighteen-month contract.<ref>[http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/index.php?cms_ref=news&qs_article_id=2129 Basinas joins Blues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206044940/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/index.php?cms_ref=news&qs_article_id=2129 |date=6 February 2009 }}</ref> He made his debut for Portsmouth on 7 February 2009 against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Just a few hours after his debut, manager [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]], who brought Basinas in, was sacked by the club and replaced by [[Paul Hart]]. Under the new manager, Basinas hardly played and was benched for the rest of the season after only making 3 appearances for Portsmouth. Despite little playing time in his first season at Portsmouth, Basinas stated that he wanted to stay at the club.<ref>[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/frattonlatest/Basinas-I39ll-show-you-I39m.5458562.jp Basinas staying at Portsmouth]</ref> When [[Avram Grant]] became the manager of the club, Basinas had continued to impress for Portsmouth when called upon and a poll among Portsmouth fans on 23 January 2010, showed that he's appreciated by the fans. 77% of fans believe that \"Basinas has the creative touch and must play\", while only 2% believed he should leave the club.<ref>[http://www.portsmouth.vitalfootball.co.uk/sitepage.asp?a=185578 \"NO Basinas in Pompey's FA Cup plans?\" Vitalfootball.co.uk] 23 January 2010.

He made his debut on 21 August 2010 in a 1\u20132 away defeat against [[Toulouse F.C.|Toulouse]]. Basinas made a total of five appearances in League 1 and [[Coupe de France|French Cup]]. The contract was broken two months later.\n\n==International career==\nBasinas won his first cap in a 3\u20131 win over El Salvador on 18 August 1999 and scored his first goal in just his second match, also against El Salvador just two days later. He has remained a part of the national team setup since his debut and has been a regular since [[Otto Rehhagel]] took over in 2001.\n\nHe was a key player in Greece's upset [[UEFA Euro 2004|European Championship]] victory, scoring a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in his country's 2\u20131 upset win over host team [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the tournament's opening game. Basinas was a vital player in the hard working midfield of the Greek team throughout the tournament. In the final, [[Charisteas]] scored the winning goal for Greece against Portugal off a corner kick by Basinas, which saw Greece win the trophy.\n\nAfter [[Theodoros Zagorakis]] retired, Basinas was selected to take the captain's arm band. Basinas earned his 100th cap for Greece 1 April 2009 in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup 2010 qualifier]] against [[Israel national football team|Israel]].

To avoid a battle, the local people proposed a fight to the death between two [[water buffalo]] (''kabau'') to settle the dispute. The prince agreed and produced the largest, meanest, most aggressive buffalo. The villagers on other hand produced a hungry baby calf with its small horns ground to be as sharp as knives. Seeing the adult buffalo across the field, the calf ran forward, hoping for milk. The big buffalo saw no threat in the baby buffalo and paid no attention to it, looking around for a worthy opponent. But when the baby thrust his head under the big bull's belly, looking for an udder, the sharpened horns punctured and killed the bull giving the villagers their victory (''manang'', hence ''manang kabau'': \"victors of the buffalo\" which eventually became ''Minangkabau''). The legend however has its rebuttals as the word 'minang' refers to the consumption of [[areca nut]] (''pinang''), yet there hasn't been any popular explanation on the word 'minang' that relates the aforementioned action to the word for \"water buffalo\".\n\nThe first mention of the name Minangkabau as '''Minanga Tamwan''', is in the late 7th century [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]], describing [[Sri Jayanasa of Srivijaya|Sri Jayanasa]] sacred journey from Minanga Tamwan accompanied with 20.000 soldiers heading to Matajap and conquering several areas in the southern of Sumatra.<ref>R.

Until the 20th century the majority of the Sumatran population lived in the highlands. The highlands are well suited for human habitation, with plentiful fresh water, fertile soil, a cool climate, and valuable commodities. It is probable that [[paddy field|wet rice cultivation]] evolved in the [[Minangkabau Highlands]] long before it appeared in other parts of Sumatra, and predates significant foreign contact.<ref name=\"Miksic2004\">{{cite journal| title=From megaliths to tombstones: the transition from pre-history to early Islamic period in highland West Sumatra.| year=2004| journal=Indonesia and the Malay World| volume=32| issue=93| last=Miksic| first=John| doi=10.1080/1363981042000320134| pages=191\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n[[Adityawarman]], a follower of [[Tantric Buddhism]] with ties to the [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]] kingdoms of Java, is believed to have founded a kingdom in the Minangkabau highlands at [[Pagaruyung]] and ruled between 1347 and 1375.<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coed\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George Coed\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

The first contact between the Minangkabau and western nations occurred with the 1529 voyage of [[Jean Parmentier (explorer)|Jean Parmentier]] to Sumatra. The [[Dutch East India Company]] first acquired gold at [[Pariaman]] in 1651, but later moved south to [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] to avoid interference from the Acehnese occupiers. In 1663 the Dutch agreed to protect and liberate local villages from the Acehnese in return for a trading monopoly, and as a result setup trading posts at [[Painan]] and [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]]. Until early in the 19th century the Dutch remained content with their coastal trade of gold and produce, and made no attempt to visit the Minangkabau highlands. As a result of conflict in Europe, the British occupied Padang from 1781 to 1784 during the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], and again from 1795 to 1819 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nLate in the 18th century the gold supply which provided the economic base for Minangkabau royalty began to be exhausted. Around the same time other parts of the Minangkabau economy had a period of unparalleled expansion as new opportunities for the export of agricultural commodities arose, particularly with coffee which was in very high demand. A civil war started in 1803 with the ''Padri'' fundamentalist Islamic group in conflict with the traditional syncretic groups, elite families and Pagaruyung royals. As a result of a treaty with a number of penghulu and representatives of the Minangkabau royal family, Dutch forces made their first attack on a Padri village in April 1821.<ref name=\"Dobbin1977\">{{cite journal| title=Economic change in Minangkabau as a factor in the rise of the Padri movement, 1784\u20131830| last=Dobbin| first=Christine| year=1977| journal=Indonesia| volume=23| issue=1| pages=1\u201338|doi=10.2307/3350883| jstor=3350883| publisher=Indonesia, Vol. 23| hdl=1813/53633}}</ref> The first phase of the war ended in 1825 when the Dutch signed an agreement with the Padri leader [[Tuanku Imam Bonjol]] to halt hostilities, allowing them to redeploy their forces to fight the [[Java War]]. When fighting resumed in 1832, the reinforced Dutch troops were able to more effectively attack the Padri. The main centre of resistance was captured in 1837, Tuanku Imam Bonjol was captured and exiled soon after, and by the end of the next year the war was effectively over.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Adathoofden van de Minangkabau met gevolg TMnr 10026889.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau chiefs, picture taken between 1910 and 1930.]]\nWith the Minangkabau territories now under the control of the Dutch, transportation systems were improved and economic exploitation was intensified. New forms of education were introduced, allowing some Minangkabau to take advantage of a modern education system. The 20th century marked a rise and cultural and political nationalism, culminating in the demand for Indonesian independence. Later rebellions against the Dutch occupation occurred such as the [[1908 Anti-Tax Rebellion]] and the [[1927 Communist uprising]]. During World War II the Minangkabau territories were occupied by the Japanese, and when the Japanese surrendered in August 1945 Indonesia proclaimed independence. The Dutch attempts to regain control of the area were ultimately unsuccessful and in 1949 the Minangkabau territories became part of Indonesia as the province of Central Sumatra.\n\nIn February 1958, dissatisfaction with the centralist and communist-leaning policies of the [[Sukarno]] administration triggered a revolt which was centred in the Minangkabau region of Sumatra, with rebels proclaiming the [[Pemerintah Revolusioner Republik Indonesia|Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]] (PRRI) in [[Bukittinggi]]. The Indonesian military invaded West Sumatra in April 1958 and had recaptured major towns within the next month. A period of guerrilla warfare ensued, but most rebels had surrendered by August 1961. In the years following, West Sumatra was like an occupied territory with Javanese officials occupying most senior civilian, military and police positions.<ref>Kahin (1999), pages&nbsp;165\u2013229</ref> The policies of centralisation continued under the [[Suharto]] regime. The national government legislated to apply the Javanese ''desa'' village system throughout Indonesia, and in 1983 the traditional Minangkabau ''[[nagari (settlement)|nagari]]'' village units were split into smaller ''jorong'' units, thereby destroying the traditional village social and cultural institutions.<ref>Kahin (1999), pages&nbsp;257\u2013261</ref> In the years following the downfall of the Suharto regime decentralisation policies were implemented, giving more autonomy to provinces, thereby allowing West Sumatra to reinstitute the ''nagari'' system.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,101393,00.html |title=Success Story |accessdate=8 October 2007 |last=Tedjasukmana |first=Jason |publisher=Time Inc. | date=12 March 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Pariangan.jpg|thumb|right|The village of Pariangan, located on the slopes of [[Mount Marapi]], is in folklore said to be the first Minangkabau village.]]\nThe traditional [[historiography]] or ''tambo'' of the Minangkabau tells of the development of the Minangkabau World (''alam Minangkabau'') and its ''adat''. These stories are derived from an oral history which was transmitted between generations before the Minangkabau had a written language. The first Minangkabau are said to have arrived by ship and landed on [[Mount Marapi]] when it was no bigger than the size of an egg, which protruded from a surrounding body of water.

The ''darek'' is composed of three ''luhak'' \u2013 [[Tanah Datar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]] and [[Limapuluh Koto]]. The ''tambo'' claims the ship was sailed by a descendant of [[Alexander the Great]] (''Iskandar Zulkarnain'').<ref name=\"Summerfield1999Tambo\">Summerfield (1999), pages&nbsp;48\u201349</ref>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Minangkabau huis met rijstschuren TMnr 60004090.jpg|thumb|Minangkabau house and rice barns.]]\nA division in Minangkabau ''adat'' into two systems is said to be the result of conflict between two half-brothers Datuak Katumangguangan and Datuak Parpatiah nan Sabatang, who were the leaders who formulated the foundations of Minangkabau ''adat''. The former accepted [[Adityawarman]], a prince from Majapahit, as a king while the latter considered him a minister, and a civil war ensued. The Bodi Caniago/[[Adat perpatih]] system formulated by Datuak Parpatiah nan Sabatang is based upon egalitarian principles with all ''panghulu'' (clan chiefs) being equal while the Koto Piliang /Adat Katumangguangan system is more autocratic with there being a hierarchy of ''panghulu''. Each village (''nagari'') in the ''darek'' was an autonomous \"republic\", and governed independently of the Minangkabau kings using one of the two ''adat'' systems. After the ''darek'' was settled, new outside settlements were created and ruled using the Koto Piliang system by ''rajo'' who were representatives of the king.<ref name=\"Summerfield1999Tambo\"/>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Traditional minang costumes.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Minangkabau women clad in traditional Minang costumes.]]\nMinangkabau have large corporate descent groups, but they traditionally reckon descent matrilineally.<ref name=cs>Kuipers, Joel C. \"Minangkabau\".

Each Minangkabau neighbourhood has a ''Musalla'', which means \u201ca temporary place of prayer\u201d in Arabic but in Indonesia simply means a mosque. In the neighbourhood ''Musalla'', men and women pray together, although separated into their respective gender-designated sections.

This tradition has created Minang communities in many Indonesian cities and towns, which nevertheless are still tied closely to their homeland; a state in [[Malaysia]] named [[Negeri Sembilan]] especially is heavily influenced by Minang culture because [[Negeri Sembilan]] was originally Minangkabau's colony.<ref>Michael G.

When precisely the religion spread across the island and was adopted by the Minangkabau is unclear, though it probably arrived in West Sumatra around the 16th century. It is ''adat'' that guides matrilineal inheritance, and though it seems that such a tradition might conflict with the precepts of Islam, the Minangnese insist that it does not. To accommodate both, the Minangkabau make a distinction between high and low inheritance. \u201cHigh inheritance\u201d is the property, including the home and land, which passes among women. \u201cLow inheritance\u201d is what a father passes to his children out of his professional earnings. This latter inheritance follows Islamic law, a complex system which dictates, in part, that sons get twice as much as daughters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/indonesias-minangkabau-the-worlds-largest-matrilineal-society|title=Indonesia's Minangkabau: The World's Largest Matrilineal Society|last=Shapiro|first=Danielle|website=Daily Beast}}</ref>\n\n===Ceremonies and festivals===\n[[File:Minangprocession.jpg|thumb|upright|Women carrying platters of food to a ceremony]]\nMinangkabau ceremonies and festivals include:\n* ''Turun mandi'' \u2013 baby blessing ceremony\n* ''Sunat rasul'' \u2013 circumcision ceremony\n* ''Baralek'' \u2013 wedding ceremony\n* ''Batagak pangulu'' \u2013 clan leader inauguration ceremony.

A ''rumah gadang'' serves as a residence, a hall for family meetings, and for ceremonial activities. The ''rumah gadang'' is owned by the women of the family who live there \u2013 ownership is passed from mother to daughter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.sas.upenn.edu/psanday/reports/matriarchy-and-islam-post-911-a-report-from-indonesia/|title=Matriarchy and Islam Post 9/11: A Report from Indonesia {{!}} Peggy Reeves Sanday|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|date=9 Dec 2002|website=Peggy Reeves Sanday - UPenn|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yuG1WLRW?url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~psanday/report_02.html|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n\nThe houses have dramatic curved roof structures with multi-tiered, upswept gables. They are also well distinguished by their rooflines which curve upward from the middle and end in points, in imitation of the upward-curving horns of the water buffalo that supposedly eked the people their name (i.e. \"[[Minangkabau (legend)|victors of the buffalo]]\"). Shuttered windows are built into walls incised with profuse painted floral carvings. The term ''rumah gadang'' usually refers to the larger communal homes, however, smaller single residences share many of its architectural elements.\n\n=== Oral traditions and literature ===\nMinangkabau culture has a long history of oral traditions. One is the ''pidato adat'' (ceremonial orations) which are performed by clan chiefs (''panghulu'') at formal occasions such as weddings, funerals, adoption ceremonies, and ''panghulu'' inaugurations. These ceremonial orations consist of many forms including ''[[pantun]]'', aphorisms (''papatah-patitih''), proverbs (''pameo''), religious advice (''petuah''), parables (''tamsia''), two-line aphorisms (''gurindam''), and similes (''ibarat'').\n\nMinangkabau traditional folktales (''kaba'') consist of narratives that present the social and personal consequences of either ignoring or observing the ethical teachings and the norms embedded in the ''adat''. The storyteller (''tukang kaba'') recites the story in poetic or lyrical prose while accompanying himself on a ''[[Rebab|rabab]]''.\n\nA theme in Minangkabau folktales is the central role mothers and motherhood has in Minangkabau society, with the folktales ''Rancak di Labuah'' and ''[[Malin Kundang]]'' being two examples. ''Rancak di Labuah'' is about a mother who acts as teacher and adviser to her two growing children. Initially her son is vain and headstrong and only after her perseverance does he become a good son who listens to his mother.<ref name=\"Dahsinar1971\">{{cite book |title=Si Malin Kundang |author=Dahsinar |publisher=Balai Pustaka |year=1971}}</ref> ''Malin Kundang'' is about the dangers of treating your mother badly. A sailor from a poor family voyages to seek his fortune, becoming rich and marrying. After refusing to recognise his elderly mother on his return home, being ashamed of his humble origins, he is cursed and dies when a storm ensues and turn him along with his ship to stone. The said stone is in Air Manis beach and is known by locals as ''batu Malin Kundang''.<ref name=\"Dahsinar1971\"/>\n\nOther popular folktales also relate to the important role of the woman in Minangkabau society. In the ''Cindua Mato'' epic the woman is the source of wisdom, while in the ''Sabai nan Aluih'' she is more a doer than a thinker. ''Cindua Mato'' (Staring Eye) is about the traditions of Minangkabau royalty. The story involves a mythical Minangkabau queen, Bundo Kanduang, who embodies the behaviours prescribed by ''adat''. Cindua Mato, a servant of the queen, uses magic to defeat hostile outside forces and save the kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Some Notes on the Kaba Tjindua Mato: An Example of Minangkabau Traditional Literature |last=Abdullah |first=Taufik |journal=Indonesia |volume=9 |issue=Apr |year=1970 |pages=1\u201322 |doi=10.2307/3350620 |jstor=3350620 |publisher=Indonesia, Vol. 9|hdl=1813/53478 }}</ref> ''Sabai nan Aluih'' (The genteel Sabai) is about a girl named Sabai who avenges the murder of her father by a powerful and evil ruler from a neighbouring village.

Even after the penetration of Islam into Minangkabau society in the 16th century, animistic beliefs were not extinguished. In this belief system, people were said to have two souls, a real soul and a soul which can disappear called the ''semangat''. ''Semangat'' represents the vitality of life and it is said to be possessed by all living creatures including animals and plants. An illness may be explained as the capture of the ''semangat'' by an evil spirit, and a shaman (''pawang'') may be consulted to conjure invisible forces and bring comfort to the family.

The Padri were inspired by the [[Wahhabi]] movement in Mecca, and sought to eliminate societal problems such as tobacco and opium smoking, gambling and general anarchy by ensuring the tenets of the Koran were strictly observed. All Minangkabau customs allegedly in conflict with the Koran were abolished. Although the Padri were eventually defeated by the Dutch, during this period the relationship between ''adat'' and religion was reformulated.

To avoid a battle, the local people proposed a fight to the death between two [[water buffalo]] (''kabau'') to settle the dispute. The prince agreed and produced the largest, meanest, most aggressive buffalo. The villagers on other hand produced a hungry baby calf with its small horns ground to be as sharp as knives. Seeing the adult buffalo across the field, the calf ran forward, hoping for milk. The big buffalo saw no threat in the baby buffalo and paid no attention to it, looking around for a worthy opponent. But when the baby thrust his head under the big bull's belly, looking for an udder, the sharpened horns punctured and killed the bull giving the villagers their victory (''manang'', hence ''manang kabau'': \"victors of the buffalo\" which eventually became ''Minangkabau''). The legend however has its rebuttals as the word 'minang' refers to the consumption of [[areca nut]] (''pinang''), yet there hasn't been any popular explanation on the word 'minang' that relates the aforementioned action to the word for \"water buffalo\".\n\nThe first mention of the name Minangkabau as '''Minanga Tamwan''', is in the late 7th century [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]], describing [[Sri Jayanasa of Srivijaya|Sri Jayanasa]] sacred journey from Minanga Tamwan accompanied with 20.000 soldiers heading to Matajap and conquering several areas in the southern of Sumatra.<ref>R.

Until the 20th century the majority of the Sumatran population lived in the highlands. The highlands are well suited for human habitation, with plentiful fresh water, fertile soil, a cool climate, and valuable commodities.

The first contact between the Minangkabau and western nations occurred with the 1529 voyage of [[Jean Parmentier (explorer)|Jean Parmentier]] to Sumatra. The [[Dutch East India Company]] first acquired gold at [[Pariaman]] in 1651, but later moved south to [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] to avoid interference from the Acehnese occupiers. In 1663 the Dutch agreed to protect and liberate local villages from the Acehnese in return for a trading monopoly, and as a result setup trading posts at [[Painan]] and [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]]. Until early in the 19th century the Dutch remained content with their coastal trade of gold and produce, and made no attempt to visit the Minangkabau highlands. As a result of conflict in Europe, the British occupied Padang from 1781 to 1784 during the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], and again from 1795 to 1819 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nLate in the 18th century the gold supply which provided the economic base for Minangkabau royalty began to be exhausted. Around the same time other parts of the Minangkabau economy had a period of unparalleled expansion as new opportunities for the export of agricultural commodities arose, particularly with coffee which was in very high demand. A civil war started in 1803 with the ''Padri'' fundamentalist Islamic group in conflict with the traditional syncretic groups, elite families and Pagaruyung royals. As a result of a treaty with a number of penghulu and representatives of the Minangkabau royal family, Dutch forces made their first attack on a Padri village in April 1821.<ref name=\"Dobbin1977\">{{cite journal| title=Economic change in Minangkabau as a factor in the rise of the Padri movement, 1784\u20131830| last=Dobbin| first=Christine| year=1977| journal=Indonesia| volume=23| issue=1| pages=1\u201338|doi=10.2307/3350883| jstor=3350883| publisher=Indonesia, Vol. 23| hdl=1813/53633}}</ref> The first phase of the war ended in 1825 when the Dutch signed an agreement with the Padri leader [[Tuanku Imam Bonjol]] to halt hostilities, allowing them to redeploy their forces to fight the [[Java War]]. When fighting resumed in 1832, the reinforced Dutch troops were able to more effectively attack the Padri. The main centre of resistance was captured in 1837, Tuanku Imam Bonjol was captured and exiled soon after, and by the end of the next year the war was effectively over.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Adathoofden van de Minangkabau met gevolg TMnr 10026889.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau chiefs, picture taken between 1910 and 1930.]]\nWith the Minangkabau territories now under the control of the Dutch, transportation systems were improved and economic exploitation was intensified. New forms of education were introduced, allowing some Minangkabau to take advantage of a modern education system. The 20th century marked a rise and cultural and political nationalism, culminating in the demand for Indonesian independence. Later rebellions against the Dutch occupation occurred such as the [[1908 Anti-Tax Rebellion]] and the [[1927 Communist uprising]]. During World War II the Minangkabau territories were occupied by the Japanese, and when the Japanese surrendered in August 1945 Indonesia proclaimed independence. The Dutch attempts to regain control of the area were ultimately unsuccessful and in 1949 the Minangkabau territories became part of Indonesia as the province of Central Sumatra.\n\nIn February 1958, dissatisfaction with the centralist and communist-leaning policies of the [[Sukarno]] administration triggered a revolt which was centred in the Minangkabau region of Sumatra, with rebels proclaiming the [[Pemerintah Revolusioner Republik Indonesia|Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]] (PRRI) in [[Bukittinggi]]. The Indonesian military invaded West Sumatra in April 1958 and had recaptured major towns within the next month. A period of guerrilla warfare ensued, but most rebels had surrendered by August 1961.

The first Minangkabau are said to have arrived by ship and landed on [[Mount Marapi]] when it was no bigger than the size of an egg, which protruded from a surrounding body of water. After the waters receded the Minangkabau proliferated and dispersed to the slopes and valleys surrounding the volcano, a region called the ''darek''. The ''darek'' is composed of three ''luhak'' \u2013 [[Tanah Datar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]] and [[Limapuluh Koto]].

The former accepted [[Adityawarman]], a prince from Majapahit, as a king while the latter considered him a minister, and a civil war ensued. The Bodi Caniago/[[Adat perpatih]] system formulated by Datuak Parpatiah nan Sabatang is based upon egalitarian principles with all ''panghulu'' (clan chiefs) being equal while the Koto Piliang /Adat Katumangguangan system is more autocratic with there being a hierarchy of ''panghulu''. Each village (''nagari'') in the ''darek'' was an autonomous \"republic\", and governed independently of the Minangkabau kings using one of the two ''adat'' systems.

A dominant majority of both males and females pray five times a day, fast during the month of Ramadan, and express the desire to make the holy pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]) to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Each Minangkabau neighbourhood has a ''Musalla'', which means \u201ca temporary place of prayer\u201d in Arabic but in Indonesia simply means a mosque. In the neighbourhood ''Musalla'', men and women pray together, although separated into their respective gender-designated sections. A high percentage of women and girls wear the headscarf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/indonesias-minangkabau-culture-promotes-empowered-muslim-women-68077|title=Indonesia's Minangkabau culture promotes empowered Muslim women|last=Bhanbhro|first=Sadiq|website=The Conversation}}</ref>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poserende Minangkabause mannen TMnr 10005045.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau men in traditional Minangkabau clothes.]]\nAs early as the age of 7, boys traditionally leave their homes and live in a ''[[surau]]'' (a prayer house and community centre) to learn religious and cultural ([[adat]]) teachings. At the surau during night time (after the Isyak prayers), these youngsters are taught the traditional Minankabau art of self-defence, which is Silek, or [[Silat]] in Malay.

This tradition has created Minang communities in many Indonesian cities and towns, which nevertheless are still tied closely to their homeland; a state in [[Malaysia]] named [[Negeri Sembilan]] especially is heavily influenced by Minang culture because [[Negeri Sembilan]] was originally Minangkabau's colony.<ref>Michael G.

When precisely the religion spread across the island and was adopted by the Minangkabau is unclear, though it probably arrived in West Sumatra around the 16th century. It is ''adat'' that guides matrilineal inheritance, and though it seems that such a tradition might conflict with the precepts of Islam, the Minangnese insist that it does not. To accommodate both, the Minangkabau make a distinction between high and low inheritance. \u201cHigh inheritance\u201d is the property, including the home and land, which passes among women. \u201cLow inheritance\u201d is what a father passes to his children out of his professional earnings. This latter inheritance follows Islamic law, a complex system which dictates, in part, that sons get twice as much as daughters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/indonesias-minangkabau-the-worlds-largest-matrilineal-society|title=Indonesia's Minangkabau: The World's Largest Matrilineal Society|last=Shapiro|first=Danielle|website=Daily Beast}}</ref>\n\n===Ceremonies and festivals===\n[[File:Minangprocession.jpg|thumb|upright|Women carrying platters of food to a ceremony]]\nMinangkabau ceremonies and festivals include:\n* ''Turun mandi'' \u2013 baby blessing ceremony\n* ''Sunat rasul'' \u2013 circumcision ceremony\n* ''Baralek'' \u2013 wedding ceremony\n* ''Batagak pangulu'' \u2013 clan leader inauguration ceremony.

A ''rumah gadang'' serves as a residence, a hall for family meetings, and for ceremonial activities. The ''rumah gadang'' is owned by the women of the family who live there \u2013 ownership is passed from mother to daughter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.sas.upenn.edu/psanday/reports/matriarchy-and-islam-post-911-a-report-from-indonesia/|title=Matriarchy and Islam Post 9/11: A Report from Indonesia {{!}} Peggy Reeves Sanday|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|date=9 Dec 2002|website=Peggy Reeves Sanday - UPenn|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yuG1WLRW?url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~psanday/report_02.html|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n\nThe houses have dramatic curved roof structures with multi-tiered, upswept gables. They are also well distinguished by their rooflines which curve upward from the middle and end in points, in imitation of the upward-curving horns of the water buffalo that supposedly eked the people their name (i.e. \"[[Minangkabau (legend)|victors of the buffalo]]\"). Shuttered windows are built into walls incised with profuse painted floral carvings. The term ''rumah gadang'' usually refers to the larger communal homes, however, smaller single residences share many of its architectural elements.\n\n=== Oral traditions and literature ===\nMinangkabau culture has a long history of oral traditions. One is the ''pidato adat'' (ceremonial orations) which are performed by clan chiefs (''panghulu'') at formal occasions such as weddings, funerals, adoption ceremonies, and ''panghulu'' inaugurations. These ceremonial orations consist of many forms including ''[[pantun]]'', aphorisms (''papatah-patitih''), proverbs (''pameo''), religious advice (''petuah''), parables (''tamsia''), two-line aphorisms (''gurindam''), and similes (''ibarat'').\n\nMinangkabau traditional folktales (''kaba'') consist of narratives that present the social and personal consequences of either ignoring or observing the ethical teachings and the norms embedded in the ''adat''. The storyteller (''tukang kaba'') recites the story in poetic or lyrical prose while accompanying himself on a ''[[Rebab|rabab]]''.\n\nA theme in Minangkabau folktales is the central role mothers and motherhood has in Minangkabau society, with the folktales ''Rancak di Labuah'' and ''[[Malin Kundang]]'' being two examples. ''Rancak di Labuah'' is about a mother who acts as teacher and adviser to her two growing children. Initially her son is vain and headstrong and only after her perseverance does he become a good son who listens to his mother.<ref name=\"Dahsinar1971\">{{cite book |title=Si Malin Kundang |author=Dahsinar |publisher=Balai Pustaka |year=1971}}</ref> ''Malin Kundang'' is about the dangers of treating your mother badly. A sailor from a poor family voyages to seek his fortune, becoming rich and marrying. After refusing to recognise his elderly mother on his return home, being ashamed of his humble origins, he is cursed and dies when a storm ensues and turn him along with his ship to stone. The said stone is in Air Manis beach and is known by locals as ''batu Malin Kundang''.<ref name=\"Dahsinar1971\"/>\n\nOther popular folktales also relate to the important role of the woman in Minangkabau society. In the ''Cindua Mato'' epic the woman is the source of wisdom, while in the ''Sabai nan Aluih'' she is more a doer than a thinker. ''Cindua Mato'' (Staring Eye) is about the traditions of Minangkabau royalty. The story involves a mythical Minangkabau queen, Bundo Kanduang, who embodies the behaviours prescribed by ''adat''. Cindua Mato, a servant of the queen, uses magic to defeat hostile outside forces and save the kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Some Notes on the Kaba Tjindua Mato: An Example of Minangkabau Traditional Literature |last=Abdullah |first=Taufik |journal=Indonesia |volume=9 |issue=Apr |year=1970 |pages=1\u201322 |doi=10.2307/3350620 |jstor=3350620 |publisher=Indonesia, Vol. 9|hdl=1813/53478 }}</ref> ''Sabai nan Aluih'' (The genteel Sabai) is about a girl named Sabai who avenges the murder of her father by a powerful and evil ruler from a neighbouring village.

The differences between dialects are mainly at the [[phonological]] level, though some [[Lexicon|lexical]] differences also exist.

Even after the penetration of Islam into Minangkabau society in the 16th century, animistic beliefs were not extinguished. In this belief system, people were said to have two souls, a real soul and a soul which can disappear called the ''semangat''. ''Semangat'' represents the vitality of life and it is said to be possessed by all living creatures including animals and plants. An illness may be explained as the capture of the ''semangat'' by an evil spirit, and a shaman (''pawang'') may be consulted to conjure invisible forces and bring comfort to the family.

The Padri were inspired by the [[Wahhabi]] movement in Mecca, and sought to eliminate societal problems such as tobacco and opium smoking, gambling and general anarchy by ensuring the tenets of the Koran were strictly observed. All Minangkabau customs allegedly in conflict with the Koran were abolished. Although the Padri were eventually defeated by the Dutch, during this period the relationship between ''adat'' and religion was reformulated.

[[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolution of 1918\u201319]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union. The country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].\n\nToday, Germany is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] led by a [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|chancellor]]. With 83 million inhabitants of its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], it is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous]] country in Europe after [[Russia]], as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. A [[Developed country|highly developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], it offers [[Social security in Germany|social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care]] system, environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is also a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G7]], the [[G20]], and the [[OECD]].

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Murray]], an African American serving as an assistant librarian of the [[Library of Congress]], read a paper before the Banneker Association of Washington that connected Banneker with L'Enfant's plan for the capital city. The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ... By this act the brain of the Afro-American is indissolubly linked with the Capital and nation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Paper Read Before the Banneker of Association of Washington}} ''In'' {{cite book |title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|last=Allen|first=Will W.|year=1921|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=10344679|lccn=21017456}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first1=Will W.|last1=Allen|first2=Daniel|last2=Murray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C|title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|pages=12\u201315|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005|oclc=808618979|isbn=0933121-48-2|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2017-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215012211/https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1976 (more than 50 years later), Jerome Klinkowitz stated within a book that described the works of Banneker and other early black American writers that Murray's report had initiated a myth about Banneker's career. Klinkowitz noted that Murray had not provided any support for his claim that Banneker had recalled L'Enfant's plan for Washington, D.C.

When describing the ceremonial presentation to [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., of a [[sundial]] memorializing Banneker, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' newspaper reported in that year that a speaker had claimed that:\n\n<blockquote>.... he (Banneker) was appointed by President George Washington to aid Major L'Enfant, famed French architect, to plan the layout of the District of Columbia.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

When describing the ceremonial presentation to [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., of a [[sundial]] memorializing Banneker, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' newspaper reported in that year that a speaker had claimed that:\n\n<blockquote>.... he (Banneker) was appointed by President George Washington to aid Major L'Enfant, famed French architect, to plan the layout of the District of Columbia.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

In 1971 and 1999, Bedini wrote that Banneker had constructed his clock from his recollections of that watch ([https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/42/mode/1up Bedini, 1971, p. 42.] and [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/42/mode/2up Bedini, 1999, pp. 42\u201443.]). Bedini did not identify his source for those statements. In 2008, when again describing Banneker's clock, Bedini more cautiously wrote: \"It is said that it was based on his recollections of the mechanism of a pocket watch.\" ([http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx|date=2016-02-03}}).</ref>\n\nFurther, it is open to question as to whether the clock was actually \"remarkable\". Silvio Bedini reported that at least four clockmakers were working in Annapolis, Maryland, before 1753, when Banneker completed his own clock.<ref name=Annapolis/>\n\nA photograph on the historical marker illustrates a wooden striking clock that Benjamin Cheney constructed around 1760.<ref name=\"Banneker marker3\"/><ref>Note: [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini, 1999] contains on [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/45/mode/1up page 45] a photograph of a striking wooden clock that Benjamin Cheney constructed in Connecticut around 1760 that the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] holds in its collections. The wooden clock shown in the Benjamin Banneker Park historical marker is identical to the one shown in the photograph in Bedini, 1999.</ref> The marker does not indicate that the clock is not Banneker's.<ref name=\"Banneker marker3\"/> A fire on the day of Banneker's funeral reportedly destroyed his own clock.<ref name=Bailey/><ref name=Tyson18/>\n\n===Historical marker in Newseum, Washington, DC===\nIn 2008, when the [[Newseum]] opened to the public on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., visitors looking over the Avenue could read a historical marker that stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nBenjamin Banneker assisted Chief Surveyor Andrew Ellicott in laying out the Avenue based on Pierre L'Enfant's Plan. President George Washington appointed Ellicott and Banneker to survey the boundaries of the new city.<ref>Text of historic marker entitled \"1800\u20131860 \u2013 Benjamin Banneker\" on outdoor overlook of Pennsylvania Avenue on Level 6 of Newseum, 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. Text of marker recorded on 2008-04-11.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLittle or none of this appears to be correct. Banneker had no documented involvement with the laying out of Pennsylvania Avenue or with L'Enfant's Plan.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini, 1971, p. 136\"/><ref name=Arnebeck/> Andrew Ellicott surveyed the boundaries of the federal district (not the \"boundaries of the new city\") at the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson.<ref name=\"Mathews p83\" /> Ellicott (not Washington) appointed Banneker to assist in the boundary survey.<ref name=Bedini22 /><ref name=\"Bedini p113\" />\n\n==List and map of coordinates==\n{{GeoGroup}}\n{{reflist|group=\"a\"|30em}}\n==See also==\n[[List of common misconceptions]]: a list of many common misconceptions, including [[List of common misconceptions#Early modern|some about Benjamin Banneker]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|45em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Bedini|first=Silvio A.|authorlink=Silvio Bedini|url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n7/mode/1up|title=Early American Scientific Instruments and Their Makers|place=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian Institution Museum of History and Technology]]|year=1964|lccn=64062352|oclc=999972|accessdate=2019-01-04|journal=United States National Museum Bulletin|number=231|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Bedini |first=Silvio A. |url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf|format=pdf |title=Benjamin Banneker and the Survey of the District of Columbia, 1791 |journal=Records of the [[Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|Columbia Historical Society]]|volume=69/70|pages=7\u201330|year=1969|jstor=40067703|oclc=3860814 |accessdate=2013-01-13|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |archivedate=2017-10-07}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bedini|first=Silvio|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up|title=The Life of Benjamin Banneker|place=New York|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] (copyright 1972) (republished by [[Rancho Cordova, California]]: Landmark Enterprises (1984))|isbn=0910845204|oclc=593414330|lccn=78162755|accessdate=2019-08-29|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Bedini |first=Silvio A. |jstor=40072968 |title=The Survey of the Federal Territory: Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker |journal=Washington History |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Historical Society of Washington, D.C.]] |volume=3 |date=Spring\u2013Summer 1991 |number=1 |pages=76\u201395}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bedini|first=Silvio A.|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up|year=1999|title=The Life of Benjamin Banneker: The First African-American Man of Science|edition=2nd|location=Baltimore|publisher=Maryland Historical Society|isbn=0-938420-59-3|oclc=894558859|lccn=98022848|accessdate=2019-09-11|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}\n** {{cite web |last=Murdock |first=Gail T.|date=November 11, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews |archivedate=2016-03-10 |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8 |title=Benjamin Banneker \u2013 the man and the myths |work=Customer review of Bedini, Silvio A.

She is the first  woman to hold this post in Poland (with [[Ewa Kopacz]] and [[Beata Szyd\u0142o]] holding the post in the 2010s) and was the 14th woman to be appointed and serve as prime minister in the world.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women of Power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, {{ISBN|978-1-44731-578-0}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSuchocka was born in [[Pleszew]], Poland, in a Catholic family of chemists. Her grandfather was a University teacher and her grandmother Anna became member of the first Polish parliament after independence in 1918, when women got the right to vote. Suchocka went to law school and became a researcher at the University of Poznan but she was fired when she refused to join the Communist party. She was preoccupied by human rights and undertook a PhD in [[Constitutional Law]] in West Germany in 1975.\n\nIn 1969 she joined a small non-Marxist '[[Bloc party (politics)#Poland|satellite party]]', the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), and was a member of parliament the [[Sejm]] of [[People's Republic of Poland]] in 1980-1985. At the same time she was a member and a legal advisor to ''[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]''. She was one of only a few MPs who did not to vote in favour of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in 1981 and the criminalisation of ''Solidarity'' in 1984. The party suspended her (or she resigned), but with the support of ''Solidarity'' she was reelected to parliament in 1989. When Solidarity supporters split up into several political parties, Suchocka joined the centre-liberal [[Democratic Union (Poland)|Democratic Union]] (DU) and was re-elected to parliament in 1991.\n\n==Prime Minister==\nShe became Prime Minister in 1992. Governments at the time were based on various coalitions and changed constantly. Suchocka was chosen to the amazement of many male politicians but she was known for her low profile and willingness to make compromises and promote reconciliation. She could be accepted by people who had antipathy towards more prominent leaders of DU. In addition, as a left-winger, while being opposed to abortion as a Catholic, she could be accepted by both sides of the political spectrum and satisfy the interests of a majority in a parliament consisting of seven parties, including a Christian and a liberal party.<ref>Opfell (1993) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women prime ministers and presidents'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co, {{ISBN|978-0899507903}}, pp. 212-22; Skard, Torild (2014) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women of power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, {{ISBN|978-1-44731-578-0}}, pp. 344-5</ref>\n\nHanna Suchocka declared that her government was for social reconciliation and would lead the country forward in the transformation from communism to capitalism. She was approved by 233 against 61 votes and 113 abstentions<ref>''Current Biography'' 1994, January, New York, NY: H.W.Wilson, pp 50-3</ref> She quickly formed a cabinet, but it didn't include any other female ministers, although she wanted them. None of the coalition partners were willing to accept another woman and she got two male deputy prime ministers. She stayed longer as prime minister than any of her four predecessors, but she did not stay long. There was a wave of strikes and Suchocka was a warm supporter of market reforms and followed a hard line against the strikers. When she wouldn't give salary increases to teachers and health workers, parliament passed a vote of no-confidence by a majority of one vote. Wa\u0142\u0119sa dissolved parliament and held new elections and Suchocka resigned as soon as the new parliament was in place.<ref>Lewis, Jone Johnson (1992) ''Hanna Suchocka government'', October, www.womenshistory.about.com and ''Who's Who in Poland, Directory of members of parliament, state and local government and the presidential chancellery 1994-1995'', (1994) Warsaw, p.II-497</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n\nIn 1994 Hanna Suchocka was one of the founders of a liberal and social-democratic Liberty Union party, which became the country's third largest political force. From 1997 to 2000 she was the minister of justice in a coalition government.<ref>Siemienska, Renata (2003) \"Women in the Polish Sejm\" in R.E.Matland and K.A.Montgomery (eds) ''Women's access to political power in post-communist Europe'', Oxford/New York, NY: Oxford University Press, pp. 217-44</ref>\n\nShe is also a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].<ref>{{in lang|en}} [http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid] is an independent organization dedicated to strengthening democracy around the world by drawing on the unique experience and resources of its Members \u2013 66 democratic former heads of state and government.</ref>\n\nHanna Suchocka is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.\n\nShe served as Poland's Ambassador to the [[Holy See]] from 2002 to 2013. She was also a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] (appointed by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 19 January 1994).\n[[File:Hanna Suchocka, Prime Minister

She is the first  woman to hold this post in Poland (with [[Ewa Kopacz]] and [[Beata Szyd\u0142o]] holding the post in the 2010s) and was the 14th woman to be appointed and serve as prime minister in the world.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women of Power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, {{ISBN|978-1-44731-578-0}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSuchocka was born in [[Pleszew]], Poland, in a Catholic family of chemists. Her grandfather was a University teacher and her grandmother Anna became member of the first Polish parliament after independence in 1918, when women got the right to vote. Suchocka went to law school and became a researcher at the University of Poznan but she was fired when she refused to join the Communist party. She was preoccupied by human rights and undertook a PhD in [[Constitutional Law]] in West Germany in 1975.\n\nIn 1969 she joined a small non-Marxist '[[Bloc party (politics)#Poland|satellite party]]', the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), and was a member of parliament the [[Sejm]] of [[People's Republic of Poland]] in 1980-1985. At the same time she was a member and a legal advisor to ''[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]''. She was one of only a few MPs who did not to vote in favour of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in 1981 and the criminalisation of ''Solidarity'' in 1984. The party suspended her (or she resigned), but with the support of ''Solidarity'' she was reelected to parliament in 1989. When Solidarity supporters split up into several political parties, Suchocka joined the centre-liberal [[Democratic Union (Poland)|Democratic Union]] (DU) and was re-elected to parliament in 1991.\n\n==Prime Minister==\nShe became Prime Minister in 1992. Governments at the time were based on various coalitions and changed constantly. Suchocka was chosen to the amazement of many male politicians but she was known for her low profile and willingness to make compromises and promote reconciliation. She could be accepted by people who had antipathy towards more prominent leaders of DU. In addition, as a left-winger, while being opposed to abortion as a Catholic, she could be accepted by both sides of the political spectrum and satisfy the interests of a majority in a parliament consisting of seven parties, including a Christian and a liberal party.<ref>Opfell (1993) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women prime ministers and presidents'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co, {{ISBN|978-0899507903}}, pp. 212-22; Skard, Torild (2014) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women of power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, {{ISBN|978-1-44731-578-0}}, pp. 344-5</ref>\n\nHanna Suchocka declared that her government was for social reconciliation and would lead the country forward in the transformation from communism to capitalism. She was approved by 233 against 61 votes and 113 abstentions<ref>''Current Biography'' 1994, January, New York, NY: H.W.Wilson, pp 50-3</ref> She quickly formed a cabinet, but it didn't include any other female ministers, although she wanted them. None of the coalition partners were willing to accept another woman and she got two male deputy prime ministers. She stayed longer as prime minister than any of her four predecessors, but she did not stay long. There was a wave of strikes and Suchocka was a warm supporter of market reforms and followed a hard line against the strikers. When she wouldn't give salary increases to teachers and health workers, parliament passed a vote of no-confidence by a majority of one vote. Wa\u0142\u0119sa dissolved parliament and held new elections and Suchocka resigned as soon as the new parliament was in place.<ref>Lewis, Jone Johnson (1992) ''Hanna Suchocka government'', October, www.womenshistory.about.com and ''Who's Who in Poland, Directory of members of parliament, state and local government and the presidential chancellery 1994-1995'', (1994) Warsaw, p.II-497</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n\nIn 1994 Hanna Suchocka was one of the founders of a liberal and social-democratic Liberty Union party, which became the country's third largest political force. From 1997 to 2000 she was the minister of justice in a coalition government.<ref>Siemienska, Renata (2003) \"Women in the Polish Sejm\" in R.E.Matland and K.A.Montgomery (eds) ''Women's access to political power in post-communist Europe'', Oxford/New York, NY: Oxford University Press, pp. 217-44</ref>\n\nShe is also a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].<ref>{{in lang|en}} [http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid] is an independent organization dedicated to strengthening democracy around the world by drawing on the unique experience and resources of its Members \u2013 66 democratic former heads of state and government.</ref>\n\nHanna Suchocka is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.\n\nShe served as Poland's Ambassador to the [[Holy See]] from 2002 to 2013.
