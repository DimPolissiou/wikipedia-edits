The show was produced by British chef [[Jamie Oliver]] and [[Ryan Seacrest]], following Oliver as he attempted to reform the US school lunch programs, help American society fight obesity and change their eating habits in order to live healthier and longer lives.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show premiered on ABC on March 21, 2010, in the UK on [[Channel 4]] on September 13, 2010, in Greece on [[Fox Life Greece]] in November 2010 and in Italy on Raisat [[Gambero Rosso Channel]] in January 2011. Oliver, a celebrity chef and health campaigner in the United Kingdom, used a grassroots campaign in the [[United States|US]] to curb [[obesity]]. In the first season, his efforts were focused in [[Huntington, West Virginia]], statistically one of the unhealthiest cities in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jamieoliver.com/news/jamie-oliver-kickstarts-a-revolution-in\n | title = Jamie Oliver Kickstarts a Revolution in America | date = 2010-01-13}}</ref> In an early trailer for the show, Oliver challenged a group of first grade schoolchildren to identify fruits and vegetables, and they were unable to do so.<ref>{{cite news  | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/26/jamie-olivers-food-revolu_n_478824.html\n | title = First Graders Can't Identify Fruits, Veggies | date = 2010-02-26 | work = [[Huffington Post]] | first=Gazelle | last=Emami}}</ref>  The show appeared to combine the concepts from at least two of his previous TV series' campaigns in the UK: ''[[Jamie's Ministry of Food]]'' and ''[[Jamie's School Dinners]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://reason.com/archives/2010/03/25/jamie-olivers-ministry-of-food/singlepage | title = Jamie Oliver's Ministry of Food Control | date = 2010-03-25  | work = [[Reason.com]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season, Oliver took his food revolution to [[Los Angeles, California]], home to the 2nd largest public school district in the US. Much of the season revolved around the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] board of education's refusals to allow him to film in schools and his subsequent attempts to circumvent their decisions in creative ways.\n\nIn the episode from April 12, 2011, Oliver decried the use of [[pink slime]] in US ground meat and in US school lunches.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/03/09/148298678/is-it-safe-to-eat-pink-slime | title=Is It Safe To Eat 'Pink Slime'? | publisher=NPR | date=March 9, 2012 | accessdate=July 21, 2012 | author=Barclay, Eliza}}</ref><ref name=\"Oliver\"/> In the episode, Oliver explained what the product is and why he was repelled by it.

The developers of Pacific Mall claimed they were the first mall in North America to use this business model,{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=115}} though Pacific Mall was preceded by the condominium mall Chinatown Centre in [[Chinatown, Toronto#West Chinatown|West Chinatown, Toronto]], which opened in 1989.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=138}}\n\nThe mall's construction was opposed by some long-term residents of Markham,{{sfn|Chan|2013|pp=120}} and was delayed numerous times from 1993 to 1996.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=141}} Concerns were raised by [[Markham City Council]] over the impact the mall would have parking and traffic volume, the style of the building that would replace Cullen Country Barns, and challenges in dealing with multiple owners in a condo-style mall.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=118}} The Council commissioned an independent study on retail condominiums by John Winter and Associates, which concluded that retail condos are a positive means of diversifying developments.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=144}} Pacific Mall's application underwent a nine-month review,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=145}} with a building permit granted in May 1995.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=144}}\n\nHistorian Erica Allen-Kim argues that Pacific Mall was \"a weathervane for Markham's ongoing transformation from a rural township to an [[ethnoburb]].\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=133}} Then-deputy mayor of Markham Carole Bell received criticism for her statement that \"everything's going Chinese\" in response to the proliferation of ethnic malls<ref name=\"GM1\">{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Jan |title=Not made in China |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/not-made-in-china/article746929/ |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=22 October 2019 |date=6 November 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Matt |title=Ethnic Relations I: The Evolution of Steeles and Kennedy |url=http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |website=Green Beam City |accessdate=22 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522023252/http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |archivedate=22 May 2010 |date=5 July 2010}}</ref> and attempted to implement by-laws that would have forbid the rezoning of industrial areas for retail condominiums and made English-language signs mandatory on all structures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=133}} Then-mayor of Markham [[Don Cousens]] formed an advisory council of eleven Markham residents and three members of council to \"address associated multicultural issues affecting planning decisions.\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=144}}\n\n===Opening and continued operation===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Emperor's chair at Heritage Town in Pacific Mall.]]\nSources alternately report Pacific Mall as opening in 1996 and in 1997.<ref name=\"1996 Opening\"/><ref name=\"1997 Opening\"/> Its Cantonese name, \"\u592a\u53e4\u5ee3\u5834\" (Tai Gu Gwong Cheung), is derived from [[Pacific Place (Hong Kong)|Pacific Place]] in [[Hong Kong]].
