Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

{"title_page": "Click consonant", "text_new": "{{Manner of articulation}}\n'''Click consonants''', or clicks, are speech sounds that occur as [[consonants]] in many languages of [[Southern Africa]] and in three languages of [[East Africa]]. Examples familiar to English-speakers are the ''[[Tut-tut]]'' (British spelling) or ''Tsk! Tsk!'' (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the ''[[lateral click|tchick!]]'' used to spur on a horse, and the ''[[alveolar click|clip-clop!]]'' sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.\n\nTechnically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The enclosed pocket of air is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released,<ref group=note>This is the case for all clicks that constitute consonants in words. Paralinguistically, however, there are other methods of making clicks: ''under'' the tongue and by releasing the rear occlusion first. See [[#Places of articulation]].</ref> producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, but in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]].\n\n==Notation and sound description==\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|ejectives=no|implosives=no|audio=yes|class=infobox}}\n{{infobox symbol\n|mark = \u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c2 \u01c3 \u0298\n|name=Click consonants\n|unicode=\n{{unichar|01C0|Latin letter dental click}}<br />\n{{unichar|01C1|Latin letter lateral click}}<br  />\n{{unichar|01C2|Latin letter alveolar click}}<br  />\n{{unichar|01C3|Latin letter retroflex click}}<br  />\n{{unichar|0298|Latin letter bilabial click}}\n|different from=\n{{unichar|007C|Vertical line| nlink=Vertical bar}}<br />\n{{unichar|2016|Double vertical line|nlink=Vertical bar}}\n}}\nClick consonants occur at six principal places of articulation. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] may represent a click by placing the assigned symbol for five of the places of articulation (there is as yet no dedicated symbol for the sixth) adjacent to a symbol for a non-click sound at the rear place of articulation, or the click symbol may be combined with diacritics for voicing, nasalization, etc. The IPA symbols are used in writing most [[Khoisan languages]], but [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] typically use [[Latin script|Latin]] {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|x}} and {{angbr|q}} for dental, lateral and alveolar clicks respectively.\n* The easiest clicks for English speakers are the [[dental click]]s written with a single pipe, {{IPA|\u01c0}}. They are all sharp (high-pitched) squeaky sounds made by sucking on the front teeth. A simple dental click is used in English to express pity or to shame someone, and sometimes to call an animal, and is written ''tut!'' in British English and ''tsk!'' in American English. In Italian this sound means \"no\" used as an answer to a direct question, while it is used to call cats when repeated several times.\n* Next most familiar to English speakers are the [[lateral click]]s written with a double pipe, {{IPA|\u01c1}}. They are also squeaky sounds, though less sharp than {{IPA|\u01c0}}, made by sucking on the molars on either side (or both sides) of the mouth. A simple lateral click is made in English to get a horse moving, and is conventionally written ''tchick!''\n* Then there are the [[labial click]]s, written with a bull's eye, {{IPA|\u0298}}. These are lip-smacking sounds, but without the pursing of the lips found in a kiss.\n\nThe above clicks sound like [[affricate]]s, in that they involve a lot of friction. The other two families are more abrupt sounds that do not have this friction.\n* With the [[alveolar click]]s, written with an exclamation mark, {{IPA|\u01c3}}, the tip of the tongue is pulled down abruptly and forcefully from the roof of the mouth, sometimes using a lot of jaw motion, and making a hollow ''pop!'' like a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. These sounds can be quite loud.\n* Finally, for most languages, the [[palatal click]]s, {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are made with a flat tongue, and are sharper popping sounds than the {{IPA|\u01c3}} clicks, like sharply snapped fingers.\n\n==Languages with clicks==\n\n=== Southern Africa ===\nClicks occur in all three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language families]] of [[southern Africa]], where they may be the most numerous consonants. To a lesser extent they occur in three neighbouring groups of [[Bantu languages]]\u2014which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]], directly or indirectly, from Khoisan. In the southeast, in eastern [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]] and southern [[Mozambique]], they were adopted from a [[Tuu languages|Tuu language]] or languages by the languages of the Nguni cluster (especially [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], but also to a lesser extent [[Swati language|Swazi]] and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), and spread from them in a reduced fashion to the Zulu-based [[pidgin]] [[Fanagalo]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Ronga language|Ronga]], the Mzimba dialect of [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]] and more recently to [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]], where the spread of clicks continues. The second point of transfer was near the [[Caprivi Strip]] and the [[Okavango River]] where, apparently, the [[Yeyi language]] borrowed the clicks from a [[Khoe languages|West Kalahari Khoe language]]; a separate development led to a smaller click inventory in the neighbouring [[Mbukushu language|Mbukushu]], [[Kwangali language|Kwangali]], [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], [[Kuhane language|Kuhane]] and [[Fwe language|Fwe]] languages in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]].<ref>Derek Nurse & G\u00e9rard Philippson (2003) ''The Bantu languages,'' pp 31\u201332</ref> These sounds occur not only in borrowed vocabulary, but have spread to native Bantu words as well, in the case of Nguni at least partially due to a type of word taboo called [[hlonipha]]. Some [[creolised]] varieties of Afrikaans, such as [[Oorlams Creole|Oorlams]], retain clicks in Khoekhoe words.\n\n=== East Africa ===\nThree languages in [[East Africa]] use clicks: [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], and [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]] that has clicks in only a few dozen words. It is thought the latter may remain from an episode of [[language shift]].\n\n=== Damin ===\nThe only non-African language known to have clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a ritual code once used by speakers of [[Lardil language|Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an [[Egressive sound|egressive]] click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) \"spurt\".\n\n===Spread of clicks from loanwords===\nOnce clicks are borrowed into a language as regular speech sounds, they may spread to native words, as has happened due to ''[[hlonipa]]'' word-taboo in the [[Nguni languages]]. In [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], for example, the European loanword ''tomate'' (tomato) appears as ''cum\u00e1te'' with a click ''c'', though it begins with a ''t'' in all neighbouring languages.\n\n=== Marginal usage of clicks ===\nScattered clicks are found in [[ideophone]]s and mimesis in other languages, such as [[Kongo language|Kongo]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3/}}, [[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c0/}} and Hadza {{IPA|/\u1d51\u0298\u02b7/}} (Hadza does not otherwise have labial clicks). Ideophones often use phonemic distinctions not found in normal vocabulary.\n\nEnglish and many other languages may use bare clicks in [[interjection]]s, without the accompaniment of vowels, such as the dental \"tsk-tsk\" sound used to express disapproval, or the lateral ''tchick'' used with horses. In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], occasionally in [[French language|French]], as well as southern Italian languages such as [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], in which a bare dental click accompanied by tipping the head upwards signifies \"no\". [[Libyan Arabic]] apparently has three such sounds.\n\nClicks occasionally turn up elsewhere, as in the special [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] twins sometimes develop with each other. In [[West Africa]], clicks have been reported allophonically, and similarly in French and German, faint clicks have been recorded in rapid speech where consonants such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} overlap between words.<ref name=germ>{{cite conference|first=Sussanne|last=Fuchs|first2=Laura|last2=Koenig|first3=Ralf|last3=Winkler|title=Weak clicks in German|format=pdf|conference=Proceedings of the 16th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences|pages=449\u2013452|year=2007|location=Saarbr\u00fccken|url=http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1678/1678.pdf}}</ref> In [[Rwanda language|Rwanda]], the sequence {{IPA|/m\u014b/}} may be pronounced either with an epenthetic vowel, {{IPA|[m\u1d4a\u014b]}}, or with a light bilabial click, {{IPA|[m\u0298\u0303\u014b]}}\u2014often by the same speaker.\n\nSpeakers of [[Gan Chinese]] from [[Ningdu]] county, as well as speakers of Mandarin from Beijing and [[Jilin]] and presumably people from other parts of the country, produce flapped nasal clicks in nursery rhymes with varying degrees of competence, in the words for 'goose' and 'duck', both of which begin with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in Gan and until recently began with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in Mandarin as well. In Gan, the nursery rhyme is,\n:''t\u02b0ien i ts\u02b0ak \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o'' 'a goose in the sky'\n:''ti ha i ts\u02b0ak \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a'' 'a duck on the ground'\n:''\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o sa\u014b \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o t\u02b0an, \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o p\u02b0au \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o'' 'a goose lays a goose egg, a goose hatches a goose'\n:''\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a sa\u014b \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a t\u02b0an, \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a p\u02b0au \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a'' 'a duck lays a duck egg, a duck hatches a duck'\nwhere the {{IPA|/\u014b/}} onsets are all pronounced {{IPA|[\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1]}}.<ref>Geoffrey Nathan, 'Clicks in a Chinese Nursery Rhyme', JIPA (2001) 31/2.</ref>\n\nOccasionally other languages are claimed to have click sounds in general vocabulary. This is usually a misnomer for [[ejective consonant]]s, which are found across much of the world.\n\n=== Position in word ===\nFor the most part, the Southern African [[Khoisan languages]] only use [[root word|root]]-initial clicks.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions occurs in words borrowed from Bantu languages, which may have click in the middle.</ref> Hadza, Sandawe and several [[Bantu languages]] also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots. In no language does a click close a syllable or end a word, but then the languages that happen to have clicks have mostly CV syllables and allow at most only a limited set of consonants (such as a nasal or a glottal stop) to close a syllable or end a word, most consonants share the distribution of clicks in these languages.\n\n=== Types of clicks used ===\nThe Khoesan families (Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe) all have at least four click types, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}} or variants thereof. A few have five, with bilabial {{IPA|{\u0298}}} or retroflex {{IPA|{\u203c}}}. Hadza and Sandawe have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}. Yeyi is the only Bantu language with four, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}}, while Xhosa and Zulu have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}, and most Bantu languages with clicks have fewer than that.\n\n==Types of clicks==\nLike other consonants, clicks can be described using four parameters: [[place of articulation]], [[manner of articulation]], [[phonation]] (including glottalisation) and [[airstream mechanism]]. As noted above, clicks necessarily involve at least two closures, which in some cases operate partially independently: an anterior articulation traditionally represented by the special click symbol in the IPA\u2014and a posterior articulation traditionally described as oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. The literature also describes a contrast between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] rear articulations for some languages.\n\nHowever, recent work shows that in languages that make this distinction, all clicks have a uvular, or even pharyngeal, rear closure\u2014and the clicks explicitly described as uvular are in fact clusters/contours of a click plus a pulmonic or ejective component, in which the cluster/contour has two release bursts, the forward (click) and then the rearward (uvular) component. \"Velar\" clicks in these languages have only a single release burst, that of the forward click release, and the release of the rear articulation isn't separately audible (Miller 2011).\n\nNonetheless, in most of the literature the stated place of the click is the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx),'' whereas the manner is ascribed to the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux).'' The anterior articulation defines the ''click type'' and is written with the IPA letter for the click (dental {{angbr IPA|\u01c0}}, alveolar {{angbr IPA|\u01c3}}, etc.), whereas the traditional term 'accompaniment' conflates the categories of manner (nasal, affricated), phonation (voiced, aspirated, breathy voiced, glottalised), as well as any change in the airstream with the release of the posterior articulation (pulmonic, ejective), all of which are transcribed with additional letters or diacritics, as in the ''nasal alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u01c3\u014b}} or {{angbr IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}} or\u2014to take an extreme example\u2014the ''voiced (uvular) ejective alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u1da2\u01c3\u0361q\u02bc}}.\n\nThe size of click inventories ranges from as few as three (in [[Sesotho phonology#Consonants|Sesotho]]) or four (in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]]), to dozens in the [[Kx\u02bca languages|Kx\u02bca]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] (Northern and Southern Khoisan) languages. [[Taa language|Taa]], the last vibrant language in the latter family, has 45 to 115 click phonemes, depending on analysis (clusters vs. contours), and over 70% of words in the dictionary of this language begin with a click.<ref>L&M 1996, p 246</ref>\n\nClicks appear more [[stop consonant|stop]]-like (sharp/abrupt) or [[affricate]]-like (noisy) depending on their place of articulation: In southern Africa, clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp, like stops, whereas [[labial consonant|labial]], [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks typically have longer and acoustically noisier click types that are superficially more like affricates. In East Africa, however, the alveolar clicks tend to be [[flap consonant|flapped]], whereas the lateral clicks tend to be more sharp.\n\n==Transcription==\n{{further|click letter}}\nThe five click places of articulation with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[labial click|labial]] {{IPA|\u0298}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|\u01c0}}, [[palatal click|palatal]] (\"palato-alveolar\") {{IPA|\u01c2}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] (\"retroflex\") {{IPA|\u01c3}} and [[lateral click|lateral]] {{IPA|\u01c1}}. In most languages, the alveolar and palatal types are abrupt; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The labial, dental and lateral types, on the other hand, are typically noisy: they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (This applies to the forward articulation; both may also have either an affricate or non-affricate rear articulation as well.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] places, {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}}, are sometimes called \"grave\", because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; whereas the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] places, {{IPA|\u01c0}} and {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are sometimes called \"acute\", because they are dominated by high frequencies. (At least in the [[N\u01c1ng language]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], this is associated with a difference in the placement of the rear articulation: \"grave\" clicks are [[uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas \"acute\" clicks are [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]].) Thus the alveolar click {{IPA|/\u01c3/}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low-pitch pop), at least in Xhosa; whereas the dental click {{IPA|/\u01c0/}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!,'' a high-pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The labial click {{IPA|/\u0298/}} is different from what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a {{IPA|[p]}} or an {{IPA|[m]}}, not rounded as they are for a {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nThe most populous languages with clicks, Zulu and Xhosa, use the letters ''c, q, x,'' by themselves and in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], to write click consonants. Most Khoisan languages, on the other hand (with the notable exceptions of [[Naro language|Naro]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]), use a more iconic system based on the [[Vertical bar|pipe]] {{angbr|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}}. (The exclamation point for the \"retroflex\" click was originally a pipe with a subscript dot, along the lines of ''\u1e6d, \u1e0d, \u1e47'' used to transcribe the retroflex consonants of India.) There are also two main conventions for the second letter of the digraph as well: voicing may be written with ''g'' and uvular affrication with ''x'', or voicing with ''d'' and affrication with ''g'' (a convention of Afrikaans). In two orthographies of Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, for example, voiced {{IPA|/\u1da2\u01c3/}} is written ''g!'' or ''dq'', and {{IPA|/\u1d4f\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}} ''!x'' or ''qg''. In languages without {{IPA|/\u1d4f\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}}, such as Zulu, {{IPA|/\u1da2\u01c3/}} may be written ''gq''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Competing orthographies\n!rowspan=2| !!rowspan=2|labial!!colspan=2|laminal!!colspan=2|apical !!subapical\n|-\n!dental!!palatal!!alveolar!!lateral!!retroflex\n|- align=center\n!

However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click articulations will be found.\n\nFormerly when a click consonant was transcribed, two symbols were used, one for each articulation, and connected with a tie bar. This is because a click such as {{IPA|[\u014b\u0361\u01c2]}} was analysed as a nasal velar rear articulation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} pronounced simultaneously with the forward ingressive release {{IPA|[\u01c2]}}. The symbols may be written in either order, depending on the analysis: {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0361\u01c2}} or {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361\u014b}}. However, a tie bar was not often used in practice, and when the manner is [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (a simple {{IPA|[k]}}), it was often omitted as well. That is, {{angbr IPA|\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2k}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k}}. Regardless, elements that do not overlap with the forward release are usually written according to their temporal order: Prenasalisation is always written first ({{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0261\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u0361\u0261}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u032c}}), and the non-lingual part of a contour is always written second ({{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc}}).\n\nHowever, it has become standard to analyse clicks as simplex segments, despite the fact that the front and rear articulations are independent, and to use diacritics to indicate the rear articulation and the accompaniment. At first this tended to be {{angbr IPA|\u1d4f\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2}} for {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2, \u0261\u0361\u01c2, \u014b\u0361\u01c2}}, based on the belief that the rear articulation was velar; but as it has become clear that the rear articulation is often uvular or even pharyngeal even when there is no velar\u2013uvular contrast, voicing and nasalisation diacritics more in keeping with the IPA have started to appear: {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0325, \u01c2\u032c, \u01c2\u0303, \u014b\u01c2\u032c}} for {{angbr IPA|\u1d4f\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2, \u014b\u1da2\u01c2}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|+Evolution of accompaniment transcription\n|-\n! !!

However, the palatal and alveolar clicks frequently had conflicting names in older literature, and still do in Unicode. However, since Ladefoged & Traill (1984) clarified the places of articulation, the terms listed under Vosser (2013) have become standard, apart from details such as whether {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}} are alveolar and postalveolar, or {{IPA|\u0298}} is bilabial or labiodental, in a particular language, or whether the rear articulation is velar, uvular or pharyngeal, which again varies between languages (or may even be contrastive within a language).\n\n==The back-vowel constraint==\n[[Image:Clicks and the BVC.svg|thumb|The shape of the tongue in Nama when articulating an alveolar click (blue) and a palatal click (red) [throat to the right]. The articulation of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is slightly forward of the red line, with its peak coinciding with the dip of the blue line.]]\nIn several languages, including [[Nama language|Nama]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan dialect|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], the alveolar click types {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} and {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} only occur, or preferentially occur, before [[back vowel]]s, whereas the dental and palatal clicks occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable with the high front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. In Nama, for example, the diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} is common but {{IPA|[i]}} is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas the opposite is true after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or uvularised consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In [[Taa language|Taa]], for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar clicks and uvular stops, but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as {{IPA|*/\u01c3i/}} and {{IPA|*/qi/}} are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as {{IPA|/\u01c2i/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} are common. It is also triggered by labial clicks, though not by labial stops. Clicks subject to this constraint involve a sharp [[retracted tongue root|retraction]] of the tongue during release.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n! !!Abrupt <br>release!!Noisy <br>release\n|-\n|ballistic tongue retraction<br>& back-vowel constraint\n|align=center|\u01c3||align=center|\u01c1, \u0298\n|-\n|no retraction, no constraint\n|align=center|\u01c2||align=center|\u01c0\n|}\n\nMiller and colleagues (2003) used [[ultrasound imaging]] to show that the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c3]}}) in Nama is substantially different from that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very similar to that of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}} involved a simple and quick transition. The rear articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimetres further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is deeply retracted in {{IPA|[\u01c3]}}, as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} takes 50 [[millisecond|ms]] longer to pronounce than {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}}, the same amount of time required to pronounce {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0259i]}}.\n\nLanguages do not all behave alike. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c0uu]], the simple clicks {{IPA|/\u0298, \u01c3, \u01c1/}} trigger the {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|/\u01c0, \u01c2/}} do not. All of the affricated contour clicks, such as {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}}, do as well, as do the uvular stops {{IPA|/q, \u03c7/}}. However, the occlusive contour clicks pattern like the simple clicks, and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} does not trigger the back-vowel constraint. This is because they involve tongue-root raising rather than [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue-root retraction]] in the uvular-pharyngeal region. However, in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]], which is otherwise largely similar, both {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}} trigger the back-vowel constraint (Miller 2009).\n\n==Manners of articulation==\n{{main|nasal click|glottalised click|pulmonic-contour click|ejective-contour click}}\nClick manners are often called click ''accompaniments'' or ''effluxes'', but both terms have met with objections on theoretical grounds.\n\nThere is a great variety of click manners, both simplex and complex, the latter variously analysed as consonant [[consonant cluster|clusters]] or [[contour (linguistics)|contours]]. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages are equivalent. For example, the {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Khoekhoe, {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u02c0\u01c3k]}} of Sandawe and {{IPA|[\u014b\u030a\u01c3\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Hadza may be essentially the same phone; no language distinguishes them, and the differences in transcription may have more to do with the approach of the linguist than with actual differences in the sounds. Such suspected allophones/allographs are listed on a common row in the table below.\n\nSome Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters/contours, such as {{IPA|dt\u0361s\u02bck\u0361x\u02bc}}, so it is not surprising that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well. This may be an effect of epiglottalised voiced consonants, because voicing is incompatible with epiglottalisation.\n\n===Phonation===\nAs do other consonants, clicks vary in [[phonation]]. Oral clicks are attested with four phonations: [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and [[breathy voice]]d (murmured). Nasal clicks may also vary, with plain voiced, breathy voiced / murmured nasal, aspirated and unaspirated voiceless clicks attested (the last only in Taa). The aspirated nasal clicks are often said to have 'delayed aspiration'; there is nasal airflow throughout the click, which may become voiced between vowels, though the aspiration itself is voiceless. A few languages also have pre-glottalised nasal clicks, which have very brief prenasalisation<!--creaky-voiced nasal?--> but have not been phonetically analysed to the extent that other types of clicks have.\n\nAll languages have nasal clicks, and all but [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] and [[Damin]] also have oral clicks. All languages but Damin have at least one phonation contrast as well.\n\n===Complex clicks===\nClicks may be pronounced with a third place of articulation, glottal. A [[glottal stop]] is made during the hold of the click; the (necessarily voiceless) click is released, and then the glottal hold is released into the vowel. Glottalised clicks are very common, and they are generally nasalised as well. The nasalisation cannot be heard during the click release, as there is no pulmonic airflow, and generally not at all when the click occurs at the beginning of an utterance, but it has the effect of nasalising preceding vowels, to the extent that the glottalised clicks of Sandawe and Hadza are often described as prenasalised when in medial position. Two languages, [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]], contrast plain and nasal glottalised clicks, but in languages without such a contrast, the glottalised click is nasal. Miller (2011) analyses the glottalisation as phonation, and so considers these to be simple clicks.\n\nVarious languages also have prenasalised clicks, which may be analysed as consonant sequences. [[Sotho language|Sotho]], for example, allows a syllabic nasal before its three clicks, as in ''nnqane'' 'the other side' (prenasalised nasal) and ''seqhenqha'' 'hunk'.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion as to how the distinction between what were historically described as 'velar' and 'uvular' clicks is best described. The 'uvular' clicks are only found in some languages, and have an extended pronunciation that suggests that they are more complex than the simple ('velar') clicks, which are found in all. Nakagawa (1996) describes the extended clicks in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] as [[consonant cluster]]s, sequences equivalent to English ''st'' or ''pl'', whereas Miller (2011) analyses similar sounds in several languages as click\u2013non-click [[contour (linguistics)|contours]], where a click transitions into a pulmonic or ejective articulation within a single segment, analogous to how English ''ch'' and ''j'' transition from occlusive to fricative but still behave as unitary sounds. With ejective clicks, for example, Miller finds that although the ejective release follows the click release, it is the rear closure of the click that is ejective, not an independently articulated consonant. That is, in a simple click, the release of the rear articulation is not audible, whereas in a contour click, the rear (uvular) articulation is audibly released after the front (click) articulation, resulting in a double release.\n\nThese contour clicks may be ''linguo-pulmonic'', that is, they may transition from a click (lingual) articulation to a normal pulmonic consonant like {{IPAblink|q}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q]}}); or ''linguo-glottalic'' and transition from lingual to an ejective consonant like {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc]}}): that is, a sequence of ingressive (lingual) release + egressive (pulmonic or glottalic) release. In some cases there is a shift in place of articulation as well, and instead of a uvular release, the uvular click transitions to a velar or [[Epiglottal consonant|epigottal]] release (depending on the description, {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} or {{IPA|[\u01c2\u1d34]}}). Although [[homorganic]] {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361\u03c7\u02bc]}} does not contrast with heterorganic {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} in any known language, they are phonetically quite distinct (Miller 2011).\n\nApart from Dahalo, Damin and many of the Bantu languages (Yeyi and Xhosa being exceptions), 'click' languages have glottalised clicks. Contour clicks are restricted to southern Africa, but are very common there: they are found in all members of the Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe families, as well as in the Bantu language Yeyi.\n\n===Variation among languages===\nIn a comparative study of clicks across various languages, using her own field work as well as phonetic descriptions and data by other field researchers, Miller (2011) posits 21 types of clicks that contrast in manner or airstream.<ref group=note>Not counting the egressive \"spurt\" in Damin, and tree additional voiced manners in Western \u01c3Xoo, which pair up with voiceless manners.</ref> The [[homorganic]] and heterorganic affricated ejective clicks do not contrast in any known language, but are judged dissimilar enough to keep separate. Miller's conclusions differ from those of the primary researcher of a language; see the individual languages for details.\n* [[Taa language|Taa]] (\u01c3X\u00f3\u00f5) and [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]] (N\u01c0uu) are [[Tuu languages]], from the two branches of that family.\n* [[\u01c2\u02bcAmkoe language|\u01c2\u02bcAmkoe]] (\u01c2Hoan) and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]] (\u01c3Kung) are [[Kx\u02bca languages]], from the two branches of that family.\n* [[Korana language|Korana]] and [[G\u01c0wi language|G\u01c0ui]] (G\u01c1ana) are [[Khoe languages]], from the two branches of that family.\n(all spoken primarily in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]]; [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] is like Korana except it has lost ejective {{IPA|/\u1d4f\ua7b0\u0361\u03c7\u02bc/}})\n* [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] are [[language isolate]]s spoken in [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] is a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language of [[Kenya]]\n* [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]] are [[Bantu languages]], from the two geographic areas of that family that have acquired clicks.\n([[Zulu language|Zulu]] is like Xhosa apart from not having {{IPA|/\u1d51\ua7b0\u02c0/}})\n* [[Damin]] was an initiation jargon in northern [[Australia]].\n\nEach language below is illustrated with \ua7b0 as a placeholder for the different click types.

The original researchers believe that {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u02b0]}} and {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u03c7]}} are allophones.\n\nA DoBeS (2008) study of the Western \u01c3Xoo dialect of Taa found several new manners: creaky voiced (the voiced equivalent of glottalised oral), breathy-voiced nasal, prenasalised glottalised (the voiced equivalent of glottalised) and a (pre)voiced ejective. These extra voiced clicks reflect Western \u01c3Xoo morphology, where many nouns form their plural by voicing their initial consonant. DoBeS analyses most Taa clicks as clusters, leaving nine basic manners (marked with asterisks in the table). This comes close to Miller's distinction between simple and contour clicks, shaded light and medium grey in the table.\n\n==Phonotactics==\nLanguages of the southern African Khoisan families only permit clicks at the beginning of a word root. However, they also restrict other classes of consonant, such as [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] and [[affricate]]s, to root-initial position. The Bantu languages, Hadza and Sandawe allow clicks within roots.\n\nIn some languages, all click consonants within known roots are the same phoneme, as in Hadza ''cikiringcingca'' {{IPA|/\u01c0iki\u027aiN.\u01c0iN.\u01c0a/}} 'pinkie finger', which has three [[tenuis dental click]]s. Other languages are known to have the occasional root with different clicks, as in Xhosa ''ugqwanxa'' {{IPA|/u\u1da2\u030a\u01c3\u02b1\u02b7a\u1d51\u01c1a/}} '[[Olea capensis|black ironwood]]', which has a slack-[[voiced alveolar click]] and a [[nasal lateral click]].\n\nLike other articulatorily complex consonants, clicks tend to be found in [[lexical words]] rather than in [[grammatical word]]s, but this is only a tendency. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]], for example, there are two sets of [[personal pronoun]]s, a full one without clicks and a partial set with clicks (''\u0144g'' 'I', ''\u00e1'' 'thou', ''\u00ed'' 'we all', ''\u00fa'' 'you', vs. ''n\u01c0\u01f9g'' 'I', ''g\u01c0\u00e0'' 'thou', ''g\u01c0\u00ec'' 'we all', ''g\u01c0\u00f9'' 'you'), as well as other grammatical words with clicks such as ''\u01c1u'' 'not' and ''n\u01c0a'' 'with, and'.\n\n==Click genesis and click loss==\nOne genetic study concluded that clicks, which occur in the languages of the genetically divergent populations Hadza and !Kung, may be an ancient element of human language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tishkoff |first=S. A. |last2=Gonder |first2=M. K. |last3=Henn |first3=B.

How they arose is not known, but it is generally assumed that they developed from sequences of non-click consonants, as they are found allophonically for [[doubly articulated consonant]]s in West Africa,{{sfn|Ladefoged|1968}} where {{IPA|/tk/}} sequences overlap at word boundaries in German,<ref name=germ /> and for the sequence {{IPA|/mw/}} in [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Tonga language (Zambia)|Tonga]].<ref group=note>Here the labial {{IPA|[m]}} may have assimilated to the velar place of the {{IPA|[w]}}, as {{IPA|[m\u0361\u014bw]}}, with the release of the labial before the velar later generating a click {{IPA|[\u1d50\u0298w]}}</ref> Such developments have also been posited in historical reconstruction. For example, the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] word for 'horn', {{IPA|/t\u026cana/}}, with a lateral affricate, may be a cognate with the root {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c1a\u02d0/}} found throughout the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]], which has a lateral click. This and other words suggests that at least some Khoe clicks may have formed from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word was lost; in this instance *{{IPA|[t\u026cana]}} > *{{IPA|[t\u026cna]}} > {{IPA|[\u01c1\u014ba] ~ [\u1d51\u01c1a]}}.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, several non-endangered languages in vigorous use demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[Khoe languages|East Kalahari languages]] have lost clicks from a large percentage of their vocabulary, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. As a rule, a click is replaced by a consonant with close to the [[manner of articulation]] of the click and the [[place of articulation]] of the forward release: alveolar click releases (the {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} family) tend to mutate into a velar stop or affricate, such as {{IPA|[k], [\u0261], [\u014b], [k\u0361x]}}; palatal clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c2]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into a palatal stop such as {{IPA|[c], [&thinsp;\u025f], [&thinsp;\u0272], [c\u02bc]}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|[t\u0283], [d\u0292]}}; and dental clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c0]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into an alveolar affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Difficulty==\nClicks are often presented as difficult sounds to articulate within words. However, children acquire them readily; a two-year-old, for example, may be able to pronounce a word with a lateral click {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} with no problem, but still be unable to pronounce {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref>Kirk Miller, 'Highlights of Hadza fieldwork'.

Examples familiar to English-speakers are the ''[[Tut-tut]]'' (British spelling) or ''Tsk! Tsk!'' (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the ''[[lateral click|tchick!]]'' used to spur on a horse, and the ''[[alveolar click|clip-clop!]]'' sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.\n\nTechnically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The enclosed pocket of air is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released,<ref group=note>This is the case for all clicks that constitute consonants in words. Paralinguistically, however, there are other methods of making clicks: ''under'' the tongue and by releasing the rear occlusion first. See [[#Places of articulation]].</ref> producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, but in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]].\n\n==Notation and sound description==\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|ejectives=no|implosives=no|audio=yes|class=infobox}}\n{{infobox symbol\n|mark = \u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c2 \u01c3 \u0298\n|name=Click consonants\n|unicode=\n{{unichar|01C0|Latin letter dental click}}<br />\n{{unichar|01C1|Latin letter lateral click}}<br  />\n{{unichar|01C2|Latin letter alveolar click}}<br  />\n{{unichar|01C3|Latin letter retroflex click}}<br  />\n{{unichar|0298|Latin letter bilabial click}}\n|different from=\n{{unichar|007C|Vertical line| nlink=Vertical bar}}<br />\n{{unichar|2016|Double vertical line|nlink=Vertical bar}}\n}}\nClick consonants occur at six principal places of articulation. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] may represent a click by placing the assigned symbol for five of the places of articulation (there is as yet no dedicated symbol for the sixth) adjacent to a symbol for a non-click sound at the rear place of articulation, or the click symbol may be combined with diacritics for voicing, nasalization, etc. The IPA symbols are used in writing most [[Khoisan languages]], but [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] typically use [[Latin script|Latin]] {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|x}} and {{angbr|q}} for dental, lateral and alveolar clicks respectively.\n* The easiest clicks for English speakers are the [[dental click]]s written with a single pipe, {{IPA|\u01c0}}. They are all sharp (high-pitched) squeaky sounds made by sucking on the front teeth. A simple dental click is used in English to express pity or to shame someone, and sometimes to call an animal, and is written ''tut!'' in British English and ''tsk!'' in American English. In Italian this sound means \"no\" used as an answer to a direct question, while it is used to call cats when repeated several times.\n* Next most familiar to English speakers are the [[lateral click]]s written with a double pipe, {{IPA|\u01c1}}. They are also squeaky sounds, though less sharp than {{IPA|\u01c0}}, made by sucking on the molars on either side (or both sides) of the mouth. A simple lateral click is made in English to get a horse moving, and is conventionally written ''tchick!''\n* Then there are the [[labial click]]s, written with a bull's eye, {{IPA|\u0298}}. These are lip-smacking sounds, but without the pursing of the lips found in a kiss.\n\nThe above clicks sound like [[affricate]]s, in that they involve a lot of friction. The other two families are more abrupt sounds that do not have this friction.\n* With the [[alveolar click]]s, written with an exclamation mark, {{IPA|\u01c3}}, the tip of the tongue is pulled down abruptly and forcefully from the roof of the mouth, sometimes using a lot of jaw motion, and making a hollow ''pop!'' like a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. These sounds can be quite loud.\n* Finally, for most languages, the [[palatal click]]s, {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are made with a flat tongue, and are sharper popping sounds than the {{IPA|\u01c3}} clicks, like sharply snapped fingers.\n\n==Languages with clicks==\n\n=== Southern Africa ===\nClicks occur in all three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language families]] of [[southern Africa]], where they may be the most numerous consonants. To a lesser extent they occur in three neighbouring groups of [[Bantu languages]]\u2014which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]], directly or indirectly, from Khoisan. In the southeast, in eastern [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]] and southern [[Mozambique]], they were adopted from a [[Tuu languages|Tuu language]] or languages by the languages of the Nguni cluster (especially [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], but also to a lesser extent [[Swati language|Swazi]] and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), and spread from them in a reduced fashion to the Zulu-based [[pidgin]] [[Fanagalo]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Ronga language|Ronga]], the Mzimba dialect of [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]] and more recently to [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]], where the spread of clicks continues. The second point of transfer was near the [[Caprivi Strip]] and the [[Okavango River]] where, apparently, the [[Yeyi language]] borrowed the clicks from a [[Khoe languages|West Kalahari Khoe language]]; a separate development led to a smaller click inventory in the neighbouring [[Mbukushu language|Mbukushu]], [[Kwangali language|Kwangali]], [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], [[Kuhane language|Kuhane]] and [[Fwe language|Fwe]] languages in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]].<ref>Derek Nurse & G\u00e9rard Philippson (2003) ''The Bantu languages,'' pp 31\u201332</ref> These sounds occur not only in borrowed vocabulary, but have spread to native Bantu words as well, in the case of Nguni at least partially due to a type of word taboo called [[hlonipha]]. Some [[creolised]] varieties of Afrikaans, such as [[Oorlams Creole|Oorlams]], retain clicks in Khoekhoe words.\n\n=== East Africa ===\nThree languages in [[East Africa]] use clicks: [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], and [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]] that has clicks in only a few dozen words. It is thought the latter may remain from an episode of [[language shift]].\n\n=== Damin ===\nThe only non-African language known to have clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a ritual code once used by speakers of [[Lardil language|Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an [[Egressive sound|egressive]] click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) \"spurt\".\n\n===Spread of clicks from loanwords===\nOnce clicks are borrowed into a language as regular speech sounds, they may spread to native words, as has happened due to ''[[hlonipa]]'' word-taboo in the [[Nguni languages]]. In [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], for example, the European loanword ''tomate'' (tomato) appears as ''cum\u00e1te'' with a click ''c'', though it begins with a ''t'' in all neighbouring languages.\n\n=== Marginal usage of clicks ===\nScattered clicks are found in [[ideophone]]s and mimesis in other languages, such as [[Kongo language|Kongo]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3/}}, [[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c0/}} and Hadza {{IPA|/\u1d51\u0298\u02b7/}} (Hadza does not otherwise have labial clicks). Ideophones often use phonemic distinctions not found in normal vocabulary.\n\nEnglish and many other languages may use bare clicks in [[interjection]]s, without the accompaniment of vowels, such as the dental \"tsk-tsk\" sound used to express disapproval, or the lateral ''tchick'' used with horses. In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], occasionally in [[French language|French]], as well as southern Italian languages such as [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], in which a bare dental click accompanied by tipping the head upwards signifies \"no\". [[Libyan Arabic]] apparently has three such sounds.\n\nClicks occasionally turn up elsewhere, as in the special [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] twins sometimes develop with each other.

This is usually a misnomer for [[ejective consonant]]s, which are found across much of the world.\n\n=== Position in word ===\nFor the most part, the Southern African [[Khoisan languages]] only use [[root word|root]]-initial clicks.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions occurs in words borrowed from Bantu languages, which may have click in the middle.</ref> Hadza, Sandawe and several [[Bantu languages]] also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots. In no language does a click close a syllable or end a word, but then the languages that happen to have clicks have mostly CV syllables and allow at most only a limited set of consonants (such as a nasal or a glottal stop) to close a syllable or end a word, most consonants share the distribution of clicks in these languages.\n\n=== Types of clicks used ===\nThe Khoesan families (Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe) all have at least four click types, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}} or variants thereof. A few have five, with bilabial {{IPA|{\u0298}}} or retroflex {{IPA|{\u203c}}}. Hadza and Sandawe have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}. Yeyi is the only Bantu language with four, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}}, while Xhosa and Zulu have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}, and most Bantu languages with clicks have fewer than that.\n\n==Types of clicks==\nLike other consonants, clicks can be described using four parameters: [[place of articulation]], [[manner of articulation]], [[phonation]] (including glottalisation) and [[airstream mechanism]]. As noted above, clicks necessarily involve at least two closures, which in some cases operate partially independently: an anterior articulation traditionally represented by the special click symbol in the IPA\u2014and a posterior articulation traditionally described as oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. The literature also describes a contrast between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] rear articulations for some languages.\n\nHowever, recent work shows that in languages that make this distinction, all clicks have a uvular, or even pharyngeal, rear closure\u2014and the clicks explicitly described as uvular are in fact clusters/contours of a click plus a pulmonic or ejective component, in which the cluster/contour has two release bursts, the forward (click) and then the rearward (uvular) component. \"Velar\" clicks in these languages have only a single release burst, that of the forward click release, and the release of the rear articulation isn't separately audible (Miller 2011).\n\nNonetheless, in most of the literature the stated place of the click is the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx),'' whereas the manner is ascribed to the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux).'' The anterior articulation defines the ''click type'' and is written with the IPA letter for the click (dental {{angbr IPA|\u01c0}}, alveolar {{angbr IPA|\u01c3}}, etc.), whereas the traditional term 'accompaniment' conflates the categories of manner (nasal, affricated), phonation (voiced, aspirated, breathy voiced, glottalised), as well as any change in the airstream with the release of the posterior articulation (pulmonic, ejective), all of which are transcribed with additional letters or diacritics, as in the ''nasal alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u01c3\u014b}} or {{angbr IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}} or\u2014to take an extreme example\u2014the ''voiced (uvular) ejective alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u1da2\u01c3\u0361q\u02bc}}.\n\nThe size of click inventories ranges from as few as three (in [[Sesotho phonology#Consonants|Sesotho]]) or four (in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]]), to dozens in the [[Kx\u02bca languages|Kx\u02bca]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] (Northern and Southern Khoisan) languages. [[Taa language|Taa]], the last vibrant language in the latter family, has 45 to 115 click phonemes, depending on analysis (clusters vs. contours), and over 70% of words in the dictionary of this language begin with a click.<ref>L&M 1996, p 246</ref>\n\nClicks appear more [[stop consonant|stop]]-like (sharp/abrupt) or [[affricate]]-like (noisy) depending on their place of articulation: In southern Africa, clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp, like stops, whereas [[labial consonant|labial]], [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks typically have longer and acoustically noisier click types that are superficially more like affricates. In East Africa, however, the alveolar clicks tend to be [[flap consonant|flapped]], whereas the lateral clicks tend to be more sharp.\n\n==Transcription==\n{{further|click letter}}\nThe five click places of articulation with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[labial click|labial]] {{IPA|\u0298}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|\u01c0}}, [[palatal click|palatal]] (\"palato-alveolar\") {{IPA|\u01c2}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] (\"retroflex\") {{IPA|\u01c3}} and [[lateral click|lateral]] {{IPA|\u01c1}}. In most languages, the alveolar and palatal types are abrupt; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The labial, dental and lateral types, on the other hand, are typically noisy: they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (This applies to the forward articulation; both may also have either an affricate or non-affricate rear articulation as well.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] places, {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}}, are sometimes called \"grave\", because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; whereas the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] places, {{IPA|\u01c0}} and {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are sometimes called \"acute\", because they are dominated by high frequencies. (At least in the [[N\u01c1ng language]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], this is associated with a difference in the placement of the rear articulation: \"grave\" clicks are [[uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas \"acute\" clicks are [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]].) Thus the alveolar click {{IPA|/\u01c3/}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low-pitch pop), at least in Xhosa; whereas the dental click {{IPA|/\u01c0/}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!,'' a high-pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The labial click {{IPA|/\u0298/}} is different from what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a {{IPA|[p]}} or an {{IPA|[m]}}, not rounded as they are for a {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nThe most populous languages with clicks, Zulu and Xhosa, use the letters ''c, q, x,'' by themselves and in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], to write click consonants. Most Khoisan languages, on the other hand (with the notable exceptions of [[Naro language|Naro]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]), use a more iconic system based on the [[Vertical bar|pipe]] {{angbr|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}}. (The exclamation point for the \"retroflex\" click was originally a pipe with a subscript dot, along the lines of ''\u1e6d, \u1e0d, \u1e47'' used to transcribe the retroflex consonants of India.) There are also two main conventions for the second letter of the digraph as well: voicing may be written with ''g'' and uvular affrication with ''x'', or voicing with ''d'' and affrication with ''g'' (a convention of Afrikaans). In two orthographies of Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, for example, voiced {{IPA|/\u1da2\u01c3/}} is written ''g!'' or ''dq'', and {{IPA|/\u1d4f\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}} ''!x'' or ''qg''. In languages without {{IPA|/\u1d4f\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}}, such as Zulu, {{IPA|/\u1da2\u01c3/}} may be written ''gq''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Competing orthographies\n!rowspan=2| !!rowspan=2|labial!!colspan=2|laminal!!colspan=2|apical !!subapical\n|-\n!dental!!palatal!!alveolar!!lateral!!retroflex\n|- align=center\n!

Doke and Beach used [[click letters|additional or modified letters]] for voiced and nasal clicks, but they did not catch on.\n# {{note|pal}} The labial and palatal clicks do not occur in written Bantu languages. However, the palatal clicks have been romanised in Naron, [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5asi]] and !Xun,{{which|date=December 2012}} where they have been written {{angbr|tc}}, {{angbr|\u00e7}} and {{angbr|qc}}, respectively. In the 19th century, they were sometimes written {{angbr|v}}, which might be source of the Doke letter {{angbr|\u2186}}.\n\nThere are a few less-well-attested articulations. <!--Note: the 2nd lateral click in Mangetti Dune could not be reproduced, and the authors have retracted their claim (vd. Miller & Shah 2009).

However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click articulations will be found.\n\nFormerly when a click consonant was transcribed, two symbols were used, one for each articulation, and connected with a tie bar. This is because a click such as {{IPA|[\u014b\u0361\u01c2]}} was analysed as a nasal velar rear articulation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} pronounced simultaneously with the forward ingressive release {{IPA|[\u01c2]}}. The symbols may be written in either order, depending on the analysis: {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0361\u01c2}} or {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361\u014b}}. However, a tie bar was not often used in practice, and when the manner is [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (a simple {{IPA|[k]}}), it was often omitted as well. That is, {{angbr IPA|\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2k}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k}}. Regardless, elements that do not overlap with the forward release are usually written according to their temporal order: Prenasalisation is always written first ({{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0261\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u0361\u0261}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u032c}}), and the non-lingual part of a contour is always written second ({{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc}}).\n\nHowever, it has become standard to analyse clicks as simplex segments, despite the fact that the front and rear articulations are independent, and to use diacritics to indicate the rear articulation and the accompaniment. At first this tended to be {{angbr IPA|\u1d4f\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2}} for {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2, \u0261\u0361\u01c2, \u014b\u0361\u01c2}}, based on the belief that the rear articulation was velar; but as it has become clear that the rear articulation is often uvular or even pharyngeal even when their is no velar\u2013uvular contrast, voicing and nasalisation diacritics more in keeping with the IPA have started to appear: {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0325, \u01c2\u032c, \u01c2\u0303, \u014b\u01c2\u032c}} for {{angbr IPA|\u1d4f\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2, \u014b\u1da2\u01c2}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|+Evolution of accompaniment transcription\n|-\n! !!

However, the palatal and alveolar clicks frequently had conflicting names in older literature, and still do in Unicode. However, since Ladefoged & Traill (1984) clarified the places of articulation, the terms listed under Vosser (2013) have become standard, apart from details such as whether {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}} are alveolar and postalveolar, or {{IPA|\u0298}} is bilabial or labiodental, in a particular language, or whether the rear articulation is velar, uvular or pharyngeal, which again varies between languages (or may even be contrastive within a language).\n\n==The back-vowel constraint==\n[[Image:Clicks and the BVC.svg|thumb|The shape of the tongue in Nama when articulating an alveolar click (blue) and a palatal click (red) [throat to the right]. The articulation of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is slightly forward of the red line, with its peak coinciding with the dip of the blue line.]]\nIn several languages, including [[Nama language|Nama]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan dialect|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], the alveolar click types {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} and {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} only occur, or preferentially occur, before [[back vowel]]s, whereas the dental and palatal clicks occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable with the high front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. In Nama, for example, the diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} is common but {{IPA|[i]}} is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas the opposite is true after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or uvularised consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In [[Taa language|Taa]], for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar clicks and uvular stops, but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as {{IPA|*/\u01c3i/}} and {{IPA|*/qi/}} are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as {{IPA|/\u01c2i/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} are common. It is also triggered by labial clicks, though not by labial stops. Clicks subject to this constraint involve a sharp [[retracted tongue root|retraction]] of the tongue during release.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n! !!Abrupt <br>release!!Noisy <br>release\n|-\n|ballistic tongue retraction<br>& back-vowel constraint\n|align=center|\u01c3||align=center|\u01c1, \u0298\n|-\n|no retraction, no constraint\n|align=center|\u01c2||align=center|\u01c0\n|}\n\nMiller and colleagues (2003) used [[ultrasound imaging]] to show that the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c3]}}) in Nama is substantially different from that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very similar to that of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}} involved a simple and quick transition. The rear articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimetres further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is deeply retracted in {{IPA|[\u01c3]}}, as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} takes 50 [[millisecond|ms]] longer to pronounce than {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}}, the same amount of time required to pronounce {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0259i]}}.\n\nLanguages do not all behave alike. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c0uu]], the simple clicks {{IPA|/\u0298, \u01c3, \u01c1/}} trigger the {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|/\u01c0, \u01c2/}} do not. All of the affricated contour clicks, such as {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}}, do as well, as do the uvular stops {{IPA|/q, \u03c7/}}. However, the occlusive contour clicks pattern like the simple clicks, and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} does not trigger the back-vowel constraint. This is because they involve tongue-root raising rather than [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue-root retraction]] in the uvular-pharyngeal region. However, in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]], which is otherwise largely similar, both {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}} trigger the back-vowel constraint (Miller 2009).\n\n==Manners of articulation==\n{{main|nasal click|glottalised click|pulmonic-contour click|ejective-contour click}}\nClick manners are often called click ''accompaniments'' or ''effluxes'', but both terms have met with objections on theoretical grounds.\n\nThere is a great variety of click manners, both simplex and complex, the latter variously analysed as consonant [[consonant cluster|clusters]] or [[contour (linguistics)|contours]]. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages are equivalent. For example, the {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Khoekhoe, {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u02c0\u01c3k]}} of Sandawe and {{IPA|[\u014b\u030a\u01c3\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Hadza may be essentially the same phone; no language distinguishes them, and the differences in transcription may have more to do with the approach of the linguist than with actual differences in the sounds. Such suspected allophones/allographs are listed on a common row in the table below.\n\nSome Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters/contours, such as {{IPA|dt\u0361s\u02bck\u0361x\u02bc}}, so it is not surprising that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well. This may be an effect of epiglottalised voiced consonants, because voicing is incompatible with epiglottalisation.\n\n===Phonation===\nAs do other consonants, clicks vary in [[phonation]]. Oral clicks are attested with four phonations: [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and [[breathy voice]]d (murmured). Nasal clicks may also vary, with plain voiced, breathy voiced / murmured nasal, aspirated and unaspirated voiceless clicks attested (the last only in Taa). The aspirated nasal clicks are often said to have 'delayed aspiration'; there is nasal airflow throughout the click, which may become voiced between vowels, though the aspiration itself is voiceless. A few languages also have pre-glottalised nasal clicks, which have very brief prenasalisation<!--creaky-voiced nasal?--> but have not been phonetically analysed to the extent that other types of clicks have.\n\nAll languages have nasal clicks, and all but [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] and [[Damin]] also have oral clicks. All languages but Damin have at least one phonation contrast as well.\n\n===Complex clicks===\nClicks may be pronounced with a third place of articulation, glottal. A [[glottal stop]] is made during the hold of the click; the (necessarily voiceless) click is released, and then the glottal hold is released into the vowel. Glottalised clicks are very common, and they are generally nasalised as well. The nasalisation cannot be heard during the click release, as there is no pulmonic airflow, and generally not at all when the click occurs at the beginning of an utterance, but it has the effect of nasalising preceding vowels, to the extent that the glottalised clicks of Sandawe and Hadza are often described as prenasalised when in medial position. Two languages, [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]], contrast plain and nasal glottalised clicks, but in languages without such a contrast, the glottalised click is nasal. Miller (2011) analyses the glottalisation as phonation, and so considers these to be simple clicks.\n\nVarious languages also have prenasalised clicks, which may be analysed as consonant sequences. [[Sotho language|Sotho]], for example, allows a syllabic nasal before its three clicks, as in ''nnqane'' 'the other side' (prenasalised nasal) and ''seqhenqha'' 'hunk'.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion as to how the distinction between what were historically described as 'velar' and 'uvular' clicks is best described. The 'uvular' clicks are only found in some languages, and have an extended pronunciation that suggests that they are more complex than the simple ('velar') clicks, which are found in all. Nakagawa (1996) describes the extended clicks in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] as [[consonant cluster]]s, sequences equivalent to English ''st'' or ''pl'', whereas Miller (2011) analyses similar sounds in several languages as click\u2013non-click [[contour (linguistics)|contours]], where a click transitions into a pulmonic or ejective articulation within a single segment, analogous to how English ''ch'' and ''j'' transition from occlusive to fricative but still behave as unitary sounds. With ejective clicks, for example, Miller finds that although the ejective release follows the click release, it is the rear closure of the click that is ejective, not an independently articulated consonant. That is, in a simple click, the release of the rear articulation is not audible, whereas in a contour click, the rear (uvular) articulation is audibly released after the front (click) articulation, resulting in a double release.\n\nThese contour clicks may be ''linguo-pulmonic'', that is, they may transition from a click (lingual) articulation to a normal pulmonic consonant like {{IPAblink|q}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q]}}); or ''linguo-glottalic'' and transition from lingual to an ejective consonant like {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc]}}): that is, a sequence of ingressive (lingual) release + egressive (pulmonic or glottalic) release. In some cases there is a shift in place of articulation as well, and instead of a uvular release, the uvular click transitions to a velar or [[Epiglottal consonant|epigottal]] release (depending on the description, {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} or {{IPA|[\u01c2\u1d34]}}). Although [[homorganic]] {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361\u03c7\u02bc]}} does not contrast with heterorganic {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} in any known language, they are phonetically quite distinct (Miller 2011).\n\nApart from Dahalo, Damin and many of the Bantu languages (Yeyi and Xhosa being exceptions), 'click' languages have glottalised clicks. Contour clicks are restricted to southern Africa, but are very common there: they are found in all members of the Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe families, as well as in the Bantu language Yeyi.\n\n===Variation among languages===\nIn a comparative study of clicks across various languages, using her own field work as well as phonetic descriptions and data by other field researchers, Miller (2011) posits 21 types of clicks that contrast in manner or airstream.<ref group=note>Not counting the egressive \"spurt\" in Damin, and tree additional voiced manners in Western \u01c3Xoo, which pair up with voiceless manners.</ref> The [[homorganic]] and heterorganic affricated ejective clicks do not contrast in any known language, but are judged dissimilar enough to keep separate.

The original researchers believe that {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u02b0]}} and {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u03c7]}} are allophones.\n\nA DoBeS (2008) study of the Western \u01c3Xoo dialect of Taa found several new manners: creaky voiced (the voiced equivalent of glottalised oral), breathy-voiced nasal, prenasalised glottalised (the voiced equivalent of glottalised) and a (pre)voiced ejective. These extra voiced clicks reflect Western \u01c3Xoo morphology, where many nouns form their plural by voicing their initial consonant. DoBeS analyses most Taa clicks as clusters, leaving nine basic manners (marked with asterisks in the table). This comes close to Miller's distinction between simple and contour clicks, shaded light and medium grey in the table.\n\n==Phonotactics==\nLanguages of the southern African Khoisan families only permit clicks at the beginning of a word root. However, they also restrict other classes of consonant, such as [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] and [[affricate]]s, to root-initial position. The Bantu languages, Hadza and Sandawe allow clicks within roots.\n\nIn some languages, all click consonants within known roots are the same phoneme, as in Hadza ''cikiringcingca'' {{IPA|/\u01c0iki\u027aiN.\u01c0iN.\u01c0a/}} 'pinkie finger', which has three [[tenuis dental click]]s. Other languages are known to have the occasional root with different clicks, as in Xhosa ''ugqwanxa'' {{IPA|/u\u1da2\u030a\u01c3\u02b1\u02b7a\u1d51\u01c1a/}} '[[Olea capensis|black ironwood]]', which has a slack-[[voiced alveolar click]] and a [[nasal lateral click]].\n\nLike other articulatorily complex consonants, clicks tend to be found in [[lexical words]] rather than in [[grammatical word]]s, but this is only a tendency. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]], for example, there are two sets of [[personal pronoun]]s, a full one without clicks and a partial set with clicks (''\u0144g'' 'I', ''\u00e1'' 'thou', ''\u00ed'' 'we all', ''\u00fa'' 'you', vs. ''n\u01c0\u01f9g'' 'I', ''g\u01c0\u00e0'' 'thou', ''g\u01c0\u00ec'' 'we all', ''g\u01c0\u00f9'' 'you'), as well as other grammatical words with clicks such as ''\u01c1u'' 'not' and ''n\u01c0a'' 'with, and'.\n\n==Click genesis and click loss==\nOne genetic study concluded that clicks, which occur in the languages of the genetically divergent populations Hadza and !Kung, may be an ancient element of human language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tishkoff |first=S. A. |last2=Gonder |first2=M. K. |last3=Henn |first3=B. M. |last4=Mortensen |first4=H. |last5=Knight |first5=A. |last6=Gignoux |first6=C. |last7=Fernandopulle |first7=N. |displayauthors=3 |year=2007 |title=History of click-speaking populations of Africa inferred from mtDNA and Y chromosome genetic variation |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=2180\u201395 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm155 |pmid=17656633 |doi-access=free }}</ref> However, this conclusion relies on several dubious assumptions (see [[Hadza language]]), and most linguists{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} assume that clicks, being quite complex consonants, arose relatively late in human history. How they arose is not known, but it is generally assumed that they developed from sequences of non-click consonants, as they are found allophonically for [[doubly articulated consonant]]s in West Africa,{{sfn|Ladefoged|1968}} where {{IPA|/tk/}} sequences overlap at word boundaries in German,<ref name=germ /> and for the sequence {{IPA|/mw/}} in [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Tonga language (Zambia)|Tonga]].<ref group=note>Here the labial {{IPA|[m]}} may have assimilated to the velar place of the {{IPA|[w]}}, as {{IPA|[m\u0361\u014bw]}}, with the release of the labial before the velar later generating a click {{IPA|[\u1d50\u0298w]}}</ref> Such developments have also been posited in historical reconstruction. For example, the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] word for 'horn', {{IPA|/t\u026cana/}}, with a lateral affricate, may be a cognate with the root {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c1a\u02d0/}} found throughout the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]], which has a lateral click. This and other words suggests that at least some Khoe clicks may have formed from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word was lost; in this instance *{{IPA|[t\u026cana]}} > *{{IPA|[t\u026cna]}} > {{IPA|[\u01c1\u014ba] ~ [\u1d51\u01c1a]}}.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, several non-endangered languages in vigorous use demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[Khoe languages|East Kalahari languages]] have lost clicks from a large percentage of their vocabulary, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. As a rule, a click is replaced by a consonant with close to the [[manner of articulation]] of the click and the [[place of articulation]] of the forward release: alveolar click releases (the {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} family) tend to mutate into a velar stop or affricate, such as {{IPA|[k], [\u0261], [\u014b], [k\u0361x]}}; palatal clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c2]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into a palatal stop such as {{IPA|[c], [&thinsp;\u025f], [&thinsp;\u0272], [c\u02bc]}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|[t\u0283], [d\u0292]}}; and dental clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c0]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into an alveolar affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Difficulty==\nClicks are often presented as difficult sounds to articulate within words. However, children acquire them readily; a two-year-old, for example, may be able to pronounce a word with a lateral click {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} with no problem, but still be unable to pronounce {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref>Kirk Miller, 'Highlights of Hadza fieldwork'.

Whilst at Cambridge, Dunbar is reported to have been part of an elite set that included the infamous double agent Kim Philby<ref>{{cite web |title=Dunbar, Malcolm|url=https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/collections/dunbar-malcolm|website=bishopsgate.org.uk|publisher=[[Bishopsgate Institute]] |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Dunbar worked as journalist and photographer. He was commissioned by some of the leading ballet companies of the day - positions often facilitated by his mother. It was whilst working with Ballet Rambert that he met and forged a life-long friendship with the famous ballerina Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Langfield. During this time, Dunbar showed an interested in left wing political ideas and a dislike for Fascism, marching against Oswald Mosley\u2019s British Fascists in east London, October 1936.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of civil war in Spain in July 1936, Dunbar left London to join the anti-fascists on 5 January 1937. Once in Spain, Dunbar undertook two weeks training before being sent to the front line. He first saw action at the Battle of Jarama on 12 February 1937. As a new recruit, Dunbar had enlisted as a \u2018soldado\u2019 (private) but by 15 February he had been made group leader of the battalion. He continued in this role until his arm was injured in an attack against the Fascists in mid-January 1938.\n\nDunbar recuperated from his wound at Colmenar, Quintanar, Alcazar and Murcia before moving to Benicassim by 22 February. There, Dunbar was elected partially responsible for the English speaking front at the military hospital Villa Ralph Fox in Benicassim. He remained at the Villa until 10 March, when he returned to Albacete. Finding the 16th Battalion quartermaster unable to command his men, Dunbar took the opportunity to return to the Jarama Front. After the quartermaster returned, Dunbar was attached to the Battalion HQ in the capacity of interpreter. After another 3 weeks, he was sent back to Albacete and the officer school.\n\nDunbar continued to rise through the ranks. He became the most senior British ranking infantry officer in Spain when he served as the Chief of Staff for the entire 15th International Brigade at the Battle of the Ebro in July 1938.\nDunbar was demobilized in December 1938 having served 23 months.Unfortunately, the shy, taciturn Dunbar never gave any interviews on his time in Spain and information on him has always been fairly scarce, despite his high rank and illustrious record.\n\nDuring the Second World War Dunbar served in the British Army, but never rose above the rank of Sergeant, adding fuel to claims that veterans of the Spanish war were being discriminated against (Volunteer for Liberty citation needed). Nye Bevan cited him in support of a motion to censure the Churchill government in 1942.\n\n''\"The Prime Minister must realise that in this country there is a taunt on everyone's lips that if Rommel had been in the British Army he would still have been a sergeant ... There is a man in the British Army who flung 150,000 men across the Ebro in Spain, Michael Dunbar. He is at present a sergeant ... He was Chief of Staff in Spain, he won the Battle of the Ebro, and he is a sergeant.\"''<ref>{{cite web |title=Central Director of War |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1942-07-02/debates/64dacb26-408e-4010-aae7-dc5b54c7da0f/CentralDirectionOfTheWar?highlight=%22across%20the%20ebro%20in%20spain%22#contribution-cdd2d0bd-8165-4179-9919-30b190714717 |website=Handard|publisher=[[Hansard]] |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>.\n\nIt has been suggested that Dunbar was recommended for a commission, but rejected it himself to remain with his unit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baxell, |first1=Richard |title=Unlikely Warriors: The British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle Against Fascism |date=2012 |publisher=.

According to Richard Baxell although this looks like a clear case of suicide. Vincent Brome pointed out in Legions of Babel, his (now out of print) history of the International Brigades, the coroner declared an open verdict at the inquest, rather than declaring his death to have been suicide. This, and Dunbar\u2019s alleged relationship with the Cambridge spy, Kim Philby, have led to persistent rumours of official cover-ups and Secret Service skulduggery[4].\n\nFollowing his death, Malcolm Dunbar\u2019s papers were saved by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Langfield, whose partner contacted Richard Baxell. In June 2016, Baxell handed over the mass of material to the Bishopsgate Institute in London.

Whilst at Cambridge, Dunbar is reported to have been part of an elite set that included the infamous double agent Kim Philby<ref>{{cite web |title=Dunbar, Malcolm|url=https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/collections/dunbar-malcolm|website=bishopsgate.org.uk|publisher=[[Bishopsgate Institute]] |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Dunbar worked as journalist and photographer. He was commissioned by some of the leading ballet companies of the day - positions often facilitated by his mother. It was whilst working with Ballet Rambert that he met and forged a life-long friendship with the famous ballerina Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Langfield. During this time, Dunbar showed an interested in left wing political ideas and a dislike for Fascism, marching against Oswald Mosley\u2019s British Fascists in east London, October 1936.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of civil war in Spain in July 1936, Dunbar left London to join the anti-fascists on 5 January 1937. Once in Spain, Dunbar undertook two weeks training before being sent to the front line. He first saw action at the Battle of Jarama on 12 February 1937. As a new recruit, Dunbar had enlisted as a \u2018soldado\u2019 (private) but by 15 February he had been made group leader of the battalion. He continued in this role until his arm was injured in an attack against the Fascists in mid-January 1938.\n\nDunbar recuperated from his wound at Colmenar, Quintanar, Alcazar and Murcia before moving to Benicassim by 22 February. There, Dunbar was elected partially responsible for the English speaking front at the military hospital Villa Ralph Fox in Benicassim. He remained at the Villa until 10 March, when he returned to Albacete. Finding the 16th Battalion quartermaster unable to command his men, Dunbar took the opportunity to return to the Jarama Front. After the quartermaster returned, Dunbar was attached to the Battalion HQ in the capacity of interpreter. After another 3 weeks, he was sent back to Albacete and the officer school.\n\nDunbar continued to rise through the ranks. He became the most senior British ranking infantry officer in Spain when he served as the Chief of Staff for the entire 15th International Brigade at the Battle of the Ebro in July 1938.\nDunbar was demobilized in December 1938 having served 23 months.Unfortunately, the shy, taciturn Dunbar never gave any interviews on his time in Spain and information on him has always been fairly scarce, despite his high rank and illustrious record.\n\nDuring the Second World War Dunbar served in the British Army, but never rose above the rank of Sergeant, adding fuel to claims that veterans of the Spanish war were being discriminated against (Volunteer for Liberty citation needed). Nye Bevan cited him in support of a motion to censure the Churchill government in 1942.\n\n\"The Prime Minister must realise that in this country there is a taunt on everyone's lips that if Rommel had been in the British Army he would still have been a sergeant ... There is a man in the British Army who flung 150,000 men across the Ebro in Spain, Michael Dunbar. He is at present a sergeant ... He was Chief of Staff in Spain, he won the Battle of the Ebro, and he is a sergeant.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Central Director of War |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1942-07-02/debates/64dacb26-408e-4010-aae7-dc5b54c7da0f/CentralDirectionOfTheWar?highlight=%22across%20the%20ebro%20in%20spain%22#contribution-cdd2d0bd-8165-4179-9919-30b190714717 |website=Handard|publisher=[[Hansard]] |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>.\n\nIt has been suggested that Dunbar was recommended for a commission, but rejected it himself to remain with his unit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baxell, |first1=Richard |title=Unlikely Warriors: The British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle Against Fascism |date=2012 |publisher=.

According to Richard Baxell although this looks like a clear case of suicide. Vincent Brome pointed out in Legions of Babel, his (now out of print) history of the International Brigades, the coroner declared an open verdict at the inquest, rather than declaring his death to have been suicide. This, and Dunbar\u2019s alleged relationship with the Cambridge spy, Kim Philby, have led to persistent rumours of official cover-ups and Secret Service skulduggery[4].\n\nFollowing his death, Malcolm Dunbar\u2019s papers were saved by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Langfield, whose partner contacted Richard Baxell. In June 2016, Baxell handed over the mass of material to the Bishopsgate Institute in London.
