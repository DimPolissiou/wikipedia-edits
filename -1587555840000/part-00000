This guitar has crossed several African countries to arrive in my hands, I have been playing it ever since!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Knik|url=http://occii.org/knik/interview-mdou-moctar/|work=\"An Interview with Mdou Moctar|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMdou Moctar released his fifth studio album ''Ilana (The Creator)'' in 2019, it was his first studio album recorded with a full band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mdou-moctar-ilana-the-creator/|title=Mdou Moctar: Ilana (The Creator)|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> ''[[NPR]]''<nowiki/>'s Bob Boilen named the album \"perhaps the most fiery psych-rock of the 21st century\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/03/21/704818917/first-listen-mdou-moctar-ilana-the-creator|title=Mdou Moctar's 'Ilana' Is Perhaps The Most Fiery Psych-Rock Of The 21st Century|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> while ''[https://happymag.tv/ Happy Mag]'' placed it at no.13 on their list of \"The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s\", labelling it \"serious music for a serious cause.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/the-25-best-psychedelic-rock-albums-of-the-2010s/|title=The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> \n\n==Films==\nMoctar appeared in the short film ''I Sing the Desert Electric''.<ref>{{cite web|title=i sing the desert electric (download)|url=http://sahelsounds.com/2013/03/i-sing-the-desert-electric-download/|publisher=Sahel Sounds|accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe also has the starring role in the 2015 film ''Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai'', which translates as \"Rain the Color of Blue with a Little Red In It\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Mdou Moctar - Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai TEASER|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9su1UxtaI7I|accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mdou Moctar protagoniza un nuevo filme documental: \"Rain the Color of Red with a Little Blue In It\"|url=http://www.conceptoradio.net/2013/12/27/mdou-moctar-protagoniza-un-nuevo-filme-documental-rain-color-red-little-blue/|work=conceptaradio|accessdate=30 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001154/http://www.conceptoradio.net/2013/12/27/mdou-moctar-protagoniza-un-nuevo-filme-documental-rain-color-red-little-blue/|archive-date=31 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It tells the story of a musician from Agadez, who struggles with competing artists, a difficult home life, romantic problems and his own internal strife;

The club was formed in 1986, by the [[Greek Cypriot]] community and currently competes in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria]]. Bentleigh made nationwide headlines when it became the first club below the [[A-League]] to make the semi-final of the [[FFA Cup]] in [[2014 FFA Cup|2014]]. The Greens hit another milestone a year later when they claimed their first major trophy, the NPL Victoria title. In 2016, Bentleigh Greens became Victorian top-flight league premiers for the first time.\n\nBentleigh are one of six state league teams to have eliminated an A-League team in the FFA Cup, along with [[Heidelberg United FC]], [[Redlands United FC]], [[Green Gully SC]], [[Adelaide City FC]] and [[Blacktown City FC]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:LogoBentleighGreens.png|thumb|Former Bentleigh Greens logo]]\n\n===Formation and Early Years===\nIn 1986, a small group of former members of Cypriot Community's Soccer Club, Central City, met at 15\u201317 Heffernan Lane. This group determined to create a strong Greek Cypriot based team in Melbourne. There were two previous failed attempts, one in the mid-1950s and secondly Central City from 1977 to 1983 which ran under the control of the Cyprus Community of Melbourne and Victoria from 1977 to 1980.\n\nThe \"Founders\" at this initial meeting were Michael Christopher, Ray Georgiou, Andrew Nicolaou, Michael Iaonnou, Harry Theocharous, Phillip Philippou, Tony Antoniou and Harry Constantinou. After making a huge fund raising effort and gathering together 150 foundation members they were able to take over [[Diamond Valley United SC|Greensborough SC]] and move it to Victory Park in the City of Moorabbin. The name of the club was changed to Bentleigh Greens. The green colours were retained.\n\n===Rise to the Victorian Premier League===\nThe club competed in the First Division of the Provisional League in 1987 season. That year the club finished runners up to Chelsea on goal difference, achieving promotion to Victorian League Division 4. The club was promoted to Division 3 in 1989 after a second-place finish, after just two years in Division 4. Bentleigh amazingly were promoted to Division 2 in 1990, having just been promoted to Division 3 that year. Two more promotions followed in 1993 and 1995, taking the Greens from Division 2 to the [[Victorian Premier League]] for the first time in the club's history. The 1995 promotion was the fifth promotion for the club in nine years, marking a very impressive rise through the ranks of Victorian football for the recently established Bentleigh side.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/B/BentleighGreensDH.html</ref>\n\nBentleigh went into their first ever VPL campaign under the management of Harry Chalkitis, managing a fourth-place finish and qualifying for the finals series. The Greens met [[Green Gully SC]] in the elimination final, but went down 3\u20131. The following campaign was even stronger for Bentleigh, finishing runners-up in the regular season, finishing just two points behind winners [[Altona Magic]], but then lost 4\u20131 to Green Gully in the qualifying final and 2\u20131 to Bulleen Inter Kings in the semi-final to crash out. [[Mark Bresciano]] scored the winner for Bulleen Inter that day.\n\nBentleigh were relegated in 2005, going down to the Victorian State League Division 1 for the first time since 1995. The side finished bottom of the league, managing just 16 points in 26 games. The Greens narrowly avoided successive relegations, finishing 10th in a 12 team league with the bottom two going down. The side finished just three points above the relegated [[Northcote City FC]]. Bentleigh were promoted back to the top flight in 2009, finishing second with 41 points. The side would have missed out on promotion and finished third had [[St Albans Saints]] not been deducted nine points that season.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2009SD1T.html</ref> In their first season back in the top flight, the Greens finished in 10th place, one above relegation.\n\nBentleigh made the VPL grand final in 2013, finishing third in the regular season. On their way to the final, Bentleigh beat [[Melbourne Knights FC]] 4\u20132 and then [[Northcote City]] 2\u20131, but lost to Northcote City in the grand final 3\u20132 in extra time.\n\n===2014\u20132015: FFA Cup Run and First Major Title===\nThe club made nationwide headlines after making it to the semi-final of the inaugural [[FFA Cup]] in 2014. The Greens beat [[Blacktown City FC|Blacktown City]] 1\u20130 in the Round of 32, [[Sydney Olympic FC|Sydney Olympic]] 2\u20131 in the Round of 16, [[Adelaide City FC|Adelaide City]] 2\u20131 in the quarter finals before going down 3\u20130 to [[A-League]] side [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]]. The match against Adelaide City was played in front of almost 2,000 people at [[Kingston Heath Soccer Complex]],<ref>http://www.theffacup.com.au/article/result-bentleigh-greens-2-1-adelaide-city/16uwcbtbx89p41jwntf1hf4ol6</ref> while the match against Perth Glory drew a reported 3,300 people.<ref>http://www.theffacup.com.au/matchcentre/Bentleigh-Greens-v-Perth-Glory/786063</ref> Bentleigh brought in a number of high-profile players for the 2015 season, including the likes of [[Daniel Visevic]], Steven Topalovic and Queensland trio Troy Ruthven, Matt Thurtell and [[Chris Lucas]].

The club was formed in 1986, by the [[Greek Cypriot]] community and currently competes in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria]]. Bentleigh made nationwide headlines when it became the first club below the [[A-League]] to make the semi-final of the [[FFA Cup]] in [[2014 FFA Cup|2014]]. The Greens hit another milestone a year later when they claimed their first major trophy, the NPL Victoria title. In 2016, Bentleigh Greens became Victorian top-flight league premiers for the first time.\n\nBentleigh are one of six state league teams to have eliminated an A-League team in the FFA Cup, along with [[Heidelberg United FC]], [[Redlands United FC]], [[Green Gully SC]], [[Adelaide City FC]] and [[Blacktown City FC]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:LogoBentleighGreens.png|thumb|Former Bentleigh Greens logo]]\n\n===Formation and Early Years===\nIn 1986, a small group of former members of Cypriot Community's Soccer Club, Central City, met at 15\u201317 Heffernan Lane. This group determined to create a strong Greek Cypriot based team in Melbourne. There were two previous failed attempts, one in the mid-1950s and secondly Central City from 1977 to 1983 which ran under the control of the Cyprus Community of Melbourne and Victoria from 1977 to 1980.\n\nThe \"Founders\" at this initial meeting were Michael Christopher, Ray Georgiou, Andrew Nicolaou, Michael Iaonnou, Harry Theocharous, Phillip Philippou, Tony Antoniou and Harry Constantinou. After making a huge fund raising effort and gathering together 150 foundation members they were able to take over [[Diamond Valley United SC|Greensborough SC]] and move it to Victory Park in the City of Moorabbin. The name of the club was changed to Bentleigh Greens. The green colours were retained.\n\n===Rise to the Victorian Premier League===\nThe club competed in the First Division of the Provisional League in 1987 season. That year the club finished runners up to Chelsea on goal difference, achieving promotion to Victorian League Division 4. The club was promoted to Division 3 in 1989 after a second-place finish, after just two years in Division 4. Bentleigh amazingly were promoted to Division 2 in 1990, having just been promoted to Division 3 that year. Two more promotions followed in 1993 and 1995, taking the Greens from Division 2 to the [[Victorian Premier League]] for the first time in the club's history. The 1995 promotion was the fifth promotion for the club in nine years, marking a very impressive rise through the ranks of Victorian football for the recently established Bentleigh side.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/B/BentleighGreensDH.html</ref>\n\nBentleigh went into their first ever VPL campaign under the management of Harry Chalkitis, managing a fourth-place finish and qualifying for the finals series. The Greens met [[Green Gully SC]] in the elimination final, but went down 3\u20131. The following campaign was even stronger for Bentleigh, finishing runners-up in the regular season, finishing just two points behind winners [[Altona Magic]], but then lost 4\u20131 to Green Gully in the qualifying final and 2\u20131 to Bulleen Inter Kings in the semi-final to crash out. [[Mark Bresciano]] scored the winner for Bulleen Inter that day.\n\nBentleigh were relegated in 2005, going down to the Victorian State League Division 1 for the first time since 1995. The side finished bottom of the league, managing just 16 points in 26 games. The Greens narrowly avoided successive relegations, finishing 10th in a 12 team league with the bottom two going down. The side finished just three points above the relegated [[Northcote City FC]]. Bentleigh were promoted back to the top flight in 2009, finishing second with 41 points. The side would have missed out on promotion and finished third had [[St Albans Saints]] not been deducted nine points that season.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2009SD1T.html</ref> In their first season back in the top flight, the Greens finished in 10th place, one above relegation.\n\nBentleigh made the VPL grand final in 2013, finishing third in the regular season. On their way to the final, Bentleigh beat [[Melbourne Knights FC]] 4\u20132 and then [[Northcote City]] 2\u20131, but lost to Northcote City in the grand final 3\u20132 in extra time.\n\n===2014\u20132015: FFA Cup Run and First Major Title===\nThe club made nationwide headlines after making it to the semi-final of the inaugural [[FFA Cup]] in 2014.
