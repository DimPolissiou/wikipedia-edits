Tolkien's influences", "text_new": "{{short description|Sources of Tolkien's fiction}}\n{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\nWhile highly creative, the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] drew on a number of sources. Tolkien was inspired by the academic fields of [[philology]] and early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] literature. He was also influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. His fiction also reflected his Christian beliefs, his consumption of contemporary culture, and his personal experiences, including his reaction to twentieth\u2013century warfare.\n<!--need an overview here-->\n\n==Philology==\n\nTolkien was a professional [[philologist]], a scholar of comparative and historical [[linguistics]]. He was especially familiar with [[Old English]] and related languages. Tolkien stated in a letter to his American publisher [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 30 June 1955 that his earlier remark to the poet and ''[[The New York Times]]'' book reviewer [[Harvey Breit]] \"I am a philologist and all my work is philological.\" was meant to imply that his work was \"all of a piece, and ''fundamentally linguistic'' [sic] in inspiration. ... The [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|invention of languages]] is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows.\"<ref>''[[The Letters of J. R. R.

For example, ''Beowulf''{{'}}s list of creatures, ''eotenas ond ylfe ond [[orc]]n\u00e9as'', \"ettens [giants] and elves and demon-corpses\", contributed to his creation of some of the races of beings in Middle-earth, though with so little information about what elves were like, he was forced to combine scraps from all the Old English sources he could find.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=66-74}} He derived the ents from a phrase in another Old English poem, ''[[Maxims II]]'', ''or\u00feanc enta geweorc'', \"skilful work of ents\";{{sfn|Shippey|2005|p=149}} The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that Tolkien took the name of the tower of [[Orthanc]] (''or\u00feanc'') from the same phrase, reinterpreted as \"Orthanc, the ents' fortress\".{{sfn|Shippey|2001|p=88}} The word occurs again in ''Beowulf'' in the phrase ''searonet seowed, smi\u00fees or\u00feancum'', \"[a [[Chain mail|mail-shirt]], a] cunning-net sewn, by a smith's skill\": Tolkien used ''searo'' in its Mercian form ''*saru'' for the name of Orthanc's ruler, the wizard [[Saruman]], incorporating the ideas of cunning and technology into Saruman's character.{{sfn|Shippey|2001|pp=169-170}} He made use of ''Beowulf'', too, along with other Old English sources, for many aspects of the [[Riders of Rohan]]: for instance, their land was the Mark, a version of the Mercia where he lived, in Mercian dialect ''*Marc''; and his account in \"The King of the Golden Hall\" of the three successive challenges to strangers approaching [[Meduseld]] exactly parallels Beowulf's approach to a hall of the same name.{{sfn|Shippey|2001|pp=90-97}}\n\n[[File:Tolkien's Sigelwara Etymologies.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Tolkien's ''[[Sigelwara Land|Sigelwara]]'' etymologies, leading to three strands in his writings on [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Sigelwara Land\"/>{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=48-49}}]]\n\n===''Sigelwara''===\n{{further|Sigelwara Land}}\n\nSeveral Middle-earth concepts may have come from the Old English word ''Sigelwara'', used in the ''[[Codex Junius]]'' to mean \"Aethiopian\".<ref name=\"Exodus\">{{cite web |title=Junius 11 \"Exodus\" ll. 68-88 |url=http://mcllibrary.org/Junius/exodus.html |publisher=The Medieval & Classical Literature Library |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Shippey|2005|p=54}} Tolkien wondered why there was a word with this meaning, and conjectured that it had once had a different meaning, which he explored in his essay \"[[Sigelwara Land]]\".<ref name=\"Sigelwara Land\">[[J.

In both, the male heroes make rash promises after having been stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Finrod]]; both show rings that prove their identities; both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, [[Twrch Trwyth]] and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf [[Carcharoth]]) with the help of a supernatural hound (Cafall and [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]).

According to the 2011 census, the town of Glogovac had 6,143 inhabitants, while the municipality had 58,531 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography and population==\nGlogovac municipality is located in central Kosovo, between the [[\u010ci\u010davica]] mountains in the east and the [[Drenica]] hills in the north and west. The main road from [[Pristina]] to [[Pe\u0107]] crosses the municipality.\n\nAt a junction at [[Komorani]] village, a smaller road extends north from the highway, passing through Glogovac town and continuing to [[Skenderaj]]. There are a total of 36 villages in the municipality, including the town of Glogovac. The municipality's population prior to the 1999 bombing was approximately 58,579 made up almost entirely of Albanians, with a small number of Serbs and others only in the Glogovac town. No minorities remained in the municipality, thus Glogovac today reflects a [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] environment.\n\n== History ==\n [[File:HK NOHAB Di 3 008 at Drenas.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Train passing the \"Guri i Plakes\" in Dobro\u0161evac (Dritan)]]\nThe municipality of Glogovac was established before [[World War II]]. During Yugoslavia economic growth was low. Lately, there has been a gradual improvement in economic, agricultural, educational, medical and industrial growth. Municipal development has affected the construction of network-educational system, health and service network intensifying agricultural development has become especially after the construction of the irrigation system \"Iber Lepenci\", while a positive movement for the economy of Glogovac is marked by complex building \"Ferronikeli\".\n\nPrior and during the [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u201399), the ethnic Albanian separatist [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) had a strong level of influence and during the war controlled large areas of the municipality. Drenica, including the Glogovac municipality was consequently badly affected. During the war, there were [[Drenica massacres|instances of massacres]] carried out by Yugoslav forces. Mass graves were later exhumed in an attempt to conceal crimes.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Kosovo Chronology|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=PBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Serbs accused of clearing mass graves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/347350.stm|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=18 May 1999}}</ref>\n\n== Services, media and organizations ==\n\n=== Internet services ===\n\nThe strongest local Internet providing company at the area at the time is KUJTESA.Other companies like:Sky Net,Galaktika and others were established after the war at 2002 and are some of leading companies at the region.\n\n=== Local and international NGOs ===\n\nThe presence of the international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the municipality remains unchanged. The number of international NGOs is reduced, while their activity level can be described as modest. Only the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) continues to be based in Glogovac while the few other international NGOs working in Glogovac are mainly based in Pristina. These include Swiss CARITAS and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). The most prominent local NGOs are Mother Theresa Society (MTS), the \u2018Council for Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms\u2019, Shpresa, Aureola, Gresa, Nora, and Handikos. The KLA War Veterans Association, KLA Invalids Association, Friends of KPC, Pensioners Association, Glogovac Hearing Impaired Association, Union Fund of the Republic of Kosova (UFORK) or the so- called \"Bukoshi Fund\" are active in the municipality as well.\n\n=== Local media ===\n\nThere are no local newspapers, except two temporary magazines \"Realiteti\" (a youth magazine) and \"Spektri\" (local magazine). However, there are four correspondents residing in Glogovac working for major newspapers based in Pristina. There are two Radio Stations, \"[[92.1 Capital FM]]\" broadcasting on a regional coverage, and \"Radio Dodona\" of which at the moment is not operating for unknown reasons, and there is a local TV station \"Star TV\" broadcasting on cable only.\n\n== Police, civil protection, and military presence ==\nPolice in Glogovac is under the KPS management since July 2003. 15 UNMIK International police officers are mainly assisting and advising. The number of KPS is 99.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} They are all Kosovo Albanians. The Norwegian Kosovo Force (KFOR) contingent was taken over by the Finnish Battalion of KFOR in July 2003. The Finnish team enjoy the support of the community and has excellent co-operation with [[UNMIK]] Police, UN Civil Administration, [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and other members of international and local communities.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), a civilian defence unit and the successor of the KLA, numbers 60 members and is still dependent on the Regional Training Group (RTG) 1 Zone located in [[Skenderaj]].\n\n== Economy ==\nUNMIK, KFOR and NGOs are the main employers in the municipality, while the majority of the population is employed in family-owned, small sized, non-productive, private businesses like shops, car washes, and petrol stations. Most businesses have officially registered with UNMIK. Glogovac is an agricultural-based, rural municipality with wheat and maize as the primary crops. Before the conflict, a socially owned agricultural enterprise dominated the production but was destroyed. As a result, a large portion of the arable land is not cultivated as of today. The cattle farm in Krajkovo is now utilised as the temporary community shelter. The Ferronikel Factory provided jobs for more than 2,000 people at the peak of its production in 1988. Heavy damages were inflicted on the facility during the 1999 conflict, leaving it inoperable. Nevertheless, the recently privatised factory is still contributing to the infrastructure of Glogovac town with power, including water supply and an electric grid. A major development is the building of the Trade Centre in Glogovac town, which was completed by mid-2004. The municipality played a central role in the whole process by co-ordinating the financing, construction and management of the project. The Trade Centre contains 134 shops and offices for small businesses.{{citation needed|reason=speculation|date=December 2010}} Two quarries at Korrotic\u00eb e Ul\u00ebt and [[\u00c7ikatov\u00eb e Vjeter]] have become operational since the conflict.\n\nThere are four nickel mines operating at the territory of Glogovac: [[\u010cikatovo mine|\u010cikatovo]], [[Dushkaja mine|Dushkaja]], [[Gllavica mine|Gllavica]] and [[Suke mine|Suke]].\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nThe roads in the municipality range from good to poor. The main road has been redone. Local roads in the town and roads in the majority of villages remain a primary concern. During rainy or icy weather conditions it is difficult to reach some of the more remote villages due to the poor road conditions. All over the municipality there is a great lack of appropriate sewage systems in place, although in some areas the system was rehabilitated during 2001 and 2002. Telephone land lines are operational and the usage of mobile phones is the main form of communication. Electricity is available with daily power cuts, similar to the rest of the country. Latest developments include work done on the sewage network in Bushat and Drenasi II, construction of Court building and restoration of the Town Hall. Furthermore, the decision by EAR to discontinue the housing reconstruction program negatively impacted on the municipality where 1171 homes remain to be rebuilt.\n\n== Social services, health, and education ==\nAccording to the information from the Social Centre, there are 2,166 families receiving social assistance. A specialized team is dispatched to deal with traumatized people and domestic violence problems. A Health Center and six small Clinics serve the immediate need of population in Glogovac. A lack of sufficient amount of medicine and specialized equipment is notable. The outstanding issue of reimbursing the additional staff has been a major issue during 2003 and 2004. Despite the allocation of funds during the course of last year, no similar provisions have been made for 2004. In 2002 eight new buildings, including elementary schools and one pre-primary school were built, while in 2003 an additional primary school was constructed. In Glogovac municipality there are 21 primary schools, 2 secondary schools and 2 pre-primary school. The quality of teachers is less than desirable as many of them do not have the necessary qualifications. The overcrowding of schools presents one of the most persisting dilemmas for the municipality. The additional of \u201c9th\u201d class has further overburdened an existing malfunctioning system. There is a need for more kindergarten facilities, pre-primary and primary schools, and upgrading of the existing schools. Another persisting problem is the effective de-politicization of educational institutes, intensive training for the teachers and revision of the curriculum.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Jakup Krasniqi]] \u2013 Former Chairman of the Assembly of Kosovo\n* [[Izet Ibrahimi]] \u2013 Former Mayor of Drenas, Phd of Metallurgy\n* [[Rifat Kukaj]] \u2013 Notable Poet, Writer for Children\n* [[Iljaz Prokshi]] \u2013 Novelist\n\n== See also ==\n* [[District of Pristina]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = status\n| {{Kosovo-note}}\n}}\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Glogovac}}\n* {{Official website|http://kk.rks-gov.net/gllogoc}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071224124307/http://www.skynet-ks.com/ Skynet Internet Services]\n* [http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/1183_en.pdf.html OSCE municipal profile of Gllogovc / Glogovac]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070628141129/http://www.drenasi-iri.com/sh/index.htm Turkish and Albanian project]\n* [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/glogovac/- \"Ethnic Cleansing\" in the Glogovac Municipality]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326134730/http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_and_its_population.pdf SOK Kosovo and its population]\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Kosovo municipalities}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Cities in Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Glogovac]]\n[[Category:Drenica]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{other}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->| name = Glogovac\n| official_name = {{lang-sq|Gllogoc}}<br />{{lang-sr|\u0413\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446/Glogovac}}\n| other_name = <!-- images and maps  ----------->\n| settlement_type = [[List of cities in Kosovo|Town]] and [[Municipalities of Kosovo|municipality]]\n| image_skyline = \n| imagesize = 300px\n| image_caption = Panoramic view of Glogovac\n| image_flag = \n| flag_size = \n| image_seal = \n| seal_size = \n| image_shield = \n| shield_size = \n| image_blank_emblem = Stema e Komun\u00ebs Gllogoc.svg\n| blank_emblem_type = Emblem\n| blank_emblem_size = \n| image_map = File:Gllogoc - Glogova\u00e7.png\n| mapsize = \n| map_caption = Location of the municipality of Glogovac within Kosovo\n| pushpin_map = \n| pushpin_label_position = \n| pushpin_mapsize = \n| pushpin_map_caption = <!-- Location ------------------>\n| coordinates = {{coord|42|37|N|20|54|E|region:RS-KM|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type = Country\n| subdivision_name = [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}}\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Districts of Kosovo|District]]\n| subdivision_type2 = \n| subdivision_name1 = [[District of Pristina]]\n| subdivision_name2 = <!-- Politics ----------------->\n| established_title = \n| established_date = <!-- Area    --------------------->\n| government_footnotes = \n| government_type = \n| leader_party = \n| leader_title = Mayor\n| leader_name = Ramiz Lladrovci [[Democratic Party of Kosovo|PDK]]\n| unit_pref = Metric\n| area_footnotes = <!-- Population   ----------------------->\n| area_magnitude = \n| area_blank1_title = Urban\n| area_blank1_km2 = \n| area_blank2_title = Municipal\n| area_blank2_km2 = \n| elevation_footnotes = <!--for references: use  tags-->\n| elevation_m = \n| elevation_ft = <!-- Area/postal codes & others -------->\n| population_as_of = 2011\n| population_footnotes = \n| population_blank1_title = Urban\n| population_blank1 = 6143\n| population_density_blank1_km2 = auto\n| population_blank2_title = Municipal\n| population_blank2 = 58531\n| population_density_blank2_km2 = auto\n<!-- General information  --------------->| population_note = \n| postal_code_type = Postal code <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n| postal_code = 13000\n| area_code = +383 38\n| website = {{url|http://kk.rks-gov.net/gllogoc}}\n| footnotes = \n| timezone = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset = +1\n| timezone_DST = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST = +2\n| blank_name = [[Vehicle registration plates of Kosovo|Car plates]]\n| blank_info = 01\n| blank1_name = \n| blank1_info = \n}}\n'''Glogovac''' ({{lang-sr|\u0413\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446}}) or '''Gllogoc''' (in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]), is a [[List of cities in Kosovo|town]] and [[Municipalities of Kosovo|municipality]] located in the [[District of Pristina|Pristina District]] in central [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}}.

Despite the allocation of funds during the course of last year, no similar provisions have been made for 2004. In 2002 eight new buildings, including elementary schools and one pre-primary school were built, while in 2003 an additional primary school was constructed. In Glogovac municipality there are 21 primary schools, 2 secondary schools and 2 pre-primary school. The quality of teachers is less than desirable as many of them do not have the necessary qualifications. The overcrowding of schools presents one of the most persisting dilemmas for the municipality. The additional of \u201c9th\u201d class has further overburdened an existing malfunctioning system. There is a need for more kindergarten facilities, pre-primary and primary schools, and upgrading of the existing schools. Another persisting problem is the effective de-politicization of educational institutes, intensive training for the teachers and revision of the curriculum.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Jakup Krasniqi]] \u2013 Former Chairman of the Assembly of Kosovo\n* [[Izet Ibrahimi]] \u2013 Former Mayor of Drenas, Phd of Metallurgy\n* [[Rifat Kukaj]] \u2013 Notable Poet, Writer for Children\n* [[Iljaz Prokshi]] \u2013 Novelist\n\n== See also ==\n* [[District of Pristina]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = status\n| {{Kosovo-note}}\n}}\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Glogovac}}\n* {{Official website|http://kk.rks-gov.net/gllogoc}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071224124307/http://www.skynet-ks.com/ Skynet Internet Services]\n* [http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/1183_en.pdf.html OSCE municipal profile of Gllogovc / Glogovac]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070628141129/http://www.drenasi-iri.com/sh/index.htm Turkish and Albanian project]\n* [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/glogovac/- \"Ethnic Cleansing\" in the Glogovac Municipality]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326134730/http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_and_its_population.pdf SOK Kosovo and its population]\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Kosovo municipalities}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Cities in Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Glogovac]]\n[[Category:Drenica]]\n", "name_user": "Leartxd", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glogovac"}
