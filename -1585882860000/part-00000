To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat and declines Wyatt's \"anti-tourists\" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty. This forces Russ to turn informant against Ruth, who Roy intends to turn informant on Marty. Instead, Russ and his brother Boyd plan to rob and kill Marty to finance a life on the run.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation.

Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Helen tells Navarro Wendy and Marty are liabilities and Navarro tells her to do what she thinks best. Darlene persuades Nix to get Ben released in exchange for Nix's deputies not being included in Darlene's drug business. Ben goes to Helen's house, where he confronts Helen and Erin about Helen's illegal activities.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 29\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = Fire Pink\n |DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n |WrittenBy       = Miki Johnson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a taxi following his confrontation with Helen and Erin, Ben engages in an extended, incoherent monologue. Marty goes to Ruth's and asks why she worked for Ben's release. Ben arrives and admits he went to Helen's house. Ruth hides Ben at Darlene's. Erin confronts Charlotte and Jonah about Ben's claims and they admit Ben is right. Erin tells Helen she knows the truth about Helen's work and returns to Chicago. Recognizing they are vulnerable because Ben went to Helen's, Marty and Wendy plot to show Navarro they are more valuable to him than she is. Ben leaves Darlene's so he can pledge his love to Ruth. Nelson follows him into the casino, so Marty takes Ben out a side exit. Nelson follows Ruth home and Ruth challenges him about Cade's murder. Marty engineers a sudden increase in casino profits, meaning Maya will remain and continue auditing the Byrdes. Ben flees with Wendy, then calls police on himself, but Wendy talks officers out of arresting him. Ben calls Helen to apologize, and Wendy ends the call before Helen learns Ben's location. Wendy abandons Ben at a restaurant, then breaks down during a call to Marty. Ben sees Nelson arrive.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 30\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = All In\n |DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n |WrittenBy       = Chris Mundy\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = Nelson, Marty and Ruth cremate Ben's body at the funeral home.

Ruth and Wendy argue about blame for Ben's and Cade's deaths. Ruth quits working for Marty. Wendy admits she made the call revealing Ben's location. Marty consoles her by agreeing with her plan to make Navarro see their value. Wendy and Marty realize the way to win Navarro over is to end the cartel war. Marty provides still photos from Jonah's video of the attack on Cosgrove's truck to Maya, resulting in arrests of Lagunas members. Darlene avenges Ruth by shooting and wounding Frank Jr., then brings Frank Sr. into her business as a peace offering. Jonah confronts Helen at gunpoint about Ben's death, but Helen talks him out of shooting. Maya tells Marty Trevor gave Helen a copy of the confession Marty made to Maya. Navarro requires Wendy, Marty and Helen to attend his son's second baptism. Upon arrival, Nelson kills Helen and Navarro tells Marty and Wendy that this is the beginning of increased cooperation between the three of them.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#00AAC0;\"|\n| 1\n| 70% (69 reviews)\n| 66 (29 reviews)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#066069;\"|\n| 2\n| 76% (45 reviews)\n| 59 (14 reviews)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#01405F;\"|\n| 3\n| 96% (23 reviews)\n| 76 (10 reviews)\n|}\n\n====Season 1====\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season has an approval rating of 70% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 6.84/10.

The game is developed by [[Backbone Entertainment]] in conjunction with [[Harmonix]], published by [[MTV Games]] and distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].  The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.\n\nThe core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'', with the player responsible for playing all four instruments&mdash;[[lead guitar|lead]] and [[bass guitar]], [[drum]]s, and [[singing|vocals]]&mdash;using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to ''Rock Band'''s, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the ''Rock Band'' series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to ''Unplugged'' before they are released as [[downloadable content]] for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the [[PlayStation Store]].\n\n''Rock Band Unplugged'', in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a \"Limited Edition Entertainment Pack\" that also includes a ''Rock Band Unplugged''-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie ''[[School of Rock]]''.<ref name=\"pr announce\"/> A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of \"Rock Band Unplugged\" that is compatible with downloadable content <!-- as opposed to the 3 half-song demo in the PS Store --> is included with the [[PSP Go]].<ref name=\"pspgo-rbdemo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/27/psp-gos-rock-band-unplugged-demo-plays-dlc/|title=PSP Go's Rock Band Unplugged demo plays DLC |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:RBUnplugged screen.jpg|left|thumb|The player must repeatedly switch between four different instruments to complete a song.]]\n{{See also|Rock Band#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay features in ''Rock Band''}}\nThe main gameplay modes in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' are similar to that of the console versions of the game. In Tour mode, the player creates a customized band, plays sets of songs at venues around the world, earning cash and fame, and unlocking new vehicles, venues, and staff. Songs completed in Tour mode then become available in Quick Play mode, which allows any song to be played without the need to create a band.\n\nSongs in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' feature tracks for the same four instruments as in ''Rock Band'': lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. During the Quick Play and Tour modes, gameplay is similar to Harmonix' previous games ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'': The player presses combinations of buttons on the PSP to match notes in time with the rhythm of the currently-selected instrument. After completing a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] without missing any notes, the instrument continues to play automatically for a set amount of time, allowing the player to switch to another instrument using the shoulder buttons.<ref name=\"rbu announce\"/> Successfully completing multiple phrases in a row builds a score multiplier, as well as allowing the song to play in its entirety. Not completing a phrase in a track for an extended period of time will drain the Crowd Meter for that instrument, eventually causing the instrument to fail. A failed track will eventually cause the entire band to fail if not saved in time.\n\nOverdrive is handled similarly to the main ''Rock Band'' series. By hitting certain white-colored sections of notes placed throughout a song, the player fills the Energy Meter. Once the meter is at least half full, the player may press down on the D-pad or X to activate Overdrive, which revives all failed instruments and enables a temporary state that boosts the score multiplier and slows the degradation of the Crowd Meter for all instruments.  During solos, the player is automatically switched to the appropriate instrument; each note is scored individually, and the phrasing and track-switching elements do not apply until the solo is over.\n\nTwo additional modes, Band Survival Mode and Warmup Mode, are included in the \"Extras\" section of the game. In both modes, notes are scored individually, instead of being divided into phrases. Tracks will not play automatically, causing the Crowd Meter for unselected instruments to continually drop in Band Survival Mode. In Warmup Mode, only the currently-selected track is affected by missed notes.  No multiplayer mode is included in the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/04/partial-rock-band-unplugged-track-list-revealed.ars | title = Partial Rock Band Unplugged track list revealed | website = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 2009-04-01 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 | first = Andrew | last = Webster }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n''Rock Band Unplugged'' features 41 tracks, all of them [[master recording]]s. The game uses the PSP's Wi-Fi capabilities to provide additional downloadable content from music providers through the PlayStation Store.  Players can also download new tracks to the PSP through the PC version of the PlayStation Store.<ref name=\"pr announce\">{{cite web | url = http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-08-2009/0005002756&EDATE= | title = 'Rock Band Unplugged' for the PSP(R) (PlayStation(R)Portable) System: The Award-Winning Music Video Game is Going On the Road On June 9, 2009 | publisher = PR Newswire | date = 2009-04-08 | accessdate = 2009-04-08 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417202302/http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F04-08-2009%2F0005002756&EDATE= | archivedate = April 17, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/02/24/littlebigplanet-psp-announced-plus-tons-of-other-major-titles/ | title = 'LittleBigPlanet' PSP Announced, Plus Tons Of Other Major Titles | first = Stephan | last= Totilo | publisher = [[MTV]] | date=  2009-02-24 | accessdate = 2009-02-24}}</ref> Ten songs were made available for download on the day of the game's release,<ref name=\"gi preview\">{{cite news|title=Rock Band Unplugged|date=May 2009|work=[[Game Informer]]|pages=73}}</ref> and two new songs are released each week.

The ''Lite'' version includes the 5 Starter Pack songs, but can accept all downloadable content (DLC). The in-game Music Store enables users to download any of the original ''Rock Band Unplugged'' songs for the same price as the existing downloadable songs. Original ''Rock Band Unplugged'' songs can only be purchased through the in-game Music Store, while additional DLC songs can be purchased from either the PlayStation Store or the in-game Music Store.

The game's gameplay was praised, likening it to the success of Harmonix' previous games ''Frequency'' and ''Amplitude'',<ref name=\"gameinformer review\"/><ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> and called a \"unexpectedly nostalgic pleasure\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> It was further considered a general improvement on the standard ''Rock Band'' gameplay format, \"adding a new level of depth for veteran players\",<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> and that by being in control of all parts of the band, the player would be more connected to their virtual band than in the console versions.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> Reviewers praised the use of sound, particularly the slight volume emphasis given to the current instrument that is being played, though recommended the use of headphones to overcome the poor speaker quality of the PSP unit.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The choice of control scheme was also praised, which avoided introducing too many difficult button combinations on the PSP unit.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> The game's difficulty was also noted to be well-balanced both between songs and individual difficulty levels.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/>\n\nReviewers noted that the \"World Tour\" mode of the game suffered the same problems that both ''Rock Band'' games had when they were first released, in that without additional content, the player would be likely playing the same song several times over as they progress through the tour.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"gameinformer review\"/><ref name=\"1up review\"/> The lack of multiplayer or online leaderboards for ''Rock Band Unplugged'' was considered its largest weakness.<ref name=\"1up review\"/> [[IGN]]'s Greg Miller lamented that unlike the social nature of ''Rock Band'' on consoles, the lack of such interaction cooperative or competitively with a second player leaves little reason to come back to the game or purchase additional content.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Carolyn Petit, in considering the success of the multiplayer aspects of the other ''Rock Band'' titles, considered the omission \"baffling\".<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The cost of additional downloadable content, even in consideration of it being more of the same that already exists in the ''Rock Band'' series, remains the same, from $0.99 to $1.99 a song.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> Reviewers also criticized the need to repurchase such downloadable content for the game, with no way to reuse existing PlayStation 3 ''Rock Band'' content with the PSP game.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022324/http://www.rockband.com/games/unplugged ''Rock Band Unplugged'' website] \n\n{{Rock Band series}} \n{{Harmonix games}}\n\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Drumming video games]]\n[[Category:Guitar video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable-only games]]\n[[Category:Rock Band series]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2009 video game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title=Rock Band Unplugged\n|image=[[File:Rock band unplugged.jpg]]\n|caption=''Rock Band Unplugged'' cover art\n|developer=[[Harmonix]]<br/>[[Backbone Entertainment]]\n|publisher=[[MTV|MTV Games]]\n'''|designer=\n|engine=\n|series=''[[Rock Band]]''\n|released=June 9, 2009\n|genre=[[Rhythm game]]\n|modes=[[Single player]]\n|platforms=[[PlayStation Portable]]\n}}\n\n'''''Rock Band Unplugged''''' is an expansion of the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' series]] of [[music video game]]s released for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is developed by [[Backbone Entertainment]] in conjunction with [[Harmonix]], published by [[MTV Games]] and distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].  The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.\n\nThe core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'', with the player responsible for playing all four instruments&mdash;[[lead guitar|lead]] and [[bass guitar]], [[drum]]s, and [[singing|vocals]]&mdash;using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to ''Rock Band'''s, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the ''Rock Band'' series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to ''Unplugged'' before they are released as [[downloadable content]] for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the [[PlayStation Store]].\n\n''Rock Band Unplugged'', in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a \"Limited Edition Entertainment Pack\" that also includes a ''Rock Band Unplugged''-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie ''[[School of Rock]]''.<ref name=\"pr announce\"/> A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of \"Rock Band Unplugged\" that is compatible with downloadable content <!-- as opposed to the 3 half-song demo in the PS Store --> is included with the [[PSP Go]].<ref name=\"pspgo-rbdemo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/27/psp-gos-rock-band-unplugged-demo-plays-dlc/|title=PSP Go's Rock Band Unplugged demo plays DLC |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:RBUnplugged screen.jpg|left|thumb|The player must repeatedly switch between four different instruments to complete a song.]]\n{{See also|Rock Band#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay features in ''Rock Band''}}\nThe main gameplay modes in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' are similar to that of the console versions of the game. In Tour mode, the player creates a customized band, plays sets of songs at venues around the world, earning cash and fame, and unlocking new vehicles, venues, and staff. Songs completed in Tour mode then become available in Quick Play mode, which allows any song to be played without the need to create a band.\n\nSongs in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' feature tracks for the same four instruments as in ''Rock Band'': lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. During the Quick Play and Tour modes, gameplay is similar to Harmonix' previous games ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'': The player presses combinations of buttons on the PSP to match notes in time with the rhythm of the currently-selected instrument. After completing a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] without missing any notes, the instrument continues to play automatically for a set amount of time, allowing the player to switch to another instrument using the shoulder buttons.<ref name=\"rbu announce\"/> Successfully completing multiple phrases in a row builds a score multiplier, as well as allowing the song to play in its entirety. Not completing a phrase in a track for an extended period of time will drain the Crowd Meter for that instrument, eventually causing the instrument to fail. A failed track will eventually cause the entire band to fail if not saved in time.\n\nOverdrive is handled similarly to the main ''Rock Band'' series. By hitting certain white-colored sections of notes placed throughout a song, the player fills the Energy Meter. Once the meter is at least half full, the player may press down on the D-pad or X to activate Overdrive, which revives all failed instruments and enables a temporary state that boosts the score multiplier and slows the degradation of the Crowd Meter for all instruments.  During solos, the player is automatically switched to the appropriate instrument; each note is scored individually, and the phrasing and track-switching elements do not apply until the solo is over.\n\nTwo additional modes, Band Survival Mode and Warmup Mode, are included in the \"Extras\" section of the game. In both modes, notes are scored individually, instead of being divided into phrases. Tracks will not play automatically, causing the Crowd Meter for unselected instruments to continually drop in Band Survival Mode. In Warmup Mode, only the currently-selected track is affected by missed notes.  No multiplayer mode is included in the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/04/partial-rock-band-unplugged-track-list-revealed.ars | title = Partial Rock Band Unplugged track list revealed | website = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 2009-04-01 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 | first = Andrew | last = Webster }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n''Rock Band Unplugged'' features 41 tracks, all of them [[master recording]]s. The game uses the PSP's Wi-Fi capabilities to provide additional downloadable content from music providers through the PlayStation Store.

The bird was only reported trterttrtrttrby French sailor [[545435 rt435]], who 45was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]].

It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Rodrigues Starling.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical restoration, based on Tafforet's account, subfossils, and related species]]\nThe Rodrigues starling was large for a starling, being {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=on|0}} in length.

These birds are a little larger than a blackbird [R\u00e9union bulbul (''[[Hypsipetes borbonicus]]'')], and have white plumage, part of the wings and tail black, the beak yellow as well as the feet, and make a wonderful warbling.

He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Necropsar rodericanus skull.png|thumb|upright|left|Skull and [[temporomandibular joint]]]]\nHume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of [[\u00cele Gombrani]], which was then called au M\u00e2t. [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]], a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Hume\n| first1 = J.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings.

He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Necropsar rodericanus skull.png|thumb|upright|left|Skull and [[temporomandibular joint]]]]\nHume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.
