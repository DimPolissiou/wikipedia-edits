The airline ceased operations after only a few months after it failed to secure an [[air operator's certificate]].\n\nAfter it received backing from South Korean investors, the company restarted operations in 2016 under its present name and with the goal of connecting the South Korean market with tourist destinations [[Boracay]] and [[Cebu]] in the Philippines. On April 27, 2017, the inaugural flight between [[Kalibo]] and [[Seoul]] commenced using an [[Airbus A320-232]]. \n\nIn 2019, the airline ranked fourth among Philippine carriers in terms of the number of international passengers.

{"title_page": "List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons (VF)", "text_new": "The VF designation was one of the oldest in use by the U.S. Navy. From 1921 to 1948 it designated \"Fighting Plane Squadron\" or \"Fighting Squadron\". It designated \"Fighter Squadron\" from 1948 until 2006 when the last VF squadron was redesignated to Strike Fighter (VFA) squadron.<ref name=\"auto\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I App 4</ref> The designation has not been used since 2006. During the time the VF designation was in use there were two periods during which a suffix letter was added after the squadron designation number. From 1927 to 1937 the suffix letter denoted to which fleet the squadron belonged; B for Battle Fleet and S for Scouting Fleet. From 15 November 1946 to as late as 1 September 1948 the suffix letter denoted to which type of Carrier Air Group the squadron belonged: A for those assigned to [[USS Essex (CV-9)|''Essex'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Attack\" carriers), B for those assigned to the large [[USS Midway (CV-41)|''Midway'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Battle\" carriers), L for those assigned to \"light\" [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|''Independence'']] or [[USS Saipan (CVL-48)|''Siapan'']] class carriers and E for those assigned to remaining small WWII [[Escort carrier|\"escort carriers\"]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I Chap 1</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1937, VF squadron designation numbers were determined by the hull number of the aircraft carrier (CV) from which they operated. VF-3 for example belonged to the Saratoga's Air Group as USS Saratoga was CV 3. When the ship named Air Groups were given designation numbers themselves, their designation numbers matched the CV hull numbers, the Saratoga Air Group became Carrier Air Group Three (CVG-3) and CVG-3's VF squadron was VF-3. With the massive buildup of WWII the CVG numbers became divorced from CV hull numbers, but the CVG's squadrons were still numbered with the CVG to which they were assigned so, VF-6 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-6 and VF-81 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-81. Before and during WWII each ship named Air Group and CVG had only one VF squadron assigned so numbering the VF squadron with the ship hull number or CVG designation number worked well. There were a few exceptions and in those cases either a second digit was added (VF-41 and VF-42) or a letter was added (VF-74A and VF-74B), but those instances were rare. After the war the CVG and squadron designation system was changed. CVGs were redesignated CVAG, CVBG, CVLG and CVEG according to the type of aircraft carrier to which they were assigned and they were all designated with odd numbers. Each had two VF squadrons assigned which were designated VF-1A and VF-2A for CVAG-1, VF-3A and VF-4A for CVAG-3, VF-1B and VF-2B for CVBG-1 etc... On 1 Sep 1948 the designation system changed again dropping the \"A\", \"B\", \"L\" and \"E\" from both the CVG designations and from the squadron designations. CVGs were numbered sequentially beginning with CVG-1 and each had three VF squadrons assigned which were numbered sequentially by using the CVG number followed by a single digit, so CVG-1's VF squadrons were designated VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 and CVG-11's VF squadrons were designated VF-111, VF-112 and VF-113 etc... Beginning in 1949 most CVGs received a fourth VF squadron (VF-14, VF-24, VF-114 etc...). These varied designation systems used through the years resulted in squadron designations being reused for completely unrelated squadrons; take the designations VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 for example. The first use of each of those designations was used to designate the single VF squadron of each of three different CVGs during WWII, CVG-11, CVG-12 and CVG-13. The second use of those designations designated three VF squadrons of CVG-1 after 1 September 1948.\n\nThroughout this entire period, from pre-WWII to 1965, as squadrons were reassigned from one CVG to another they were redesignated to conform with the numbering system of that CVG. That practice began to be abandoned by the mid 1950s but did not completely cease until 1965. By then, all squadron designation numbers had been \"frozen\" and were divorced from the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) designation numbers. Later, newly established squadrons were numbered either sequentially (such as VF-1 and VF-2 established in 1972) or were given designation numbers to commemorate a long-serving disestablished squadron (VF-191 established in 1986 commemorated a squadron which had existed from 1943 to 1978). This is why today there are squadrons with numbers as low as VFA-2 and as high as VFA-213 with many numbers missing in between.\n\nThe table below does not list disestablished squadrons, it is a list of squadron designations which are no longer in use. In most cases a single squadron carried multiple designations between the time it was established and the time it was disestablished, therefore multiple designations in the table belonged to a single squadron. Most of the squadron designations in the table belonged to squadrons which have been disestablished, but also included are former designations of some VFA squadrons which are still active, and one which has been deactivated. This table includes all \"VF\" designations that have been used by US Navy aircraft squadrons except for those assigned to USNR squadrons which existed before 1970 unless they were activated, in which case they are included. It also does not include 25 \"VF(N)\" designations (night fighter) which were used between 1943 and 1946.<ref name=\"history.navy.mil\">https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/insignias/naval-aviation-squadron-lineage/fighter-squadron-lineage.html</ref> Sorting the table by the \"Disestablished as (or current designation)\" column will display all designations belonging to a single squadron grouped together, note that many squadrons were designated as both VF and VA squadrons at different times during their existence.\n\nNote: The parenthetical (first use), (second use), (1st), (2nd), (3rd) etc... appended to some designations in the table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n! Designation !! Insignia !! Nickname !!

1948. Squadron suffix letters were dropped and CVAGs and CVBGs were all redesignated CVGs. New squadron designation numbers denoted to which CVG the squadron was assigned with the first one or two digits denoting the CVG followed by a 1, 2 or 3 to differentiate between the VF squadrons (CVG-1: VF-11, VF-12, VF-13; CVG-2: VF-21, VF-22, VF-23; CVG-11: VF-111, VF-112, VF-113; CVG-15: VF-151, VF-152, VF-153 etc...). A fourth VF squadron (VF-__4) was added to most CVGs beginning in 1949. When a squadron was moved from one CVG to another it was redesignated to conform with the designation of the newly assigned CVG. That practice had begun to be abandoned by the mid 1950s when squadrons which were transferred from one CVG to another were redesignated in some cases but not in others. By 1965 the practice of redesignataing squadrons in accordance with Carrier Air Wing (CVGs were retitled Carrier Air Wings (CVW) on 20 December 1963) assignment had ceased completely and squadron designations were \"frozen\" and divorced from Carrier Air Wing designations. Squadrons and CVGs are grouped by designation below for ease of reading the table but it should not be assumed that the listed squadrons were assigned only to the CVG in which section they appear in the table.\n|-\n|[[VF-1 (1945-8)|VF-1<br/>(1945-8)]]<br/>(fourth use)\n|\n|Firebirds\n|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F]]\n|VF-41(2nd): 26 Mar 1945-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1E: 15 Nov 1946-1 Sep 1948<br/>'''VF-1(4th): 1 Sep 1948-20 Nov 1948'''\n|VF-1 (4th)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|20 November 1948\n|When CVEG-1 was disestablished on 1 Sep 1948 its VF squadron was redesignated VF-1(4th) until it was disestablished less than three months later\n|-\n!colspan=8|[[Carrier Air Wing One|''CVG-1'' (2nd)]]: CVAG-1 redesignated ''CVG-1'' (2nd) 1 Sep 1948, currently exists as CVW-1\n|-\n|[[VF-11|VF-11<br/>(1948-59)]]<br>(second use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]\n|Red Rippers\n|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat|F8F]]<br/>[[McDonnell F2H Banshee|F2H]]\n|VF-5(1st): 1 Feb 1927-1 Jul 1927<br/>VF-5S(1st): 1 Jul 1927-Jan 1928<br/>VF-5B(1st): Jan 1928-1 Jul 1928<br/>''[[U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Aircraft Squadron Designations|VB]]-1B'': 1 Jul 1928-1 Jul 1930<br/>VF-5B(2nd): 1 Jul 1930-Jul 1932<br/>VF-5S(2nd): Jul 1932-Apr 1933<br/>VF-5B(3rd): Apr 1933-1 Jul 1937<br/>VF-4(2nd): 1 Jul 1937-15 Mar 1941<br/>VF-41(1st): 15 Mar 1941-4 Aug 1943<br/>VF-4(4th): 4 Aug 1943-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1A: 15 Nov 1946-2 Aug 1948<br/>'''VF-11(2nd): 2 Aug 1948-15 Feb 1959'''\n|VF-11 (2nd)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|15 February 1959\n|Original \"Red Rippers\" squadron.<br/>Redesignated as one of '''CVG-1'''(2nd)'s initial squadrons\n|-\n|[[VFA-11|VF-11<br/>(1959-2005)]]<br>(third use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]<br/>(Adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|Red Rippers<br/>(adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|[[Vought F-8 Crusader|F8U/F-8]]<br/>[[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]<br/>[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]\n|VF-43(4th): 1 Sep 1950-16 Feb 1959<br/>'''VF-11(3rd): 16 Feb 1959-5 Nov 2005'''<br/>''VFA-11'': 5 Nov 2005\u2013present\n|VFA-11\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|Not applicable, still exists\n|Was redesignated VF-11(3rd) the day after VF-11(2nd) was disestablished to replace VF-11(2nd) in '''CVG-1'''(2nd).

From 1921 to 1948 it designated \"Fighting Plane Squadron\" or \"Fighting Squadron\". It designated \"Fighter Squadron\" from 1948 until 2006 when the last VF squadron was redesignated to Strike Fighter (VFA) squadron.<ref name=\"auto\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I App 4</ref> The designation has not been used since 2006. During the time the VF designation was in use there were two periods during which a suffix letter was added after the squadron designation number. From 1927 to 1937 the suffix letter denoted to which fleet the squadron belonged; B for Battle Fleet and S for Scouting Fleet. From 15 November 1946 to as late as 1 September 1948 the suffix letter denoted to which type of Carrier Air Group the squadron belonged: A for those assigned to [[USS Essex (CV-9)|''Essex'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Attack\" carriers), B for those assigned to the large [[USS Midway (CV-41)|''Midway'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Battle\" carriers), L for those assigned to \"light\" [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|''Independence'']] or [[USS Saipan (CVL-48)|''Siapan'']] class carriers and E for those assigned to remaining small WWII [[Escort carrier|\"escort carriers\"]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I Chap 1</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1937, VF squadron designation numbers were determined by the hull number of the aircraft carrier (CV) from which they operated. VF-3 for example belonged to the Saratoga's Air Group as USS Saratoga was CV 3. When the ship named Air Groups were given designation numbers themselves, their designation numbers matched the CV hull numbers, the Saratoga Air Group became Carrier Air Group Three (CVG-3) and CVG-3's VF squadron was VF-3. With the massive buildup of WWII the CVG numbers became divorced from CV hull numbers, but the CVG's squadrons were still numbered with the CVG to which they were assigned so, VF-6 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-6 and VF-81 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-81. Before and during WWII each ship named Air Group and CVG had only one VF squadron assigned so numbering the VF squadron with the ship hull number or CVG designation number worked well. There were a few exceptions and in those cases either a second digit was added (VF-41 and VF-42) or a letter was added (VF-74A and VF-74B), but those instances were rare. After the war the CVG and squadron designation system was changed. CVGs were redesignated CVAG, CVBG, CVLG and CVEG according to the type of aircraft carrier to which they were assigned and they were all designated with odd numbers. Each had two VF squadrons assigned which were designated VF-1A and VF-2A for CVAG-1, VF-3A and VF-4A for CVAG-3, VF-1B and VF-2B for CVBG-1 etc... On 1 Sep 1948 the designation system changed again dropping the \"A\", \"B\", \"L\" and \"E\" from both the CVG designations and from the squadron designations. CVGs were numbered sequentially beginning with CVG-1 and each had three VF squadrons assigned which were numbered sequentially by using the CVG number followed by a single digit, so CVG-1's VF squadrons were designated VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 and CVG-11's VF squadrons were designated VF-111, VF-112 and VF-113 etc... Beginning in 1949 most CVGs received a fourth VF squadron (VF-14, VF-24, VF-114 etc...). These varied designation systems used through the years resulted in squadron designations being reused for completely unrelated squadrons; take the designations VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 for example. The first use of each of those designations was used to designate the single VF squadron of each of three different CVGs during WWII, CVG-11, CVG-12 and CVG-13. The second use of those designations designated three VF squadrons of CVG-1 after 1 September 1948.\n\nThroughout this entire period, from pre-WWII to 1965, as squadrons were reassigned from one CVG to another they were redesignated to conform with the numbering system of that CVG. That practice began to be abandoned by the mid 1950s but did not completely cease until 1965. By then, all squadron designation numbers had been \"frozen\" and were divorced from the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) designation numbers. Later, newly established squadrons were numbered either sequentially (such as VF-1 and VF-2 established in 1972) or were given designation numbers to commemorate a long-serving disestablished squadron (VF-191 established in 1986 commemorated a squadron which had existed from 1943 to 1978). This is why today there are squadrons with numbers as low as VFA-2 and as high as VFA-213 with many numbers missing in between.\n\nThe table below does not list disestablished squadrons, it is a list of squadron designations which are no longer in use. In most cases a single squadron carried multiple designations between the time it was established and the time it was disestablished, therefore multiple designations in the table belonged to a single squadron. Most of the squadron designations in the table belonged to squadrons which have been disestablished, but also included are former designations of some VFA squadrons which are still active, and one which has been deactivated. This table includes all \"VF\" designations that have been used by US Navy aircraft squadrons except for those assigned to USNR squadrons which existed before 1970 unless they were activated, in which case they are included. It also does not include 25 \"VF(N)\" designations (night fighter) which were used between 1943 and 1946.<ref name=\"history.navy.mil\">https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/insignias/naval-aviation-squadron-lineage/fighter-squadron-lineage.html</ref> Sorting the table by the \"Disestablished as (or current designation)\" column will display all designations belonging to a single squadron grouped together, note that many squadrons were designated as both VF and VA squadrons at different times during their existence.\n\nNote: The parenthetical (first use), (second use), (1st), (2nd), (3rd) etc... appended to some designations in the table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n! Designation !! Insignia !! Nickname !!

1948. Squadron suffix letters were dropped and CVAGs and CVBGs were all redesignated CVGs. New squadron designation numbers denoted to which CVG the squadron was assigned with the first one or two digits denoting the CVG followed by a 1, 2 or 3 to differentiate between the VF squadrons (CVG-1: VF-11, VF-12, VF-13; CVG-2: VF-21, VF-22, VF-23; CVG-11: VF-111, VF-112, VF-113; CVG-15: VF-151, VF-152, VF-153 etc...). A fourth VF squadron (VF-__4) was added to most CVGs beginning in 1949. When a squadron was moved from one CVG to another it was redesignated to conform with the designation of the newly assigned CVG. That practice had begun to be abandoned by the mid 1950s when squadrons which were transferred from one CVG to another were redesignated in some cases but not in others. By 1965 the practice of redesignataing squadrons in accordance with Carrier Air Wing (CVGs were retitled Carrier Air Wings (CVW) on 20 December 1963) assignment had ceased completely and squadron designations were \"frozen\" and divorced from Carrier Air Wing designations. Squadrons and CVGs are grouped by designation below for ease of reading the table but it should not be assumed that the listed squadrons were assigned only to the CVG in which section they appear in the table.\n|-\n|[[VF-1 (1945-8)|VF-1<br/>(1945-8)]]<br/>(fourth use)\n|\n|Firebirds\n|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F]]\n|VF-41(2nd): 26 Mar 1945-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1E: 15 Nov 1946-1 Sep 1948<br/>'''VF-1(4th): 1 Sep 1948-20 Nov 1948'''\n|VF-1 (4th)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|20 November 1948\n|When CVEG-1 was disestablished on 1 Sep 1948 its VF squadron was redesignated VF-1(4th) until it was disestablished less than three months later\n|-\n!colspan=8|[[Carrier Air Wing One|''CVG-1'' (2nd)]]: CVAG-1 redesignated ''CVG-1'' (2nd) 1 Sep 1948, currently exists as CVW-1\n|-\n|[[VF-11|VF-11<br/>(1948-59)]]<br>(second use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]\n|Red Rippers\n|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat|F8F]]<br/>[[McDonnell F2H Banshee|F2H]]\n|VF-5(1st): 1 Feb 1927-1 Jul 1927<br/>VF-5S(1st): 1 Jul 1927-Jan 1928<br/>VF-5B(1st): Jan 1928-1 Jul 1928<br/>''[[U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Aircraft Squadron Designations|VB]]-1B'': 1 Jul 1928-1 Jul 1930<br/>VF-5B(2nd): 1 Jul 1930-Jul 1932<br/>VF-5S(2nd): Jul 1932-Apr 1933<br/>VF-5B(3rd): Apr 1933-1 Jul 1937<br/>VF-4(2nd): 1 Jul 1937-15 Mar 1941<br/>VF-41(1st): 15 Mar 1941-4 Aug 1943<br/>VF-4(4th): 4 Aug 1943-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1A: 15 Nov 1946-2 Aug 1948<br/>'''VF-11(2nd): 2 Aug 1948-15 Feb 1959'''\n|VF-11 (2nd)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|15 February 1959\n|Original \"Red Rippers\" squadron.<br/>Redesignated as one of '''CVG-1'''(2nd)'s initial squadrons\n|-\n|[[VFA-11|VF-11<br/>(1959-2005)]]<br>(third use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]<br/>(Adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|Red Rippers<br/>(adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|[[Vought F-8 Crusader|F8U/F-8]]<br/>[[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]<br/>[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]\n|VF-43(4th): 1 Sep 1950-16 Feb 1959<br/>'''VF-11(3rd): 16 Feb 1959-5 Nov 2005'''<br/>''VFA-11'': 5 Nov 2005\u2013present\n|VFA-11\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|Not applicable, still exists\n|Was redesignated VF-11(3rd) the day after VF-11(2nd) was disestablished to replace VF-11(2nd) in '''CVG-1'''(2nd).

I-176, known locally as the '''Morgantown Expressway''', travels from [[Morgantown, Pennsylvania|Morgantown]] to [[Cumru Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Cumru Township]] in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]], a suburban township just outside [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]; the entire length of the highway is just over {{convert|11|mi|km}}. The highway was originally known as I-180 or the \"Reading Spur\" when the Pennsylvania Turnpike was part of I-80S, but was redesignated to its present-day number in 1964 when I-80S became I-76.<ref>Ask the Rambler - [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/i76.htm Was I-76 Numbered to Honor Philadelphia for Independence Day, 1776?]</ref>\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:Interstate 176 northern terminus.JPG|left|thumb|I-176 northern terminus at US 422 in Cumru Township]]\nI-176 begins at the [[Morgantown, Pennsylvania|Morgantown]] interchange with [[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]] ([[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]) near the community of Morgantown in [[Caernarvon Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Caernarvon Township]], [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]]. The highway heads north from the [[trumpet interchange]] through the toll plaza and continues north as a four-lane [[freeway]] called the Morgantown Expressway, coming to an interchange with [[Pennsylvania Route 10|PA 10]] that provides access to Morgantown to the south. At this interchange, the freeway turns to the west, with a southbound [[runaway truck ramp]] just past the southbound exit ramp for PA 10. I-176 heads into the borough of [[New Morgan, Pennsylvania|New Morgan]] and runs through forested areas. The road comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with SR 2089, a four-lane freeway that heads south to an intersection with PA 10/[[Pennsylvania Route 23|PA 23]] in Morgantown. This used to be I-176's old alignment before it was realigned between that point and its current terminus at the Turnpike. At this point, the freeway curves to the northwest and forms the border between Caernarvon Township to the west and New Morgan to the east, passing through wooded surroundings as it heads to the west of a landfill. The route turns north and becomes the border between [[Robeson Township, Pennsylvania|Robeson Township]] to the west and New Morgan to the east before fully entering Robeson Township as it continues through forests. I-176 runs through wooded areas with some farm fields, passing over [[Allegheny Creek]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 568|PA 568]] before it comes to a northbound exit and entrance with the parallel PA 10 to the east in [[Green Hills, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Green Hills]]. From here, the freeway continues through woodland with nearby development and passes over PA 10 prior to entering [[Cumru Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Cumru Township]] and coming to a southbound exit and entrance connecting to PA 10 to the west. The road heads north-northeast through forested hills, curving to the north. The route reaches a [[diamond interchange]] with [[Pennsylvania Route 724|PA 724]] and passes over [[Norfolk Southern]]'s [[Harrisburg Line]] #1 and the [[Schuylkill River Trail]] as it heads west of industrial areas. I-176 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with the [[U.S. Route 422|US 422]] freeway southeast of the city of [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]].<ref name=google>{{Google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/40.1609899,-75.8823834/40.3045412,-75.8991246/@40.2299375,-75.9632723,19294m/data=!3m1!1e3|title=overview of Interstate 176|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=PennDOTBerks>{{cite map|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]]|title=Berks County, Pennsylvania Highway Map|url=http://www.dot7.state.pa.us/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/GHS/Roadnames/Berks_GHSN.PDF|year=2016|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{infobox road small\n|header_type=former\n|state=PA\n|type=I 1957\n|route=180\n|location=Morgantown - Reading\n|history=Original number for I-176 when I-76 was I-80S.\n}}\n[[File:Interstate 176 first northbound shield.JPG|right|thumb|I-176 first northbound shield in Caernarvon Township]]\n\nPrior to 1996, motorists wanting to get to I-176 from the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] (I-76) had to travel through Morgantown on [[Pennsylvania Route 10]]  and then enter I-176 northbound to Reading at a traffic light, similar to that found on [[Interstate 70 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 70]] in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania|Breezewood]].

The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In [[Flanders]], in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known to us today as a \u201cmusic box\u201d developed from musical [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff box]]es of the 18th century and were originally called ''carillons \u00e0 musique'' (French for \"chimes of music\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny [[drum]] and/or [[bell]]s in addition to the metal comb.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8543.jpg|thumb|Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders]]\nThe original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat pocket. The music boxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by [[clockwork]] and originally produced by artisan [[watchmaker]]s. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.\n\nThe cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours.\n\n[[File:CIMA mg 8302.jpg|thumb|Music box using the metal disk system]]\nThe very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the [[Polyphon]] and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8498.jpg|thumb|Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played.]]\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8461.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestrion]]]]\nThe term \"music box\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \"programming\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified [[wind instrument]] or plucked the chords on a modified [[string instrument]]. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the [[Orchestrion]].\n\nThere were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century.\n\nThe [https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771 Symphonium] company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771|title=Hose, K. (2009) A Brief History of the Symphonion Company in Museums Victoria Collections|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Two of the founders of the company, Gustave Brachhausen and Paul Riessner, left to set up a new firm, [[Polyphon]], in direct competition with their original business and their third partner, Oscar Paul Lochmann. <ref name=\":0\" />  Following the establishment of the Original Musikwerke Paul Lochmann in 1900, the founding Symphonion business continued until 1909. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to the Victoria Museums in Australia, \u201cThe Symphonion is notable for the enormous diversity of types, styles and models produced... No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties.  \u00a0 The company also pioneered the use of electric motors...the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos and phonographs.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile,  Polyphon expanded to America. where Brachhausen established the [[Regina Company|Regina Company.]] Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. \n\nIn the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \"juke-box\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in [[Long Beach, Washington]] (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The [[Musical Museum, Brentford]], [[London]] has a number of machines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |title=musicalmuseum.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035303/http://musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |archive-date=2011-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits.

Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down.\n\nCollectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \"Evolving Box Production\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that  add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs.\n\nMany kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers. A wide range of recordings and videos of historic music boxes is available on the web.\n\n===Timeline===\n{{prose|date=August 2012}}\n9th century: In Baghdad, Iraq, the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers, a trio of [[Inventions in the Islamic world|Persian inventors]], produced \"the earliest known mechanical musical instrument\", in this case a [[hydropower]]ed [[Organ (music)|organ]] which played interchangeable cylinders automatically, which they described in their ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]''.

In 1848, the manufacturing of the ''singing birds'' is improved by Blaise Bontems in his [[Paris]]ian workshop, to the point where it has remained unchanged to this day. Barrel organs become more popular.\n\n1796: [[Antoine Favre-Salomon]], a clockmaker from [[Geneva]] replaces the stack of bells by a comb with multiple pre-tuned metallic notes in order to reduce space. Together with a horizontally placed pinned barrel, this produces more varied and complex sounds. One of these first music boxes is now displayed at the [[Shanghai Gallery of Antique Music Boxes and Automata]] in [[Pudong]]'s [[Oriental Art Center]].<ref>[http://en.shoac.com.cn/Content.asp?nrID=141 en.shoac.com.cn], \"Antique Music Box Gallery\", accessed 18 Dec 2014.</ref> Numerous musical objects are produced in greater quantities in Geneva by several makers.\n\n1800: Isaac Daniel Piguet in Geneva produces repeating musical watches with a pinned horizontal disc operating radially arranged tuned steel teeth.\n\n1811: The first music boxes are produced in [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]]; an industry which surpasses the watchmaking and lace industries, and rapidly brings renown to the town. At this time, the musical-box industry represents 10% of Switzerland's export.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8521.jpg|thumb|Pocket watch with musical movements]]\n1865: Charles Reuge, a watchmaker from the [[Val-de-Travers]], settles in Sainte-Croix. He is one of many artisans making pocket watches with musical movements of the traditional calibre.\n\n1870: A German inventor creates a music box with discs, therefore allowing an easier and more frequent change of tunes. It is also the golden years of [[Automaton|automata]]. Already known in [[Egypt]], they will be improved to become real works of art.\n\n1877: [[Thomas Edison]] invents the [[phonograph]], which has important consequences for the musical-box industry, especially around the end of the century.\n\n1892: Gustave Brachhausen, who had been involved with the manufacturer of [[Polyphon]] disk music boxes in Germany, sails for America to establish the Regina Music Box Company in New Jersey. Regina, whose boxes are renowned among collectors for their tone, becomes a success and some 100,000 are sold before sales cease in 1921.\n\nEarly 20th century: The invention of the phonograph, the [[First World War]] and the economic crisis in the '20s bring down Sainte-Croix's main industry and make the luxury music box completely disappear.\n\n[[File:Caja musica.jpg|thumb|Music box with dancing ballerina]]\nBetween the two world wars most of the Swiss companies converted to the manufacture of other products requiring precise mechanical parts. Some went back to making watches, others were eventually responsible for the famous [[Bolex]] [[movie camera]]s and the Hermes [[typewriter]]s. Some simply sold out to Reuge.\n\nLocated near [[Lake Neuch\u00e2tel]], Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without [[automaton]]s in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr\u00e8res or Paillard. Since approximatively 2007 Reuge developed a strong business in the world of \"bespoke\" customized pieces for leaders in business and politics.\n\n[http://www.nidec-sankyo.co.jp/english/index.html Nidec Sankyo] in Japan started up in the aftermath of World War II, using the latest in automation. Modern production methods resulted in reasonable prices, producing company growth. Sankyo started with small movements, introduced 50-note movements by the late 1970s, and in 2006 is producing disc boxes playing discs as large as 16\" (with two 80-note combs and reminiscent of the \"Mira\") and are also working on a dual-cylinder 100-note movement. Sankyo now offers a wide variety of music boxes in Japan, and supplies movements to many other manufacturers and distributors. Some of these sell them retail (even online) to hobbyists for as low as 3 euros each. Sankyo Seiki bills itself as the biggest manufacturer of music boxes in the world and advertises that it controls 50% of the market. Recently, it has started selling licences for its musical-box tunes to [[cellular phone]] companies, for use as ring tones. The company is an industrial concern which also makes magnetic and hologram card readers, appliance components, industrial robots and miniature motors of all kinds.\n\nThe Porter Music Box company of [[Vermont]] produces steel disc music boxes in several formats. They offer clockwork, spring-wound models as well as electric ones. They stand out by their continuing production of discs, with a selection of about a thousand tunes. The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names.\n\nThe small 18-note musical movements are now being made almost exclusively in countries with low labour costs such as [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes.\n\nIn March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles. Band member [[Martin Molin]] used a hand crank to mobilize the marbles, which then created various noises on a vibraphone and other installed musical elements. <ref>\"[http://indiebandguru.com/wintergatan-marble-machine-amazes/ Wintergatan Marble Machine \u2013 A Feat of Both Music and Engineering]\", indiebandguru.com, Retrieved March 3, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Tevofy Technology Ltd., based in Taiwan, released the first app-controlled mechanical music box called [https://web.archive.org/web/20190626073605/https://murobox.com/en/index.html Muro Box], which stands for Music Robot in a Box. Unlike traditional music box, people do not need to punch holes to compose songs on a paper-strip music box. Also, there is no minimum order for making customized music box movement to play a selected song. Muro Box gives more freedom in composing songs and choosing songs to play on a music box. <ref>\u201cMuro Box Story.\u201d Muro Box, 26 June 2019, murobox.com/en/story/index.html.</ref>\n[[File:Muro Box.jpg|thumb|Muro Box, the first app-controlled music box.]]\n\n== Coin-operated models ==\n\nIn [[Switzerland]], coin-operated music boxes, usually capable of playing several tunes, were installed in places such as train stations and amusement parks. Some of the models had a mechanism for automatically changing the metal disks. These were, in a sense, the precursors to [[jukebox]]. However, they soon disappeared from their intended venues and were displaced by the jukebox, which could produce a greater variety of sounds and full songs rather than warped fragments.\n\nBecause most of the coin-operated music boxes were built for rough treatment (such as slapping and kicking by a customer), many of these large models have survived into the 21st century, despite their relatively low production quantities. They are sought by collectors who have the space for their large or very large cabinets.\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Music box elements.jpg|thumb|The ratchet) lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music. The whole thing rests on the bedplate [4].]]\n[[File:Music box with detachable handle - 2.jpg|thumb|Small fifty-tone musical box with detachable handle, possibly circa 1900]]\n[[File:How a Wind Up Music Box Works.webm|thumb|Explainer video]]\n*The bedplate is the relatively heavy metal foundation on which all the other pieces are fastened, usually by screws.\n*The ratchet lever or the windup key is used to put the spring motor under tension, which is to wind it up.\n*The spring motor or motors (two or more can be used to make playing times longer) give anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more of playing time.\n*The comb is a flat piece of metal with dozens or even hundreds of tuned teeth, or 'reeds', of different lengths.\n*The cylinder is the programming object, a metallic version of a [[punched card]] which instead of having holes to express a program, is studded with tiny pins at the correct spacing to produce music by displacing the teeth of the comb at the correct time. The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface.\n*Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a cylinder from one song or movement to the next.\n\n==Repertoire==\nIn 1974\u201375, German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'', a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the [[zodiac]], for twelve music boxes.<ref>Peter Andraschke, \"Kompositorische Tendenzen bei Karlheinz Stockhausen seit 1965\", in ''Zur Neuen Einfachheit in der Musik'', Studien zur Wertungsforschung 14, edited by Otto Kolleritsch, 126\u201343 (Vienna and Graz: Universal Edition [for the Institut f\u00fcr Wertungsforschung an der Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz], 1981). {{ISBN|3-7024-0153-9}}.</ref><ref>Giuliano d'Angiolini, \"''Tierkreis'', oeuvre pour instrument m\u00e9lodique et/ou harmonique: un tournant dans le parcours musical de Stockhausen\", ''Analyse Musicale'' (1989, 1er trimestre): 68\u201373.</ref><ref>Hermann Conen, ''Formel-Komposition: Zu Karlheinz Stockhausens Musik der siebziger Jahre'', K\u00f6lner Schriften zur Neuen Musik 1, edited by [[Johannes Fritsch]] and [[Dietrich K\u00e4mper]].

The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In [[Flanders]], in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known to us today as a \u201cmusic box\u201d developed from musical [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff box]]es of the 18th century and were originally called ''carillons \u00e0 musique'' (French for \"chimes of music\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny [[drum]] and/or [[bell]]s in addition to the metal comb.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8543.jpg|thumb|Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders]]\nThe original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat pocket. The music boxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by [[clockwork]] and originally produced by artisan [[watchmaker]]s. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.\n\nThe cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours.\n\n[[File:CIMA mg 8302.jpg|thumb|Music box using the metal disk system]]\nThe very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the [[Polyphon]] and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8498.jpg|thumb|Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played.]]\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8461.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestrion]]]]\nThe term \"music box\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \"programming\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified [[wind instrument]] or plucked the chords on a modified [[string instrument]]. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the [[Orchestrion]].\n\nThere were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century.\n\nThe [https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771 Symphonium] company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771|title=Hose, K.

No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties.  \u00a0 The company also pioneered the use of electric motors...the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos and phonographs.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile,  Polyphon expanded to America. where Brachhausen established the [[Regina Company|Regina Company.]] Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. \n\nIn the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \"juke-box\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in [[Long Beach, Washington]] (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The [[Musical Museum, Brentford]], [[London]] has a number of machines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |title=musicalmuseum.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035303/http://musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |archive-date=2011-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits.

Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down.\n\nCollectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \"Evolving Box Production\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that  add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs.\n\nMany kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers. A wide range of recordings and videos of historic music boxes is available on the web.\n\n===Timeline===\n{{prose|date=August 2012}}\n9th century: In Baghdad, Iraq, the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers, a trio of [[Inventions in the Islamic world|Persian inventors]], produced \"the earliest known mechanical musical instrument\", in this case a [[hydropower]]ed [[Organ (music)|organ]] which played interchangeable cylinders automatically, which they described in their ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]''.

In 1848, the manufacturing of the ''singing birds'' is improved by Blaise Bontems in his [[Paris]]ian workshop, to the point where it has remained unchanged to this day. Barrel organs become more popular.\n\n1796: [[Antoine Favre-Salomon]], a clockmaker from [[Geneva]] replaces the stack of bells by a comb with multiple pre-tuned metallic notes in order to reduce space. Together with a horizontally placed pinned barrel, this produces more varied and complex sounds. One of these first music boxes is now displayed at the [[Shanghai Gallery of Antique Music Boxes and Automata]] in [[Pudong]]'s [[Oriental Art Center]].<ref>[http://en.shoac.com.cn/Content.asp?nrID=141 en.shoac.com.cn], \"Antique Music Box Gallery\", accessed 18 Dec 2014.</ref> Numerous musical objects are produced in greater quantities in Geneva by several makers.\n\n1800: Isaac Daniel Piguet in Geneva produces repeating musical watches with a pinned horizontal disc operating radially arranged tuned steel teeth.\n\n1811: The first music boxes are produced in [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]]; an industry which surpasses the watchmaking and lace industries, and rapidly brings renown to the town. At this time, the musical-box industry represents 10% of Switzerland's export.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8521.jpg|thumb|Pocket watch with musical movements]]\n1865: Charles Reuge, a watchmaker from the [[Val-de-Travers]], settles in Sainte-Croix. He is one of many artisans making pocket watches with musical movements of the traditional calibre.\n\n1870: A German inventor creates a music box with discs, therefore allowing an easier and more frequent change of tunes. It is also the golden years of [[Automaton|automata]]. Already known in [[Egypt]], they will be improved to become real works of art.\n\n1877: [[Thomas Edison]] invents the [[phonograph]], which has important consequences for the musical-box industry, especially around the end of the century.\n\n1892: Gustave Brachhausen, who had been involved with the manufacturer of [[Polyphon]] disk music boxes in Germany, sails for America to establish the Regina Music Box Company in New Jersey. Regina, whose boxes are renowned among collectors for their tone, becomes a success and some 100,000 are sold before sales cease in 1921.\n\nEarly 20th century: The invention of the phonograph, the [[First World War]] and the economic crisis in the '20s bring down Sainte-Croix's main industry and make the luxury music box completely disappear.\n\n[[File:Caja musica.jpg|thumb|Music box with dancing ballerina]]\nBetween the two world wars most of the Swiss companies converted to the manufacture of other products requiring precise mechanical parts. Some went back to making watches, others were eventually responsible for the famous [[Bolex]] [[movie camera]]s and the Hermes [[typewriter]]s. Some simply sold out to Reuge.\n\nLocated near [[Lake Neuch\u00e2tel]], Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without [[automaton]]s in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr\u00e8res or Paillard. Since approximatively 2007 Reuge developed a strong business in the world of \"bespoke\" customized pieces for leaders in business and politics.\n\n[http://www.nidec-sankyo.co.jp/english/index.html Nidec Sankyo] in Japan started up in the aftermath of World War II, using the latest in automation. Modern production methods resulted in reasonable prices, producing company growth. Sankyo started with small movements, introduced 50-note movements by the late 1970s, and in 2006 is producing disc boxes playing discs as large as 16\" (with two 80-note combs and reminiscent of the \"Mira\") and are also working on a dual-cylinder 100-note movement. Sankyo now offers a wide variety of music boxes in Japan, and supplies movements to many other manufacturers and distributors. Some of these sell them retail (even online) to hobbyists for as low as 3 euros each. Sankyo Seiki bills itself as the biggest manufacturer of music boxes in the world and advertises that it controls 50% of the market. Recently, it has started selling licences for its musical-box tunes to [[cellular phone]] companies, for use as ring tones. The company is an industrial concern which also makes magnetic and hologram card readers, appliance components, industrial robots and miniature motors of all kinds.\n\nThe Porter Music Box company of [[Vermont]] produces steel disc music boxes in several formats. They offer clockwork, spring-wound models as well as electric ones. They stand out by their continuing production of discs, with a selection of about a thousand tunes. The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names.\n\nThe small 18-note musical movements are now being made almost exclusively in countries with low labour costs such as [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes.\n\nIn March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles. Band member [[Martin Molin]] used a hand crank to mobilize the marbles, which then created various noises on a vibraphone and other installed musical elements. <ref>\"[http://indiebandguru.com/wintergatan-marble-machine-amazes/ Wintergatan Marble Machine \u2013 A Feat of Both Music and Engineering]\", indiebandguru.com, Retrieved March 3, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Tevofy Technology Ltd., based in Taiwan, released the first app-controlled mechanical music box called [https://web.archive.org/web/20190626073605/https://murobox.com/en/index.html Muro Box], which stands for Music Robot in a Box. Unlike traditional music box, people do not need to punch holes to compose songs on a paper-strip music box. Also, there is no minimum order for making customized music box movement to play a selected song. Muro Box gives more freedom in composing songs and choosing songs to play on a music box. <ref>\u201cMuro Box Story.\u201d Muro Box, 26 June 2019, murobox.com/en/story/index.html.</ref>\n[[File:Muro Box.jpg|thumb|Muro Box, the first app-controlled music box.]]\n\n== Coin-operated models ==\n\nIn [[Switzerland]], coin-operated music boxes, usually capable of playing several tunes, were installed in places such as train stations and amusement parks. Some of the models had a mechanism for automatically changing the metal disks. These were, in a sense, the precursors to [[jukebox]]. However, they soon disappeared from their intended venues and were displaced by the jukebox, which could produce a greater variety of sounds and full songs rather than warped fragments.\n\nBecause most of the coin-operated music boxes were built for rough treatment (such as slapping and kicking by a customer), many of these large models have survived into the 21st century, despite their relatively low production quantities. They are sought by collectors who have the space for their large or very large cabinets.\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Music box elements.jpg|thumb|The ratchet lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music. The whole thing rests on the bedplate [4].]]\n[[File:Music box with detachable handle - 2.jpg|thumb|Small fifty-tone musical box with detachable handle, possibly circa 1900]]\n[[File:How a Wind Up Music Box Works.webm|thumb|Explainer video]]\n*The bedplate is the relatively heavy metal foundation on which all the other pieces are fastened, usually by screws.\n*The ratchet lever or the windup key is used to put the spring motor under tension, which is to wind it up.\n*The spring motor or motors (two or more can be used to make playing times longer) give anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more of playing time.\n*The comb is a flat piece of metal with dozens or even hundreds of tuned teeth, or 'reeds', of different lengths.\n*The cylinder is the programming object, a metallic version of a [[punched card]] which instead of having holes to express a program, is studded with tiny pins at the correct spacing to produce music by displacing the teeth of the comb at the correct time. The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface.\n*Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.\n\n==Repertoire==\nIn 1974\u201375, German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'', a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the [[zodiac]], for twelve music boxes.<ref>Peter Andraschke, \"Kompositorische Tendenzen bei Karlheinz Stockhausen seit 1965\", in ''Zur Neuen Einfachheit in der Musik'', Studien zur Wertungsforschung 14, edited by Otto Kolleritsch, 126\u201343 (Vienna and Graz: Universal Edition [for the Institut f\u00fcr Wertungsforschung an der Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz], 1981). {{ISBN|3-7024-0153-9}}.</ref><ref>Giuliano d'Angiolini, \"''Tierkreis'', oeuvre pour instrument m\u00e9lodique et/ou harmonique: un tournant dans le parcours musical de Stockhausen\", ''Analyse Musicale'' (1989, 1er trimestre): 68\u201373.</ref><ref>Hermann Conen, ''Formel-Komposition: Zu Karlheinz Stockhausens Musik der siebziger Jahre'', K\u00f6lner Schriften zur Neuen Musik 1, edited by [[Johannes Fritsch]] and [[Dietrich K\u00e4mper]].

[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator \"Demosthenes \u2013 greatest Greek orator\".] ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one who first recorded the teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.\n\nIn classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who were notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.\n\nSeparately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]  developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.\n\n===Rome===\n\nIn the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.\n\nThe Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome\u2014very wealthy and prominent members of society.\n\nThe Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking was seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a \"plain\" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.\n\n==Historical speeches==\n{{seealso|List of speeches}}\n\nDespite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied years after their delivery. Among these examples are:\n*[[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BC addressing those who died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]\n*Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863\n*Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in \"[[Ain't I a Woman?]] \n*Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.<ref>German, Kathleen M.

The two sisters faced disagreement by churches that did not agree with their public speaking as women {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.

Members learn by observation and practice, and hone their skills by listening to constructive suggestions followed by new public speaking exercises. These include:\n* Oratory\n* The use of [[Body language|gestures]]\n* Control of the [[voice]] ([[inflection]])\n* [[Vocabulary]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], word choice\n* Speaking notes, pitches\n* Using [[humor]]\n* Developing a relationship with the audience\n* \"Show of Hands Method\" (used primarily for [[Billboard]] presentations)\n* Extemporaneous and Enthusiastic Delivery\n* Effective Introduction\n*Efforts to Reach Hearts\n*Effective use of questions\nThe new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide actual examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to effectively use humour as a communication tool, and continuously researching in their topic area of focus.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Glossophobia==\n{{seealso|Glossophobia}}\nA common fear of public speaking is called [[glossophobia]] (or, informally, \"stage fright\"), this state of response by many beginners confuse with normal nerves and anxiety with a genuine phobia.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason= Ungrammatical sentence}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.psycom.net/glossophobia-fear-of-public-speaking |title=Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking): Are You Glossophobic? |last=Black |first=Rosemary |date=2018-06-04 |website=psycom.net |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Modern==\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Ettus Ted Talk 1.png|thumb|200px|Ettus Ted Talk]]\nNew technology has also opened different forms of public speaking that are nontraditional such as TED Talks,<ref>[[TED (conference)]]</ref> which are conferences that are broadcast globally. This form of public speaking has created a wider audience base because public speaking can now reach both physical and virtual audiences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gallo |first=Carmine |title=Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1466837270}}</ref> These audiences can be watching from all around the world. [[YouTube]] is another platform that allows public speaking to reach a larger audience. On YouTube, people can post videos of themselves.

For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a [[public address system]] or [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]].\n\nThese new forms of public speaking, which can be considered nontraditional, have opened up debates about whether or not these forms of public speaking are actually public speaking. Many people consider YouTube broadcasting to not be true forms of public speaking because there is not a  real, physical audience. Others argue that public speaking is about getting a group of people together in order to educate them further regardless of how or where the audience is located {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Telecommunication===\n[[Telecommunication]] and [[videoconferencing]] are also forms of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': \"Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems.\" This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.\n\n===Notable modern theorists===\n*[[Harold Lasswell]] developed [[Lasswell's model of communication]]. There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in this theory: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question \"''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?\"\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Audience response]]\n* [[Crowd manipulation]]\n* [[Debate]]\n* [[Eloquence]]\n* [[Glossophobia]]\n* [[List of speeches]]\n* [[Public orator]]\n*[[Persuasion]] \n* [[Rhetoric]]\n* [[Speechwriter]]\n* [[Speakers' bureau]]\n* [[Thematic interpretation]]\n* [[Toastmasters International]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Public speaking}}\n* {{dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Communication/Public_Speaking}}\n* [https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen How to speak so that people want to listen]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Public speaking| ]]\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Political science]]\n[[Category:Performing arts]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Process and act of speaking or giving a lecture to a group of people in a structured, deliberate manner intended to inform, influence, or entertain a listening audience}}\n{{For|the 2010 HBO documentary|Public Speaking (film)}}\n{{Redirect|Public speaker|a person who delivers an oration|Orator}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|300px|The Roman orator [[Cicero]] speaks to the Roman Senate.<br />''Cicero Denounces Catiline'' (1889), fresco by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]\n{{Communication}}\n{{Performing arts}}\n'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]].

This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one who first recorded the teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.\n\nIn classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who were notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.\n\nSeparately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]  developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.\n\n===Rome===\n\nIn the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.\n\nThe Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome\u2014very wealthy and prominent members of society.\n\nThe Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking was seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a \"plain\" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.\n\n==Historical speeches==\n{{seealso|List of speeches}}\n\nDespite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied years after their delivery. Among these examples are:\n*[[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BC addressing those who died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]\n*Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863\n*Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in \"[[Ain't I a Woman?]] \n*Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.<ref>German, Kathleen M.

The two sisters faced disagreement by churches that did not agree with their public speaking as women {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. Both sisters spoke about how slavery relates to women's' rights and why women need equality.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bizzell |first=Patricia |date=2010 |title=Chastity Warrants for Women Public Speakers in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction |journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=4 |page=17 |doi=10.1080/02773945.2010.501050}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques and trainings==\n\nEffective public speaking can be developed by joining a club such as [[Australian Rostrum|Rostrum]], [[Toastmasters International]], [[Association of Speakers Clubs]] (ASC), or [[Speaking Circles]], in which members are assigned exercises to improve their speaking skills. Members learn by observation and practice, and hone their skills by listening to constructive suggestions followed by new public speaking exercises. These include:\n* Oratory\n* The use of [[Body language|gestures]]\n* Control of the [[voice]] ([[inflection]])\n* [[Vocabulary]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], word choice\n* Speaking notes, pitches\n* Using [[humor]]\n* Developing a relationship with the audience\n* \"Show of Hands Method\" (used primarily for [[Billboard]] presentations)\n* Extemporaneous and Enthusiastic Delivery\n* Effective Introduction\n*Efforts to Reach Hearts\n*Effective use of questions\nThe new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide actual examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to effectively use humour as a communication tool, and continuously researching in their topic area of focus.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Glossophobia==\n{{seealso|Glossophobia}}\nA common fear of public speaking is called [[glossophobia]] (or, informally, \"stage fright\"), this state of response by many beginners confuse with normal nerves and anxiety with a genuine phobia.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason= Ungrammatical sentence}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.psycom.net/glossophobia-fear-of-public-speaking |title=Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking): Are You Glossophobic? |last=Black |first=Rosemary |date=2018-06-04 |website=psycom.net |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Modern==\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Ettus Ted Talk 1.png|thumb|200px|Ettus Ted Talk]]\nNew technology has also opened different forms of public speaking that are nontraditional such as TED Talks,<ref>[[TED (conference)]]</ref> which are conferences that are broadcast globally. This form of public speaking has created a wider audience base because public speaking can now reach both physical and virtual audiences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gallo |first=Carmine |title=Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1466837270}}</ref> These audiences can be watching from all around the world. [[YouTube]] is another platform that allows public speaking to reach a larger audience. On YouTube, people can post videos of themselves.

For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a [[public address system]] or [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]].\n\nThese new forms of public speaking, which can be considered nontraditional, have opened up debates about whether or not these forms of public speaking are actually public speaking. Many people consider YouTube broadcasting to not be true forms of public speaking because there is not a  real, physical audience. Others argue that public speaking is about getting a group of people together in order to educate them further regardless of how or where the audience is located {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Telecommunication===\n[[Telecommunication]] and [[videoconferencing]] are also forms of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': \"Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems.\" This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.\n\n===Notable modern theorists===\n*[[Harold Lasswell]] developed [[Lasswell's model of communication]]. There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in this theory: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question \"''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?\"\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Audience response]]\n* [[Crowd manipulation]]\n* [[Debate]]\n* [[Eloquence]]\n* [[Glossophobia]]\n* [[List of speeches]]\n* [[Public orator]]\n*[[Persuasion]] \n* [[Rhetoric]]\n* [[Speechwriter]]\n* [[Speakers' bureau]]\n* [[Thematic interpretation]]\n* [[Toastmasters International]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Public speaking}}\n* {{dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Communication/Public_Speaking}}\n* [https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen How to speak so that people want to listen]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Public speaking| ]]\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Political science]]\n[[Category:Performing arts]]\n", "name_user": "Purityn", "label": "safe", "comment": "The modern view of public speaking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking"}
