He was the first to articulate a vision for a \"College in the City of Boston\" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese. In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his [[cathedral]] and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Protestant elite]]. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the [[College of the Holy Cross]] {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by [[John McElroy (Jesuit)|John McElroy, S.J.]], who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for \"The Boston College\" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts]]. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings\u2014a schoolhouse and a [[Church (building)|church]]\u2014welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again. Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances. BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.\n[[File:OldBClithograph.jpg|thumb|left|Old BC in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]]]\nOn {{Start date|1863|3|31}}, more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. BC became the second [[Jesuit]] institution of higher learning in [[Massachusetts]] and the first located in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. [[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking [[Fribourg]], was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue. For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://bc.edu/about/history.html |title=History \u2013 Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=1909-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103122335/http://www.bc.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 3, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The curriculum was based on the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', emphasizing [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Move to Chestnut Hill===\n[[File:Gasson Tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]]]]\nBoston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though [[Boston College High School]] remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927 when it was separately [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In 1907, newly installed President [[Thomas I. Gasson]], S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by [[John Winthrop]]'s early vision of Boston as a \"[[city upon a hill]]\", he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of [[Jesuit]] scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased [[Amos Adams Lawrence]]'s farm on [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a [[campus]] master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the \"new\" university. Construction began in 1909.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and as a result [[Gasson Hall]], \"New BC's\" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. Buildings of the former Lawrence farm, including a barn and gatehouse, were temporarily adapted for college use while a massive fundraising effort was underway. While Maginnis's ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first \"capital campaign\"\u2014which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress\u2014ensured that President Gasson's vision survived. By the 1920s BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the [[Boston College Law School]], and the [[Woods College of Advancing Studies]], followed successively by the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], the [[Carroll School of Management]], the [[Connell School of Nursing]], and the [[Lynch School of Education|Lynch School of Education and Human Development]]. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President [[John F. Kennedy]], the nation's first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHP/1963/Month%2004/Day%2020/JFKWHP-1963-04-20-D|title=Trip to Boston: President Kennedy's Address at Boston College Centennial Ceremonies.

At the city, state and federal levels, BC graduates dominated Massachusetts politics for much of the 20th century. However, cultural changes in American society and in the church following the [[Second Vatican Council]] forced the university to question its purpose and mission. Meanwhile, poor financial management lead to deteriorating facilities and resources, and rising tuition costs. Student outrage, combined with growing protests over [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[Operation Menu|bombings in Cambodia]], culminated in student strikes, including demonstrations at [[Gasson Hall]] in April 1970.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Gasson Hall in Spring.jpg|Gasson Hall in spring\nFile:Gasson Hall in Summer.jpg|Gasson Hall in summer\nFile:Gasson Hall in Autumn.jpg|Gasson Hall in autumn\nFile:Gasson in Winter.jpg|Gasson Hall in winter\n</gallery>\n\n===The Monan Era===\nBy the time [[J. Donald Monan]], S.J. began his presidency on September 5, 1972, BC was approximately $30 million in debt, its endowment totaled just under $6 million, and faculty and staff salaries had been frozen during the previous year. Rumors about the university's future were rampant, including speculation that BC would be acquired by [[Harvard University]]. After Monan's appointment, the Boston College Board of Trustees was reconfigured.  The board was broadened beyond its historic membership of members of the [[Society of Jesus]], as lay alumni and business leaders were brought in, bringing new business models and an ability to raise funds. A similar restructuring had been accomplished first at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967 by Fr. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]], and Edmund Stephan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|title=Edmund Stephan, 86, Lawyer Who Reorganized Notre Dame|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1998-01-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813105624/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> with many other Catholic colleges following suit in the ensuing years. In 1974, [[Newton College of the Sacred Heart]] was merged into BC, allowing expansion of Boston College to the Newton College {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus. {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} Boston College Law School moved to the campus, and its dormitories provided needed housing for a student population that was increasingly residential, for which the school had to lease off-campus apartments and even motel rooms. Monan was credited with turning around the school's financial position, leading to an improved reputation and increasing attention from around the world. In 1996, Monan's 24-year presidency, the longest in the university's history, came to an end when he was named [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] and succeeded by President [[William P. Leahy]], S.J.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:BC Campus Green.jpg|thumb|right|Gasson Quadrangle]]\nSince assuming the Boston College presidency, Leahy's tenure has been marked with an acceleration of the growth and development initiated by his predecessor, as well as by what some critics see as abandonment of the college's initial mission to provide a college education for residents of Boston.  It has expanded by almost {{convert|150|acres|m2}}, while dramatically reducing the greenery of its middle campus, although portions of the college's legendary \"Dustbowl\" were removed to accommodate additional expansion of its buildings. During this period, undergraduate applications have surpassed 31,000.

Combining [[Gothic Revival]] architecture with principles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a [[cruciform]] plan. Maginnis's design broke from the traditional [[Oxbridge]] models that had inspired it\u2014and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. In its unprecedented scale, [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] was conceived not as the [[Bell tower|belfry]] of a singular building, but as the crowning [[campanile]] of Maginnis' new \"[[city upon a hill]]\". Although Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. Among these, the [[Bapst Library]] has been called the \"finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America\" and [[Devlin Hall]] won the [[Harleston Parker Medal]] for \"most beautiful building in Boston\". The 1895 [[Louis K. Liggett]] Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor-style]] upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though some of the modernist buildings at BC maintained non-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis's original designs.\n[[File:Boston College Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|right|Students walk through a campus quadrangle.]]\nBoston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes. Including manuscripts, journals, government documents and microform items, ranging from ancient papyrus scrolls to digital databases, the collections have some twelve million items. Together with the university's museums, they include original manuscripts and prints by [[Galileo]], [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and [[Francis Xavier]] as well as world-renowned collections in [[Jesuit]]ana, [[Ireland|Irish]] literature, sixteenth-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] tapestries, ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] pottery, [[Caribbean]] folk art and literature, [[Japanese art|Japanese prints]], [[United States federal government|U.S. government]] documents, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] Archives, and paintings that span the history of art from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. Opened in 1928, [[Bapst Library]] was named for the first president of Boston College ([[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis' original \"Oxford in America\" master plan.

Rather, the building houses the offices of the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank', the building is distinct from the quadrangle area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of the campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain in the middle of the courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10-year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, fresh coats of paint, and new ceiling tiles. The existing university 30\u201350-year plan schedules the reconstructed building to remain part of the quadrangle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392|title=Urban Legends of Boston College - Features - The Heights - Boston College|accessdate=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192700/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392|archivedate=April 16, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Fulton Hall Atrium.jpg|thumb|right|Fulton Hall atrium]]\n* McElroy Commons\nLocated on the Southwest Corner of middle campus, McElroy is referred to by students as 'Mac', reflecting the common, but incorrect, pronunciation of the building's name.

The Department today still has a large proportion of experts in continental philosophy including European philosophy and literature expert [[Richard Kearney]], expert in phenomenology [[John Sallis]], expert in Christian philosophy and apologetics [[Peter Kreeft]], and experts in social and political philosophy [[David M.

After receiving overwhelming approval from the university's board of [[trustees]], and UGBC president Dan Cotter, the Office of Minority Student Programs became the Office of AHANA Student Programs. The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where \"[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]\" is substituted for \"Hispanic\"), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a [[trademark]], has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the [[United States]].

They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports (except men's lacrosse) since the 2005-06 season. The Eagles formerly competed as a charter member of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] from 1979-80 to 2004-05. Up to that point, Boston College was the only Big East member affiliated with the Catholic Church that played football in the conference. All the football-playing members of the Big East are now secular (usually public) institutions. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), football, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse (non-ACC), sailing (non-ACC), skiing (non-ACC), soccer, swimming, tennis, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), field hockey, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse, rowing, sailing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in [[Hockey East]]; while the women's rowing team competes in the [[Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges]] (EAWRC) as well as the ACC; and the co-ed skiing, fencing and sailing teams are non-ACC/NCAA. Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.\n[[File:Ice Hockey Conte Forum.jpg|right|thumb|An ice hockey game played at \"Kelley Rink,\" Conte Forum.]] \nThe mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the [[Eagle]], generally referred to in the plural, i.e., \"The Eagles\". The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named [[Baldwin the Eagle|Baldwin]], derived from the \"bald\" head of the American bald eagle and the word \"win\". The school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The fight song, ''[[For Boston]]'', was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.\n[[File:Alumni Stadium Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Stadium, home of the Boston College Eagles.]]\nIn hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournaments held at [[TD Banknorth Garden]] and [[Fenway Park]], respectively. Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] [[Northeastern Huskies|Huskies]], [[Harvard University]] Crimson, and [[Boston University]] [[Boston University Terriers|Terriers]]. BC has reached the championship game 31 times and has won the Beanpot 16 times, including the 2010, 2011 and 2012 championships. The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008. The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[jetBlue Park]] after several years at [[City Of Palms Park]] both in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]], [[Florida]] during [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[spring training]]. The men's hockey team won the [[2008 NCAA Hockey Championship|2008 NCAA Championship]] on April 12, 2008 with a 4\u20131 victory over the University of Notre Dame in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]],  the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2010 NCAA Championship]] with a 5\u20130 victory over Wisconsin on April 10, 2010, and in 2012 in the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]]  with a 4-1 victory over [[Ferris State University]] in Tampa.\n\nPrincipal athletic facilities include [[Alumni Stadium]] (capacity: 44,500), [[Conte Forum]] (8,606), [[Kelley Rink]] (7,884), [[Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at John Shea Field]] (1,000), the Newton Soccer Complex (1,000), and the Flynn Recreation Complex.

He was the first to articulate a vision for a \"College in the City of Boston\" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese. In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his [[cathedral]] and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Protestant elite]]. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the [[College of the Holy Cross]] {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by [[John McElroy (Jesuit)|John McElroy, S.J.]], who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for \"The Boston College\" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts]]. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings\u2014a schoolhouse and a [[Church (building)|church]]\u2014welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again. Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances. BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.\n[[File:OldBClithograph.jpg|thumb|left|Old BC in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]]]\nOn {{Start date|1863|3|31}}, more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. BC became the second [[Jesuit]] institution of higher learning in [[Massachusetts]] and the first located in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. [[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking [[Fribourg]], was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue. For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://bc.edu/about/history.html |title=History \u2013 Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=1909-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103122335/http://www.bc.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 3, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The curriculum was based on the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', emphasizing [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Move to Chestnut Hill===\n[[File:Gasson Tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]]]]\nBoston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though [[Boston College High School]] remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927 when it was separately [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In 1907, newly installed President [[Thomas I. Gasson]], S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by [[John Winthrop]]'s early vision of Boston as a \"[[city upon a hill]]\", he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of [[Jesuit]] scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased [[Amos Adams Lawrence]]'s farm on [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a [[campus]] master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the \"new\" university. Construction began in 1909.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and as a result [[Gasson Hall]], \"New BC's\" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. Buildings of the former Lawrence farm, including a barn and gatehouse, were temporarily adapted for college use while a massive fundraising effort was underway. While Maginnis's ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first \"capital campaign\"\u2014which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress\u2014ensured that President Gasson's vision survived. By the 1920s BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the [[Boston College Law School]], and the [[Woods College of Advancing Studies]], followed successively by the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], the [[Carroll School of Management]], the [[Connell School of Nursing]], and the [[Lynch School of Education|Lynch School of Education and Human Development]]. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President [[John F. Kennedy]], the nation's first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHP/1963/Month%2004/Day%2020/JFKWHP-1963-04-20-D|title=Trip to Boston: President Kennedy's Address at Boston College Centennial Ceremonies.

At the city, state and federal levels, BC graduates dominated Massachusetts politics for much of the 20th century. However, cultural changes in American society and in the church following the [[Second Vatican Council]] forced the university to question its purpose and mission. Meanwhile, poor financial management lead to deteriorating facilities and resources, and rising tuition costs. Student outrage, combined with growing protests over [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[Operation Menu|bombings in Cambodia]], culminated in student strikes, including demonstrations at [[Gasson Hall]] in April 1970.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Gasson Hall in Spring.jpg|Gasson Hall in spring\nFile:Gasson Hall in Summer.jpg|Gasson Hall in summer\nFile:Gasson Hall in Autumn.jpg|Gasson Hall in autumn\nFile:Gasson in Winter.jpg|Gasson Hall in winter\n</gallery>\n\n===The Monan Era===\nBy the time [[J. Donald Monan]], S.J. began his presidency on September 5, 1972, BC was approximately $30 million in debt, its endowment totaled just under $6 million, and faculty and staff salaries had been frozen during the previous year. Rumors about the university's future were rampant, including speculation that BC would be acquired by [[Harvard University]]. After Monan's appointment, the Boston College Board of Trustees was reconfigured.  The board was broadened beyond its historic membership of members of the [[Society of Jesus]], as lay alumni and business leaders were brought in, bringing new business models and an ability to raise funds. A similar restructuring had been accomplished first at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967 by Fr. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]], and Edmund Stephan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|title=Edmund Stephan, 86, Lawyer Who Reorganized Notre Dame|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1998-01-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813105624/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> with many other Catholic colleges following suit in the ensuing years. In 1974, [[Newton College of the Sacred Heart]] was merged into BC, allowing expansion of Boston College to the Newton College {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus. {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} Boston College Law School moved to the campus, and its dormitories provided needed housing for a student population that was increasingly residential, for which the school had to lease off-campus apartments and even motel rooms. Monan was credited with turning around the school's financial position, leading to an improved reputation and increasing attention from around the world. In 1996, Monan's 24-year presidency, the longest in the university's history, came to an end when he was named [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] and succeeded by President [[William P. Leahy]], S.J.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:BC Campus Green.jpg|thumb|right|Gasson Quadrangle]]\nSince assuming the Boston College presidency, Leahy's tenure has been marked with an acceleration of the growth and development initiated by his predecessor, as well as by what some critics see as abandonment of the college's initial mission to provide a college education for residents of Boston.  It has expanded by almost {{convert|150|acres|m2}}, while dramatically reducing the greenery of its middle campus, although portions of the college's legendary \"Dustbowl\" were removed to accommodate additional expansion of its buildings. During this period, undergraduate applications have surpassed 31,000. At the same time, BC students, faculty and athletic teams have seen indicators of success\u2014winning record numbers of [[Fulbright Award|Fulbrights]], [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]], and other academic awards; setting new marks for research grants; and winning conference and national titles. In 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in light of the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|clergy sexual abuse scandal]].

Combining [[Gothic Revival]] architecture with principles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a [[cruciform]] plan. Maginnis's design broke from the traditional [[Oxbridge]] models that had inspired it\u2014and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. In its unprecedented scale, [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] was conceived not as the [[Bell tower|belfry]] of a singular building, but as the crowning [[campanile]] of Maginnis' new \"[[city upon a hill]]\". Although Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. Among these, the [[Bapst Library]] has been called the \"finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America\" and [[Devlin Hall]] won the [[Harleston Parker Medal]] for \"most beautiful building in Boston\". The 1895 [[Louis K. Liggett]] Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor-style]] upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though some of the modernist buildings at BC maintained non-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis's original designs.\n[[File:Boston College Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|right|Students walk through a campus quadrangle.]]\nBoston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes. Including manuscripts, journals, government documents and microform items, ranging from ancient papyrus scrolls to digital databases, the collections have some twelve million items. Together with the university's museums, they include original manuscripts and prints by [[Galileo]], [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and [[Francis Xavier]] as well as world-renowned collections in [[Jesuit]]ana, [[Ireland|Irish]] literature, sixteenth-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] tapestries, ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] pottery, [[Caribbean]] folk art and literature, [[Japanese art|Japanese prints]], [[United States federal government|U.S. government]] documents, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] Archives, and paintings that span the history of art from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. Opened in 1928, [[Bapst Library]] was named for the first president of Boston College ([[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis' original \"Oxford in America\" master plan.

Rather, the building houses the offices of the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank', the building is distinct from the quadrangle area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of the campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain in the middle of the courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10-year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, fresh coats of paint, and new ceiling tiles.

In the seventies, Boston College's Philosophy Department distinguished itself from the majority of American Departments by promoting the study of [[Continental philosophy|Continental European philosophy]] over and above [[analytic philosophy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html|title=Some Thoughts About \"Continental\" and \"Analytic\" Philosophy|publisher=|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507202622/http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html|archive-date=May 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Under the direction of Department Chair Joseph Flanagan, SJ and following the example of [[Fordham University]], the department branched out from its traditional strengths in philosophy of religion, ancient/medieval philosophy, and [[Thomism]].

Richardson]], SJ as well as experts in phenomenology [[Richard Cobb-Stevens]] and [[Jacques Taminiaux]]. The Department today still has a large proportion of experts in continental philosophy including European philosophy and literature expert [[Richard Kearney]], expert in phenomenology [[John Sallis]], expert in Christian philosophy and apologetics [[Peter Kreeft]], and experts in social and political philosophy [[David M. Rasmussen]] and James Bernauer, SJ. Since the seventies, the Department has also had a number of notable visiting professors including [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], and [[Bernard Lonergan]], SJ.\n\n==Student life==\n\n===AHANA===\nAHANA is the term Boston College uses to refer to persons of [[African-American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent.<ref>A Companion to Media Studies - Page 289 by Angharad N.

They cited the definition of the word [[minority group|minority]] as \"less than\" and proposed, instead, to use the term AHANA which they felt celebrated social cultural differences. After receiving overwhelming approval from the university's board of [[trustees]], and UGBC president Dan Cotter, the Office of Minority Student Programs became the Office of AHANA Student Programs. The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where \"[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]\" is substituted for \"Hispanic\"), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a [[trademark]], has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the [[United States]].

Conte Forum]]\n\nBoston College teams are known as the Eagles. They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports (except men's lacrosse) since the 2005-06 season. The Eagles formerly competed as a charter member of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] from 1979-80 to 2004-05. Up to that point, Boston College was the only Big East member affiliated with the Catholic Church that played football in the conference. All the football-playing members of the Big East are now secular (usually public) institutions. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), football, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse (non-ACC), sailing (non-ACC), skiing (non-ACC), soccer, swimming, tennis, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), field hockey, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse, rowing, sailing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in [[Hockey East]]; while the women's rowing team competes in the [[Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges]] (EAWRC) as well as the ACC; and the co-ed skiing, fencing and sailing teams are non-ACC/NCAA. Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.\n[[File:Ice Hockey Conte Forum.jpg|right|thumb|An ice hockey game played at \"Kelley Rink,\" Conte Forum.]] \nThe mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the [[Eagle]], generally referred to in the plural, i.e., \"The Eagles\". The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named [[Baldwin the Eagle|Baldwin]], derived from the \"bald\" head of the American bald eagle and the word \"win\". The school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The fight song, ''[[For Boston]]'', was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.\n[[File:Alumni Stadium Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Stadium, home of the Boston College Eagles.]]\nIn hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournaments held at [[TD Banknorth Garden]] and [[Fenway Park]], respectively. Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] [[Northeastern Huskies|Huskies]], [[Harvard University]] Crimson, and [[Boston University]] [[Boston University Terriers|Terriers]]. BC has reached the championship game 31 times and has won the Beanpot 16 times, including the 2010, 2011 and 2012 championships. The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008. The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[jetBlue Park]] after several years at [[City Of Palms Park]] both in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]], [[Florida]] during [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[spring training]].

{"title_page": "Drug liberalization", "text_new": "{{short description|Process of eliminating or reducing drug prohibition laws}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n'''Drug liberalization''' is the process of eliminating or reducing [[Prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]] laws. Variations of drug liberalization include: '''drug legalization''', '''drug relegalization''' and '''drug decriminalization'''.<ref>[https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/committee/371/ille/03evb-e Proceedings of the Special Committee on Illegal Drugs], Senate of Canada, 28 May 2001</ref>\n\n== Policies ==\nThe 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] made it mandatory for the signatory countries to \"adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law\" (art. 3, \u00a7&nbsp;1) all the activities related to the production, sale, transport, distribution, etc. of the substances included in the most restricted lists of the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. Criminalization also applies to the \"cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush or cannabis plants for the purpose of the production of narcotic drugs\". The Convention distinguishes between the intent to traffic and personal consumption, stating that the latter should also be considered a criminal offence, but \"subject to the constitutional principles and the basic concepts of [the state\u2019s] legal system\" (art. 3, \u00a7&nbsp;2).<ref name=reform>[https://www.tni.org/en/paper/drug-policy-reform-practice Drug Policy Reform in Practice: Experiences with alternatives in Europe and the US], Tom Blickman & Martin Jelsma, Transnational Institute, July 2009.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) defines decriminalization as the removal of a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law; depenalisation signifying merely a relaxation of the penal sanction exacted by law. Decriminalization usually applies to offences related to drug consumption and may include either the imposition of sanctions of a different kind (administrative) or the abolition of all sanctions; other (noncriminal) laws then regulate the conduct or activity that has been decriminalized. Depenalisation usually consists of personal consumption as well as small-scale trading and generally signifies the elimination or reduction of custodial penalties, while the conduct or activity still remains a criminal offence. The term legalization refers to the removal of all drug-related offences from criminal law: use, possession, cultivation, production, trading, etc.<ref name=reform /><ref name=emcdda>[http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_10080_EN_EMCDDATP_01.pdf Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches], EMCDDA thematic papers, Lisbon 2005</ref>\n\nDrug liberalization proponents hold differing reasons to support liberalization, and have differing policy proposals. The two most common positions are '''drug legalization''' (or re-legalization), and '''drug decriminalization'''.\n\n=== Drug legalization ===\nDrug legalization calls for a return to the pre-20th century situation in which almost all drugs were legal. This would require ending government-enforced prohibition on the distribution or sale and personal use of specified (or all) currently banned drugs. Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (12 Nov 2009)</ref>\n* Mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings.\n* Restrictions on advertising.\n* Age limitations.\n* Restrictions on amount purchased at one time.\n* Requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied.\n* Ban on sale to intoxicated persons.\n* Special user licenses to purchase particular drugs.\n* A possible clinical setting for the consumption of some intravenous drugs and/or supervised consumption. \nThe regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2010/02/regulation-saves-lives.html Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (3 Feb 2010)</ref> and ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits).\n\nFull legalization is often proposed by groups such as [[libertarians]] who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug legalization does not imply approval of drug use.<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2009/12/reformers-are-not-pro-drug-mr-costa.html Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (7 Dec 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7 Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs Eleven Years Ago And The Results Are Staggering], [[Business Insider]] (17 Jul 2012)</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Boaz|first1=David|title=Let's Quit the Drug War|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/lets-quit-drug-war|website=Cato Institute|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=en|date=17 March 1988|quote=This article originally appeared in the New York Times on March 17, 1988}}</ref>\n\n=== Drug decriminalization ===\nDrug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or other punishments to replace [[prison]] terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of [[harm reduction]].\n\nDrug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being \"the worst of both worlds\", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. However, there are many that argue that the decriminalization of possession of drugs would redirect focus of the law enforcement system of any country to put more effort into arresting dealers and big time criminals, instead of arresting minor criminals for mere possession, and thus be more effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 2001 Portugal began treating use and possession of small quantities of drugs as a public health issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/|title=Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}</ref> This means that, rather than incarcerating those in possession, they are referred to a treatment program. The drugs are still illegal, the police just handles the situation differently. This also decreases the amount of money the government spends fighting a war on drugs and money spent keeping drug users incarcerated.\n\"As noted by the EMCDDA, across Europe in the last decades, there has been a movement toward \"an approach that distinguishes between the drug traf\ufb01cker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person who is in need of treatment\" (EMCDDA 2008, 22).6 A number of Latin American countries have similarly moved to reduce the penalties associated with drug use and personal possession\" (Laqueur, 2015, p.&nbsp;748).\n[[Portugal]] is the first country that has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, to positive results.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html | work=Time | first=Maia | last=Szalavitz | title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? | date=26 April 2009}}</ref> Anyone caught with any type of drug in Portugal, if it is for personal consumption, will not be imprisoned.\n\n== Economics ==\nThere are numerous economic and social impacts of the criminalization of drugs. Prohibition increases crime (theft, violence, corruption) and drug price and increases potency.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Thornton\n  | first = Mark\n  | title = The Economics of Prohibition\n  | url=http://mises.org/story/2269\n   | date = 2006-07-31\n  }}</ref> In many developing countries the production of drugs offers a way to escape poverty. [[Milton Friedman]] estimated that over 10,000 deaths a year in the US are caused by the criminalization of drugs, and if drugs were to be made legal innocent victims such as those shot down in drive by shootings, would cease or decrease. The economic inefficiency and ineffectiveness of such government intervention in preventing drug trade has been fiercely criticised by drug-liberty advocates. The [[War on Drugs]] of the United States, that provoked legislation within several other Western governments, has also garnered criticism for these reasons.\n\n=== Prices and consumption ===\nMuch of the debate surrounding the economics of drug legalization centers on the shape of the demand curve for illegal drugs and the sensitivity of consumers to changes in the prices of illegal drugs.<ref name=Clark>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew E.|title=The Economics of Drug Legalization|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060914/http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|url-status=live|archive-date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref> Proponents of drug legalization often assume that the quantity of addictive drugs consumed is unresponsive to changes in price; however, studies into addictive, but legal, substances like alcohol and cigarettes, have shown that consumption can be quite responsive to changes in prices.<ref name=Grossman>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Michael|author2=Frank J.

In the 20th century, the United States government led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the \"[[War on Drugs]].\" It was only in the 20th Century that Britain and the United States outlawed cannabis. The British had gone to war with China in the 19th Century in what became known as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s to protect their valuable trade in narcotics.\n\nMotivations claimed by supporters of drug prohibition laws across various societies and eras have included [[religious observance]], allegations of violence by [[racial minorities]], and [[public health]] concerns. Those who are not proponents of anti-drug legislation characterize these motivations as [[religious intolerance]], [[racism]], and [[public healthism]].\n\nVarious proponents of drug liberalization wish to repeal these laws for [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|reasons]] ranging from [[individual rights]]-based defenses of [[liberty]], to [[consequentialist]] arguments against the economic and social outcomes of drug prohibition. Starting in the 20th century, large organized movements to overturn existing drug laws formed around the world. The most vocal of these groups exist in [[liberal democracies]], and typically attract [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] supporters, although drug liberalization itself is a non-partisan issue and may be supported by adherents of any ideology.\n\nThe campaign against [[alcohol prohibition]] culminated in the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealing prohibition on 5 December 1933, as well as liberalization in [[Canada]], and some but not all of the other countries that enforced prohibition. However, many laws controlling the use of alcohol continue to exist even in these countries.\n\nCurrent proponents of drug liberalization seek the repeal or softening of drug prohibition laws, most commonly [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also including other [[controlled substance]]s such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[opiate]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[dissociative]]s, [[prescription drug]]s, and others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Policies by country ==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Thailand====\nAlthough [[Thailand]] has a strict [[drug policy]], in May 2018, the Cabinet approved draft legislation that allows for more research into the effects of marijuana on people.

The court considered that basing a decision on mere Regulation would be unconstitutional and in breach of Article 39 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms|Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]] which states that \"''only a law may designate which acts constitute a crime and what penalties, or other detriments to rights or property, may be imposed for committing them''\" and proposed to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] to abolish the Regulation. In line with the District Courts' argument, the Constitutional Court abolished the Regulation effective from 23 August 2013, noting that the \"''amount larger than small''\" within the meaning of the Criminal Code may be designated only by the means of an Act of Parliament, and not a Governmental Regulation. Moreover, the Constitutional Court further noted that the Regulation merely took over already existing judicial practice of interpretation of what constitutes \"''amount larger than small''\" and thus its abolishment will not really change the criminality of drug possession in the country.<ref name=\"concourt\">{{Citation\n| last       = Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic\n| year       = 2013\n| title      = Ruling No. 259/2013 Coll.\n| publisher  =\n| location = Brno\n| page       =\n| url        =\n| accessdate =\n| language   = Czech\n}}</ref> Thus, the above-mentioned amounts from the now-not-effective Regulation remain as the base for consideration of police and prosecutors, while courts are not bound by the precise grammage.\n\nSale of any amount (not purchase) remains a criminal act.

The reform titled \"From punishment to help\" was approved by the Norwegian government in 2017 and is now in the final phase of approval by the parliament. Changes are expected to be implemented by early 2021. The new reform policy emphasizes that criminalizing drug use has no significant effect on rates of drug consumption and that drug addiction is better dealt with by health care services, hence the slogan \"from punishment to help\". Instead of fines or prison time, a person caught with a drug quantity for personal use will now be met with an independent panel consisting of social and health care workers that will discuss administrative sanctions or addiction treatment methods. This will hopefully encourage problematic users to seek help rather than fear of prosecution. There is also hope that this will improve the relationship between drug users and law enforcement officers.

A disparity exists between the decriminalization of drug use and the increased penalization of selling drugs, punishable with a maximum prison sentences of 5 years for the sale of very minor quantities of drugs. Most of those incarcerated for drug trafficking are offenders caught selling small quantities of drugs, among them drug users who sell drugs to finance their drug habits. Since 2006, there's been a long debate whether the anti-drug law goes against the Constitution and principle of personal freedom.

Criminalization also applies to the \"cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush or cannabis plants for the purpose of the production of narcotic drugs\". The Convention distinguishes between the intent to traffic and personal consumption, stating that the latter should also be considered a criminal offence, but \"subject to the constitutional principles and the basic concepts of [the state\u2019s] legal system\" (art. 3, \u00a7&nbsp;2).<ref name=reform>[https://www.tni.org/en/paper/drug-policy-reform-practice Drug Policy Reform in Practice: Experiences with alternatives in Europe and the US], Tom Blickman & Martin Jelsma, Transnational Institute, July 2009.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) defines decriminalization as the removal of a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law; depenalisation signifying merely a relaxation of the penal sanction exacted by law. Decriminalization usually applies to offences related to drug consumption and may include either the imposition of sanctions of a different kind (administrative) or the abolition of all sanctions; other (noncriminal) laws then regulate the conduct or activity that has been decriminalized. Depenalisation usually consists of personal consumption as well as small-scale trading and generally signifies the elimination or reduction of custodial penalties, while the conduct or activity still remains a criminal offence. The term legalization refers to the removal of all drug-related offences from criminal law: use, possession, cultivation, production, trading, etc.<ref name=reform /><ref name=emcdda>[http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_10080_EN_EMCDDATP_01.pdf Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches], EMCDDA thematic papers, Lisbon 2005</ref>\n\nDrug liberalization proponents hold differing reasons to support liberalization, and have differing policy proposals. The two most common positions are '''drug legalization''' (or re-legalization), and '''drug decriminalization'''.\n\n=== Drug legalization ===\nDrug legalization calls for a return to the pre-20th century situation in which almost all drugs were legal. This would require ending government-enforced prohibition on the distribution or sale and personal use of specified (or all) currently banned drugs. Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (12 Nov 2009)</ref>\n* Mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings.\n* Restrictions on advertising.\n* Age limitations.\n* Restrictions on amount purchased at one time.\n* Requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied.\n* Ban on sale to intoxicated persons.\n* Special user licenses to purchase particular drugs.\n* A possible clinical setting for the consumption of some intravenous drugs and/or supervised consumption. \nThe regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2010/02/regulation-saves-lives.html Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (3 Feb 2010)</ref> and ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits).\n\nFull legalization is often proposed by groups such as [[libertarians]] who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug legalization does not imply approval of drug use.<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2009/12/reformers-are-not-pro-drug-mr-costa.html Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (7 Dec 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7 Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs Eleven Years Ago And The Results Are Staggering], [[Business Insider]] (17 Jul 2012)</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Boaz|first1=David|title=Let's Quit the Drug War|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/lets-quit-drug-war|website=Cato Institute|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=en|date=17 March 1988|quote=This article originally appeared in the New York Times on March 17, 1988}}</ref>\n\n=== Drug decriminalization ===\nDrug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or other punishments to replace [[prison]] terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of [[harm reduction]].\n\nDrug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being \"the worst of both worlds\", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. However, there are many that argue that the decriminalization of possession of drugs would redirect focus of the law enforcement system of any country to put more effort into arresting dealers and big time criminals, instead of arresting minor criminals for mere possession, and thus be more effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 2001 Portugal began treating use and possession of small quantities of drugs as a public health issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/|title=Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}</ref> This means that, rather than incarcerating those in possession, they are referred to a treatment program. The drugs are still illegal, the police just handles the situation differently. This also decreases the amount of money the government spends fighting a war on drugs and money spent keeping drug users incarcerated.\n\"As noted by the EMCDDA, across Europe in the last decades, there has been a movement toward \"an approach that distinguishes between the drug traf\ufb01cker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person who is in need of treatment\" (EMCDDA 2008, 22).6 A number of Latin American countries have similarly moved to reduce the penalties associated with drug use and personal possession\" (Laqueur, 2015, p.&nbsp;748).\n[[Portugal]] is the first country that has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, to positive results.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html | work=Time | first=Maia | last=Szalavitz | title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? | date=26 April 2009}}</ref> Anyone caught with any type of drug in Portugal, if it is for personal consumption, will not be imprisoned.\n\n== Economics ==\nThere are numerous economic and social impacts of the criminalization of drugs.

[[Milton Friedman]] estimated that over 10,000 deaths a year in the US are caused by the criminalization of drugs, and if drugs were to be made legal innocent victims such as those shot down in drive by shootings, would cease or decrease. The economic inefficiency and ineffectiveness of such government intervention in preventing drug trade has been fiercely criticised by drug-liberty advocates. The [[War on Drugs]] of the United States, that provoked legislation within several other Western governments, has also garnered criticism for these reasons.\n\n=== Prices and consumption ===\nMuch of the debate surrounding the economics of drug legalization centers on the shape of the demand curve for illegal drugs and the sensitivity of consumers to changes in the prices of illegal drugs.<ref name=Clark>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew E.|title=The Economics of Drug Legalization|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060914/http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|url-status=live|archive-date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref> Proponents of drug legalization often assume that the quantity of addictive drugs consumed is unresponsive to changes in price; however, studies into addictive, but legal, substances like alcohol and cigarettes, have shown that consumption can be quite responsive to changes in prices.<ref name=Grossman>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Michael|author2=Frank J.

They believe that by sending such a large number of drug offenders to prison, the war on drugs has reduced the prison space available for other offenders. This increased incarceration rate not only costs tax payers more to maintain, it could possibly increase crime by crowding violent offenders out of prison cells and replacing them with drug offenders.<ref name=\"Levitt\" />{{rp|2043}}\n\n=== Direct costs ===\nA [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist, [[Jeffrey Miron]], estimated that ending the war on drugs would inject 76.8 billion dollars into the US economy in 2010 alone.<ref name=Bernd>{{cite news|last=Debusmann|first=Bernd|title=Einstein, Insanity and the War on Drugs|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2008/12/03/einstein-insanity-and-the-war-on-drugs/|accessdate=4/1/12|newspaper=Reuter|date=12/3/08}}</ref> He estimates that the government would save $41.3 billion for law enforcement and the government would gain up to $46.7 billion in tax revenue.<ref name=Cato>{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Katherine Waldock|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition|journal=The Cato Institute|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/budgetary-impact-ending-drug-prohibition|date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nSince the war on drugs began under the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|administration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the federal drug-fighting budget has increased from $100 million in 1970 to $15.1 billion in 2010, with a total cost estimated near 1 trillion dollars over 40 years.

In the 20th century, the United States government led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the \"[[War on Drugs]].\" It was only in the 20th Century that Britain and the United States outlawed cannabis. The British had gone to war with China in the 19th Century in what became known as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s to protect their valuable trade in narcotics.\n\nMotivations claimed by supporters of drug prohibition laws across various societies and eras have included [[religious observance]], allegations of violence by [[racial minorities]], and [[public health]] concerns. Those who are not proponents of anti-drug legislation characterize these motivations as [[religious intolerance]], [[racism]], and [[public healthism]].\n\nVarious proponents of drug liberalization wish to repeal these laws for [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|reasons]] ranging from [[individual rights]]-based defenses of [[liberty]], to [[consequentialist]] arguments against the economic and social outcomes of drug prohibition. Starting in the 20th century, large organized movements to overturn existing drug laws formed around the world. The most vocal of these groups exist in [[liberal democracies]], and typically attract [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] supporters, although drug liberalization itself is a non-partisan issue and may be supported by adherents of any ideology.\n\nThe campaign against [[alcohol prohibition]] culminated in the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealing prohibition on 5 December 1933, as well as liberalization in [[Canada]], and some but not all of the other countries that enforced prohibition. However, many laws controlling the use of alcohol continue to exist even in these countries.\n\nCurrent proponents of drug liberalization seek the repeal or softening of drug prohibition laws, most commonly [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also including other [[controlled substance]]s such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[opiate]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[dissociative]]s, [[prescription drug]]s, and others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Policies by country ==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Thailand====\nAlthough [[Thailand]] has a strict [[drug policy]], in May 2018, the Cabinet approved draft legislation that allows for more research into the effects of marijuana on people. Thus, the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) will soon begin clinical trials of marijuana as a preliminary step in the production of drugs from this plant. These medical studies are considered exciting, new landmarks in the history of Thailand, because since 1979, marijuana is a drug and its use, storage and manufacture is illegal.<ref>https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1546686/medical-marijuana-trials-to-start-soon</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 2018, the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] officially proposed to allow licensed medical use of marijuana, thereby legalizing what was previously considered a dangerous drug.\n\nThe National Assembly on Friday submitted its amendments to the Ministry of Health, which would place marijuana and vegetable kratom in the category allowing their licensed possession and distribution in regulated conditions. The ministry reviewed the amendments before sending them to the cabinet, which returned it to the National Assembly for a final vote.

These amounts were higher (often many times) than in any other European country, possibly making the Czech Republic the most liberal country in the [[European Union]] when it comes to drug liberalization, apart from Portugal.<ref>[http://www.praguepost.com/news/3194-new-drug-guidelines-are-europes-most-liberal.html New drug guidelines are Europe's most liberal], The Prague Post, 23 December 2009</ref> Czech Republic has also the highest prevalence of last years cannabis use among young adults (15-34) (18.5% in 2012) among the 30 counties reporting to the [[EMCDDA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/2014|title=EMCDDA \u2013 European Drug Report 2014: Data and statistics \u2014 the drug situation in Europe|work=europa.eu}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Regulation No. 467/2009 Coll, possession of the following amounts or less of illicit drugs was to be considered smaller than large for the purposes of the Criminal Code and was to be treated as a misdemeanor subject to a fine equal to a parking ticket:<ref name=\"Cz reg\">{{Citation\n| last       = Government of the Czech Republic\n| year       = 2009\n| title      = Regulation No. 467/2009 Coll., which defines for the purposes of the Criminal Code what is to be considered larger than small amount of narcotic and psychoactive substances and poisons\n| publisher  =\n| location = Prague\n| page       =\n| url        =\n| accessdate =\n| language   = Czech\n}}</ref>\n* [[Marijuana]] 15&nbsp;grams (or five plants)\n* [[Hashish]] 5&nbsp;grams\n* [[Magic mushrooms]] 40 pieces\n* [[Peyote]] 5 plants\n* [[LSD]] 5 tablets\n* [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]] 4 tablets\n* [[Amphetamine]] 2&nbsp;grams\n* [[Methamphetamine]] 2&nbsp;grams\n* [[Heroin]] 1.5&nbsp;grams\n* [[Coca]] 5 plants\n* [[Cocaine]] 1&nbsp;gram\n\nIn 2013, a District Court in [[Liberec]] was deciding a case of a person that was accused of criminal possession for having 3.25 grams of methamphetamine (1.9 grams of straight methamphetamine base), well over the Regulation's limit of 2 grams. The court considered that basing a decision on mere Regulation would be unconstitutional and in breach of Article 39 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms|Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]] which states that \"''only a law may designate which acts constitute a crime and what penalties, or other detriments to rights or property, may be imposed for committing them''\" and proposed to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] to abolish the Regulation. In line with the District Courts' argument, the Constitutional Court abolished the Regulation effective from 23 August 2013, noting that the \"''amount larger than small''\" within the meaning of the Criminal Code may be designated only by the means of an Act of Parliament, and not a Governmental Regulation. Moreover, the Constitutional Court further noted that the Regulation merely took over already existing judicial practice of interpretation of what constitutes \"''amount larger than small''\" and thus its abolishment will not really change the criminality of drug possession in the country.<ref name=\"concourt\">{{Citation\n| last       = Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic\n| year       = 2013\n| title      = Ruling No. 259/2013 Coll.\n| publisher  =\n| location = Brno\n| page       =\n| url        =\n| accessdate =\n| language   = Czech\n}}</ref> Thus, the above-mentioned amounts from the now-not-effective Regulation remain as the base for consideration of police and prosecutors, while courts are not bound by the precise grammage.\n\nSale of any amount (not purchase) remains a criminal act.

The reform titled \"From punishment to help\" was approved by the Norwegian government in 2017 and is now in the final phase of approval by the parliament. Changes are expected to be implemented by early 2021. The new reform policy emphasizes that criminalizing drug use has no significant effect on rates of drug consumption and that drug addiction is better dealt with by health care services, hence the slogan \"from punishment to help\". Instead of fines or prison time, a person caught with a drug quantity for personal use will now be met with an independent panel consisting of social and health care workers that will discuss administrative sanctions or addiction treatment methods. This will hopefully encourage problematic users to seek help rather than fear of prosecution. There is also hope that this will improve the relationship between drug users and law enforcement officers. Opponents of the reform, including the police force and the progress party, fear that drug use will increase once a person is no longer at risk of facing criminal charges.  <ref> https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/hod/org/styrer-rad-og-utvalg/rusreformutvalget/id2594880</ref>\n\n==== Portugal ====\n{{Main|Drug policy of Portugal}}\nIn 2001, [[Portugal]] became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession, under Law 30/2000.<ref>{{cite\n|first = Alex\n|last = Stevens\n|title = The effects of decriminalization of drug use in Portugal\n|date = 2007\n|url = https://kar.kent.ac.uk/13325/\n}}</ref> In addition, drug users were to be provided with [[Drug therapy|therapy]] rather than prison sentences.

With the advent of instant communications and rapid information transfer, a great deal of actionable and predictive intelligence can now be obtained from public, unclassified sources.\n\n==Principles==\nOpen Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/tip/Using-open-source-intelligence-software-for-cybersecurity-intelligence|title=Using open source intelligence software for cybersecurity intelligence|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=June 2012|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> OSINT is primarily used in [[national security]], [[law enforcement]], and [[competitive intelligence|business intelligence]] functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering [[classified information|classified]], [[classified information|unclassified]], or [[trade secret|proprietary intelligence]] [[intelligence requirement|requirements]] across the previous intelligence disciplines.\n\nOSINT sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The US Intelligence Community |asin=0813349184 }}</ref>\n\n*'''Media''', print [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[radio]], and [[television]] from across and between countries.\n*'''[[Internet]]''', [[online publication]]s, [[blogs]], [[discussion group]]s, citizen media (i.e. \u2013 cell phone [[digital video|videos]], and [[user created content]]), [[YouTube]], and other [[social]] media websites (i.e. \u2013 [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram|<span lang=\"vi\">Instagram</span>]], etc.).  This source also outpaces a variety of other sources due to its timeliness and ease of access.\n*'''Public Government Data''', public government reports, budgets, hearings, [[telephone directories]], press conferences, websites, and speeches.

Richelson]], \u201copen source acquisition involves procuring verbal, written, or electronically transmitted material that can be obtained legally. In addition to documents and videos available via the [[Internet]] or provided by a human source, others are obtained after U.S. or allied forces have taken control of a facility or site formerly operated by a foreign government or [[terrorist]] group.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richelson|first1=Jeffrey T|authorlink1=Jeffrey T.

The Center was established to collect information available from \"the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery.\"<ref>Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \"[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm ODNI Announces Establishment of Open Source Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623072458/http://dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}\". Press release, 8 November 2005.</ref> In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information. The center absorbed the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s previously existing [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), originally established in 1941, with FBIS head Douglas Naquin named as director of the center.<ref>Ensor, David. \"[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/08/sr.tues/ The Situation Report: Open source intelligence center]\".

Specifically, [[In-Q-Tel]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] supported venture capital firm in Arlington, VA assisted companies develop web-monitoring and predictive analysis tools.\n\nIn December 2005, the Director of National Intelligence appointed [[Eliot A.

The amount of data being distributed increases at a rate that it becomes difficult to [[Words of estimative probability|evaluate sources]] in [[intelligence analysis]].\n\nAccredited journalists have some protection in asking questions, and researching for recognized media outlets. Even so, they can be imprisoned, even executed, for seeking out OSINT. Private individuals illegally collecting data for a foreign military or intelligence agency is considered [[espionage]] in most countries. Of course, espionage that is not [[treason]] (i.e. betraying one's country of citizenship) has been a tool of statecraft since ancient times.<ref>[[Sun Tzu]] ([[Warring States period]]), ''[[The Art of War]]'', Chapter 13: \"Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of 2 hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.\"</ref>\n\n==Value==\nOSINT is valuable because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation processes and timelines than more technical intelligence disciplines such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], [[Measurement and signature intelligence|MASINT]], [[Geospatial intelligence|GEOINT]], etc. Additionally, OSINT collects a valuable variety of opinions because it encompasses a great variety of sources.\n\nAccording to the [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]] report submitted in March 2005, OSINT must be included in the all-source intelligence process for the following reasons (as stated in the report):\n\n#The ever-shifting nature of intelligence needs compels the IC (Intelligence Community) to quickly and easily understand a wide range of foreign countries and cultures. \u2013 \u2026 today's threats are rapidly changing and geographically diffuse; an intelligence analyst may be forced to shift rapidly from one topic to the next. Increasingly, IC professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a country\u2014information often detailed in open sources.\n#Open-source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited, and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. A notable example relates to terrorism, where open-source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.\n#Open-source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open-source reporting. This can prove useful when policy-makers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.\n#Only open source can ''store history''. A robust open-source program can, in effect, gather data to monitor the world's cultures and how they change with time. This is difficult, if not impossible, using the ''snapshots'' provided by classified collection methods.<ref>(The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities, 378\u2013379). [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]]</ref>\n\n==Process==\nOSINT is a highly diverse form of intelligence collection and analysis. It does not have its own agency, however, units are scattered within the Department of Defense and the State Department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/Vol49no2/reexamining_the_distinction_3.htm|title=Reexamining the Distinction Between Open Information and Secrets \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> Most OSINT collectors need to take precautions while collecting information from the Internet. This can come in the form of using a [[Virtual private network|VPN]] to [[anonymize]] their identity and collect information more discreetly. This is where evaluating sources becomes important to the overall OSINT collection and analysis process. An OSINT analyst needs intelligence evaluation to determine a true process or expose a false process that would affect predicting the future. Finally, the analysts need to find use of the evaluated intelligence so that it can be incorporated into a finished classified, unclassified, or proprietary intelligence product.\n\n{{See also|Big Data}}\n[[Information collection]] in OSINT is generally a different problem from collection in other intelligence disciplines where obtaining the raw information to be analyzed may be the major difficulty, particularly if it is to be obtained from non-cooperative targets. In OSINT, the chief difficulty is in identifying relevant, reliable sources from the vast amount of publicly available information.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=R1YMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=In+OSINT,+the+chief+difficulty+is+in+identifying+relevant,+reliable+sources+from+the+vast+amount+of+publicly+available+information.#v=onepage&q=In%20OSINT%2C%20the%20chief%20difficulty%20is%20in%20identifying%20relevant%2C%20reliable%20sources%20from%20the%20vast%20amount%20of%20publicly%20available%20information.&f=false|title=No Safe Haven: Homeland Insecurity|last=Hudnall|first=Ken|publisher=Grave Distractions Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781452493923|location=|pages=|chapter=Intelligence Failures}}</ref> However, this is not as great a challenge for those who know how to access local knowledge and how to leverage human experts who can create new tailored knowledge on the fly. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==OSINT community disciplines==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\n\n===United States===\n\n====Government====\nThere are a large number of open-source activities taking place throughout the US Government.  Frequently, these open-source activities are described as \"media monitoring\", \"media analysis\", \"internet research\" and \"public surveys\" but are open source nonetheless.\n\nThe [[Library of Congress]] sponsors the [[Federal Research Division]] (FRD) which conducts a great deal of tailored open-source research on a fee-for-service basis for the executive branch.\n\n====Intelligence====\nThe [[US Intelligence Community]]'s open-source activities (known as the [[National Open Source Enterprise]]) are dictated by Intelligence Community Directive 301 promulgated by the Director of National Intelligence.<ref>DNI Intelligence Community Directive 301 \u2013 [https://fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-301.pdf \"National Open Source Enterprise\"] 11 July 2006.</ref>  The Directive establishes the authorities and responsibilities of the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source (ADDNI/OS), the DNI's Open Source Center and the National Open Source Committee.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the National Open Source Enterprise, the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), established in 1941, was the government's primary open-source unit, transcribing and translating foreign broadcasts. It absorbed the Defense Department's [[Joint Publications Research Service]] (JPRS), which did a similar function with foreign printed materials, including newspapers, magazines, and technical journals.\n\n====Armed forces====\n\nThe former [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]], Dr. [[Stephen Cambone]] encouraged in part by the [[Defense Science Board]] reports on [[strategic communication]] and [[transition to and from hostilities]], created the Defense Open Source Program (DOSP).  The current under-secretary of defense for intelligence is assigned executive agency for this program to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].\n\nU.S. military offices that engage in OSINT activities include:\n\n*[[Unified combatant command]]\n*[[Defense Intelligence Agency]]\n*[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]\n*[[Foreign Military Studies Office|US Army Foreign Military Studies Office]]\n*[https://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/eucom/jac/ EUCOM JAC Molesworth]\n*Foreign media monitoring in support of information operations, [[U.S. Strategic Command]]\n\n====Homeland Security====\nThe [[Department of Homeland Security]] has an active open-source intelligence unit. In congressional testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee, Undersecretary of Homeland Security Charles Allen indicated on February 14, 2007, that he had established the \"Domestic Open Source Enterprise\" to support the Department's OSINT needs and that of state, local,\u039f and tribal partners.\n\n====Law enforcement====\nThe law enforcement OSINT community applies open-source intelligence (OSINT) to the [[crime prediction|prediction]], prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminals including terrorists. Additionally, [[fusion center]]s around the US are increasingly utilizing OSINT to support their intelligence generation and investigations.\n\nExamples of successful law enforcement OSINT include [[Scotland Yard]] OSINT; [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) OSINT.\n\n[[INTERPOL]] and [[EUROPOL]] experimented with OSINT units for a time, but they appear to have atrophied with the departure of their individual champions.\n\n[[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) is known to have an OSINT unit, as does the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], housed within the Emergency Operations Bureau and affiliated with the LA Joint Regional Intelligence Center.\n\n====Business====\nBusiness OSINT encompasses [[Commercial Intelligence]], [[Competitor Intelligence]], and [[Business Intelligence]], and is often a chief area of practice of [[private intelligence agency|private intelligence agencies]].\n\nBusinesses may use [[information broker]]s and [[private investigator]]s to collect and analyze relevant information for business purposes which may include the [[Mass media|media]], [[Deep Web (search indexing)|deep web]], [[web 2.0]] and commercial content.\n\n====Private specialized business====\nAnother related business group within the United States that relies upon OSINT is the commercial bail-bond industry. This related industry, servicing the court system, is apart from the above [[Business Intelligence]] sector.\nOSINT is useful to bail-bond agencies that employ a private fugitive recovery agency to locate and apprehend their absent client; i.e., a criminal defendant who has failed to appear for court and subsequently a warrant for arrest was issued. OSINT is the first method of discovery to help locate the defendant when initial interviewing of the bond co-signers, defendant's relatives and friends is lacking. OSINT gathering leads the investigator to discover an alternate hypothesis to analyze and then match relevant data for making a prediction regarding the fugitive's location; e.g., data is scrubbed from web access on Facebook entries, Twitter messages, and Snapchat.\n\nShould those methods fail, the next step is to seek the specialized behavioral intelligence services that reference OSINT to aid in establishing the veracity of subjects during the forensic interview and is used to create a behavioral profile. OSINT data is correlated with interview data to include a variety behavioral patterns; e.g., a list of daily personal contacts, habits of activities, visited places of interest, vehicles used, favorite group involvements, etc. According to the director, psychologist and forensic interviewer at MN-Behavioral Intelligence Agency, (2016) OSINT data base has to be critically filtered and analyzed before it can be applied within [[investigative interviewing]] and interrogation.\n\n=== Ukraine ===\n\n==== OSINT projects in Ukraine ====\n[https://infozahyst.com/products/spectrum/ SPECTRUM] is a technology project that delivers various OSINT solutions for government and business - based on artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data. In early 2014, various modules were developed and in 2016 the first government tender was won. At the end of 2016, the Spectrum team created the first sophisticated pipeline to process and analyze textual information in more than 50 languages.\n\n== Open Source Intelligence analysis software ==\nThere are several categories of tools intended for OSINT analysis. The first category includes open source tools to query multiple search engines simultaneously such as IntelTechniques or search engines that provide results separately such as All in One or [[DuckDuckGo]]. This category also includes social media search engines and search engines of domains and people such as Pipl.com, Whois.net, Website.informer. The second category is designed for big data analytics platforms such as DataWalk which combine OSINT insight with local, internal data for further visual analysis and to conduct link analysis to identify connections across a large volume of records.\n\n=== Tools ===\nA list of some tools used for collecting open source intelligence:\n\n* [[WHOIS|Whois]]\n* [[Nslookup]]\n* [https://www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html FOCA]\n* [https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/theharvester theHarvester]\n* [https://www.shodan.io/ Shodan]\n* [[Maltego]]\n* [https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/recon-ng Recon-ng]\n* [https://censys.io/ Censys]\n\n==See also==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ashley Feinberg]]\n*[[Co-occurrence networks]]\n*[[DARPA TIDES program]]\n*[[Doxing]]\n*[[Fusion center]]\n*[[ICWATCH]]\n*[[Intellipedia]]\n*[[Investigative Data Warehouse]]\n*[[MiTAP]]\n*[[National Intelligence Open Source Committee]]\n\n*[[NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook]], [[NATO Open Source Intelligence Reader]]\n*[[Open data]]\n*[[Open Source Center]]\n*[[Private intelligence agency]]\n*[[ROSIDS]]\n*[[Special Libraries Association]]\n*[[Strategic intelligence]]\n\n\n\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060418-110124-3694r.htm WashTimes.com], Washington Times \u2013 CIA mines 'rich' content from blogs,  19 April 2006\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081201184220/http://www.gcn.com/print/25_6/40152-1.html GCN.com], Government Computer News \u2013 Intelligence units mine the benefits of public sources 20 March 2006\n*[http://www.afcea.org/content/?q=node/1102 AFCEA.org], SIGNAL Magazine \u2013 Intelligence Center Mines Open Sources March 2006\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024429/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBS/is_4_31/ai_n16419797 FindAcricles.com], Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin October\u2013December, 2005 by Barbara G.

It is not related to [[open-source software]] or [[collective intelligence]].\n\nOSINT under one name or another has been around for hundreds of years. With the advent of instant communications and rapid information transfer, a great deal of actionable and predictive intelligence can now be obtained from public, unclassified sources.\n\n==Principles==\nOpen Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/tip/Using-open-source-intelligence-software-for-cybersecurity-intelligence|title=Using open source intelligence software for cybersecurity intelligence|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=June 2012|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> OSINT is primarily used in [[national security]], [[law enforcement]], and [[competitive intelligence|business intelligence]] functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering [[classified information|classified]], [[classified information|unclassified]], or [[trade secret|proprietary intelligence]] [[intelligence requirement|requirements]] across the previous intelligence disciplines.\n\nOSINT sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The US Intelligence Community |asin=0813349184 }}</ref>\n\n*'''Media''', print [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[radio]], and [[television]] from across and between countries.\n*'''[[Internet]]''', [[online publication]]s, [[blogs]], [[discussion group]]s, citizen media (i.e. \u2013 cell phone [[digital video|videos]], and [[user created content]]), [[YouTube]], and other [[social]] media websites (i.e. \u2013 [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram|<span lang=\"vi\">Instagram</span>]], etc.).

The Center was established to collect information available from \"the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery.\"<ref>Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \"[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm ODNI Announces Establishment of Open Source Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623072458/http://dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}\".

Specifically, [[In-Q-Tel]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] supported venture capital firm in Arlington, VA assisted companies develop web-monitoring and predictive analysis tools.\n\nIn December 2005, the Director of National Intelligence appointed [[Eliot A.

The amount of data being distributed increases at a rate that it becomes difficult to [[Words of estimative probability|evaluate sources]] in [[intelligence analysis]].\n\nAccredited journalists have some protection in asking questions, and researching for recognized media outlets. Even so, they can be imprisoned, even executed, for seeking out OSINT. Private individuals illegally collecting data for a foreign military or intelligence agency is considered [[espionage]] in most countries. Of course, espionage that is not [[treason]] (i.e. betraying one's country of citizenship) has been a tool of statecraft since ancient times.<ref>[[Sun Tzu]] ([[Warring States period]]), ''[[The Art of War]]'', Chapter 13: \"Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of 2 hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.\"</ref>\n\n==Value==\nOSINT is valuable because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation processes and timelines than more technical intelligence disciplines such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], [[Measurement and signature intelligence|MASINT]], [[Geospatial intelligence|GEOINT]], etc. Additionally, OSINT collects a valuable variety of opinions because it encompasses a great variety of sources.\n\nAccording to the [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]] report submitted in March 2005, OSINT must be included in the all-source intelligence process for the following reasons (as stated in the report):\n\n#The ever-shifting nature of intelligence needs compels the IC (Intelligence Community) to quickly and easily understand a wide range of foreign countries and cultures. \u2013 \u2026 today's threats are rapidly changing and geographically diffuse; an intelligence analyst may be forced to shift rapidly from one topic to the next. Increasingly, IC professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a country\u2014information often detailed in open sources.\n#Open-source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited, and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. A notable example relates to terrorism, where open-source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.\n#Open-source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open-source reporting. This can prove useful when policy-makers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.\n#Only open source can ''store history''. A robust open-source program can, in effect, gather data to monitor the world's cultures and how they change with time. This is difficult, if not impossible, using the ''snapshots'' provided by classified collection methods.<ref>(The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities, 378\u2013379). [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]]</ref>\n\n==Process==\nOSINT is a highly diverse form of intelligence collection and analysis. It does not have its own agency, however, units are scattered within the Department of Defense and the State Department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/Vol49no2/reexamining_the_distinction_3.htm|title=Reexamining the Distinction Between Open Information and Secrets \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> Most OSINT collectors need to take precautions while collecting information from the Internet. This can come in the form of using a [[Virtual private network|VPN]] to [[anonymize]] their identity and collect information more discreetly. This is where evaluating sources becomes important to the overall OSINT collection and analysis process. An OSINT analyst needs intelligence evaluation to determine a true process or expose a false process that would affect predicting the future. Finally, the analysts need to find use of the evaluated intelligence so that it can be incorporated into a finished classified, unclassified, or proprietary intelligence product.\n\n{{See also|Big Data}}\n[[Information collection]] in OSINT is generally a different problem from collection in other intelligence disciplines where obtaining the raw information to be analyzed may be the major difficulty, particularly if it is to be obtained from non-cooperative targets. In OSINT, the chief difficulty is in identifying relevant, reliable sources from the vast amount of publicly available information.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=R1YMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=In+OSINT,+the+chief+difficulty+is+in+identifying+relevant,+reliable+sources+from+the+vast+amount+of+publicly+available+information.#v=onepage&q=In%20OSINT%2C%20the%20chief%20difficulty%20is%20in%20identifying%20relevant%2C%20reliable%20sources%20from%20the%20vast%20amount%20of%20publicly%20available%20information.&f=false|title=No Safe Haven: Homeland Insecurity|last=Hudnall|first=Ken|publisher=Grave Distractions Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781452493923|location=|pages=|chapter=Intelligence Failures}}</ref> However, this is not as great a challenge for those who know how to access local knowledge and how to leverage human experts who can create new tailored knowledge on the fly. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==OSINT community disciplines==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\n\n===United States===\n\n====Government====\nThere are a large number of open-source activities taking place throughout the US Government.  Frequently, these open-source activities are described as \"media monitoring\", \"media analysis\", \"internet research\" and \"public surveys\" but are open source nonetheless.\n\nThe [[Library of Congress]] sponsors the [[Federal Research Division]] (FRD) which conducts a great deal of tailored open-source research on a fee-for-service basis for the executive branch.\n\n====Intelligence====\nThe [[US Intelligence Community]]'s open-source activities (known as the [[National Open Source Enterprise]]) are dictated by Intelligence Community Directive 301 promulgated by the Director of National Intelligence.<ref>DNI Intelligence Community Directive 301 \u2013 [https://fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-301.pdf \"National Open Source Enterprise\"] 11 July 2006.</ref>  The Directive establishes the authorities and responsibilities of the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source (ADDNI/OS), the DNI's Open Source Center and the National Open Source Committee.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the National Open Source Enterprise, the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), established in 1941, was the government's primary open-source unit, transcribing and translating foreign broadcasts. It absorbed the Defense Department's [[Joint Publications Research Service]] (JPRS), which did a similar function with foreign printed materials, including newspapers, magazines, and technical journals.\n\n====Armed forces====\n\nThe former [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]], Dr. [[Stephen Cambone]] encouraged in part by the [[Defense Science Board]] reports on [[strategic communication]] and [[transition to and from hostilities]], created the Defense Open Source Program (DOSP).  The current under-secretary of defense for intelligence is assigned executive agency for this program to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].\n\nU.S. military offices that engage in OSINT activities include:\n\n*[[Unified combatant command]]\n*[[Defense Intelligence Agency]]\n*[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]\n*[[Foreign Military Studies Office|US Army Foreign Military Studies Office]]\n*[https://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/eucom/jac/ EUCOM JAC Molesworth]\n*Foreign media monitoring in support of information operations, [[U.S. Strategic Command]]\n\n====Homeland Security====\nThe [[Department of Homeland Security]] has an active open-source intelligence unit. In congressional testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee, Undersecretary of Homeland Security Charles Allen indicated on February 14, 2007, that he had established the \"Domestic Open Source Enterprise\" to support the Department's OSINT needs and that of state, local,\u039f and tribal partners.\n\n====Law enforcement====\nThe law enforcement OSINT community applies open-source intelligence (OSINT) to the [[crime prediction|prediction]], prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminals including terrorists. Additionally, [[fusion center]]s around the US are increasingly utilizing OSINT to support their intelligence generation and investigations.\n\nExamples of successful law enforcement OSINT include [[Scotland Yard]] OSINT; [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) OSINT.\n\n[[INTERPOL]] and [[EUROPOL]] experimented with OSINT units for a time, but they appear to have atrophied with the departure of their individual champions.\n\n[[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) is known to have an OSINT unit, as does the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], housed within the Emergency Operations Bureau and affiliated with the LA Joint Regional Intelligence Center.\n\n====Business====\nBusiness OSINT encompasses [[Commercial Intelligence]], [[Competitor Intelligence]], and [[Business Intelligence]], and is often a chief area of practice of [[private intelligence agency|private intelligence agencies]].\n\nBusinesses may use [[information broker]]s and [[private investigator]]s to collect and analyze relevant information for business purposes which may include the [[Mass media|media]], [[Deep Web (search indexing)|deep web]], [[web 2.0]] and commercial content.\n\n====Private specialized business====\nAnother related business group within the United States that relies upon OSINT is the commercial bail-bond industry. This related industry, servicing the court system, is apart from the above [[Business Intelligence]] sector.\nOSINT is useful to bail-bond agencies that employ a private fugitive recovery agency to locate and apprehend their absent client; i.e., a criminal defendant who has failed to appear for court and subsequently a warrant for arrest was issued. OSINT is the first method of discovery to help locate the defendant when initial interviewing of the bond co-signers, defendant's relatives and friends is lacking. OSINT gathering leads the investigator to discover an alternate hypothesis to analyze and then match relevant data for making a prediction regarding the fugitive's location; e.g., data is scrubbed from web access on Facebook entries, Twitter messages, and Snapchat.\n\nShould those methods fail, the next step is to seek the specialized behavioral intelligence services that reference OSINT to aid in establishing the veracity of subjects during the forensic interview and is used to create a behavioral profile. OSINT data is correlated with interview data to include a variety behavioral patterns; e.g., a list of daily personal contacts, habits of activities, visited places of interest, vehicles used, favorite group involvements, etc. According to the director, psychologist and forensic interviewer at MN-Behavioral Intelligence Agency, (2016) OSINT data base has to be critically filtered and analyzed before it can be applied within [[investigative interviewing]] and interrogation.\n\n=== Ukraine ===\n\n==== OSINT projects in Ukraine ====\n[https://infozahyst.com/products/spectrum/ SPECTRUM] is a technology project that delivers various OSINT solutions for government and business - based on artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data. In early 2014, various modules were developed and in 2016 the first government tender was won. At the end of 2016, the Spectrum team created the first sophisticated pipeline to process and analyze textual information in more than 50 languages.\n\n== Open Source Intelligence analysis software ==\nThere are several categories of tools intended for OSINT analysis. The first category includes open source tools to query multiple search engines simultaneously such as IntelTechniques or search engines that provide results separately such as All in One or [[DuckDuckGo]]. This category also includes social media search engines and search engines of domains and people such as Pipl.com, Whois.net, Website.informer.

It follows [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] as they head off to [[Las Vegas Valley|Vegas]] using a [[teleportation|teleporting machine]], which malfunctions and creates clones of themselves. The episode, which is the seventh in the series of ''[[Road to ... (Family Guy)|Road to...]]'' episodes, originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 19, 2013, airing before the episode \"[[No Country Club for Old Men]]\". Together, the two episodes were promoted as being the season finale.\n\nFirst announced at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], the episode was written by [[Steve Callaghan]] and directed by Greg Colton. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 5.28 million homes in its original airing.

Stewie's device appears to have malfunctioned, and he believes it failed to work when it instead created a duplicate set of Brian and Stewie which was teleported to Vegas. The original Brian and Stewie then travel by plane to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance. The original Brian and Stewie arrive to find their room has been already taken. As the duplicated pair have the time of their lives, the original pair find themselves in a third-rate hotel. Trying their luck, they quickly lose all of the money they brought.\n\nThe original Brian is ready to go home but Stewie admits that he already gambled away their return tickets. Brian admits that he cannot call for help after taking money from [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]. Using money they got from a [[loan shark]], they bet on a basketball game and lose yet again. Preparing to leave, the duplicated pair sitting nearby accidentally take the empty backpack from the unlucky pair, while the original Stewie unknowingly takes the duplicated pair's backpack, which is full of money.\n\nAs the pairs go their separate ways, an enforcer for the loan shark catches up with the duplicated pair (misidentifying the clones as the originals) to get the money back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money that he and Stewie borrowed or he dies next and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the original pair worry about getting caught. Stewie suggests that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that perhaps they should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.\n\nReturning home the next day, the duplicated Brian and original Stewie bump into each other at the bus terminal. Stewie realizes that the device had made clones of themselves. After deceiving each other about how their respective friend's deaths transpired to spare each other's feelings, the unlucky Stewie, realizing that the money was the lucky Brian's, hides it away from him to stop him from getting greedy and allow himself to return Lois' stolen money back to her.

In 1083, [[Prince bishop|Bishop]] [[William de St-Calais]] expelled a number of canons from [[Durham, England|Durham]]. Some of these settled in the area and established a [[collegiate church]].<ref name=\"H094\" />  Around 1183 Bishop [[Hugh Pudsey|Pudsey]] established a [[manor house]] in the town, with a great hall being completed in 1195 on the site occupied by St Peter's Chapel today.<ref name=\"S41\"/><ref name=\"H14\">{{Harvnb |Hutchinson|2005|p=14}}</ref> Bishop [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Bek]], who preferred the town as his main residence over [[Durham Castle]] due to its proximity to hunting grounds, later converted the manor house into a castle.  The grounds of the castle were noted as being large enough to contain 16,000 men ahead of the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] in 1346.<ref name=\"H14\" />\n\nBetween 1283 and 1310, Bek was also responsible for ordering the replacement of the collegiate church established in 1183 with the Church of St Andrew that stands in South Church today,<ref name=\"H094\" /> together with accommodation for the canons; the building known today as the East Deanery.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hutchinson|2009|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe collegiate church also appears to have supported a school.  The collegiate church was re-organised under Bishop [[Thomas Langley|Langley]] in 1428 and at some point in the same century moved to the castle grounds.  The college and its school were finally dissolved in the 16th century.<ref name=\"short history\">{{citation \n |last=Laurie \n |first=Barbara \n |title=A Short History of Bishop Auckland \n |publisher=Bishop Auckland Town \n |url=http://www.bishopauckland.org/history1.asp?HistoryId=15 \n |accessdate=26 August 2008 \n |archivedate=25 July 2011\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725080535/http://www.bishopauckland.org/history1.asp?HistoryId=15\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy \n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Harvnb|Fordyce|1857|p=543}}</ref><ref name=\"Victoria\">{{citation |first=William |last=Page |series=Victoria History of the Counties of England |title=A history of the County of Durham |volume=1 |year=1905 |publisher=Constable |pages=397\u2013398}}</ref>\n\nThe school was not revived until the reign of [[James I of England|King James I]] when in 1604 Anne Swifte petitioned the King to found a school and the Free Grammar School of King James, the direct antecedent of today's King James I school, was established.

In 1083, [[Prince bishop|Bishop]] [[William de St-Calais]] expelled a number of canons from [[Durham, England|Durham]]. Some of these settled in the area and established a [[collegiate church]].<ref name=\"H094\" />  Around 1183 Bishop [[Hugh Pudsey|Pudsey]] established a [[manor house]] in the town, with a great hall being completed in 1195 on the site occupied by St Peter's Chapel today.<ref name=\"S41\"/><ref name=\"H14\">{{Harvnb |Hutchinson|2005|p=14}}</ref> Bishop [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Bek]], who preferred the town as his main residence over [[Durham Castle]] due to its proximity to hunting grounds, later converted the manor house into a castle.  The grounds of the castle were noted as being large enough to contain 16,000 men ahead of the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] in 1346.<ref name=\"H14\" />\n\nBetween 1283 and 1310, Bek was also responsible for ordering the replacement of the collegiate church established in 1183 with the Church of St Andrew that stands in South Church today,<ref name=\"H094\" /> together with accommodation for the canons; the building known today as the East Deanery.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hutchinson|2009|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe collegiate church also appears to have supported a school.  The collegiate church was re-organised under Bishop [[Thomas Langley|Langley]] in 1428 and at some point in the same century moved to the castle grounds.  The college and its school were finally dissolved in the 16th century.<ref name=\"short history\">{{citation \n |last=Laurie \n |first=Barbara \n |title=A Short History of Bishop Auckland \n |publisher=Bishop Auckland Town \n |url=http://www.bishopauckland.org/history1.asp?HistoryId=15 \n |accessdate=26 August 2008 \n |archivedate=25 July 2011\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725080535/http://www.bishopauckland.org/history1.asp?HistoryId=15\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy \n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{Harvnb|Fordyce|1857|p=543}}</ref><ref name=\"Victoria\">{{citation |first=William |last=Page |series=Victoria History of the Counties of England |title=A history of the County of Durham |volume=1 |year=1905 |publisher=Constable |pages=397\u2013398}}</ref>\n\nThe school was not revived until the reign of [[James I of England|King James I]] when in 1604 Anne Swifte petitioned the King to found a school and the Free Grammar School of King James, the direct antecedent of today's King James I school, was established.

While he made songs for his peers, he made albums for himself such as ''Naaalala Ka'', ''Rey Valera Vol. 2'', ''Walang Kapalit'', ''Hello'', ''The Rey Valera Christmas Album'', ''Gabay Mo Ako'', ''Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 1'', ''Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 2'', ''Pirapirasong Ala-ala'', ''Sa Kabila Ng Lahat'', ''Kung Sakaling Iibig Muli'', ''FM Ka, AM Ako'', ''Home Sweet Home'', ''Ang Mahalaga'', etc. Most of these albums made golds and platinums.\n\nRecently, Vicor Music Corporation compiled Valera's recorded songs in their library in a 4-disc album entitled, ''Walang Kapalit'', as part of Vicor's 40th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/12/12/ENTR2004121224274.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022093456/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/12/12/ENTR2004121224274.html |archivedate=October 22, 2007 |title=\"Vicor celebrates 40 years of commitment to the Filipino artist\" December 12, 2004 |publisher=MB.com.ph |date=October 22, 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nHe was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame in 2009.\n\nHe won the MYX Magna Award 2015 in the recent 2015 MYX Music Awards.<ref name=\"myxmagna\">{{Cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/22973/here-are-the-winners-of-the-myxmusicawards-2015/ |title=Here Are The Winners Of The #MYXMusicAwards 2015! |publisher=[[Myx]] |date=27 March 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Mr. DJ and Sharon Cuneta ===\nOne of his initial projects as a request from [[Tito Sotto]] who was the vice president of the Vicor Music Corporation at that time was to make a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, and a bit too old to be given a nursery rhyme.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Pansin ko fleeting ang life, atsaka moment ka lang in time.\n\nKaya ma-swerte na lang ako meron akong konting laban sa time...\n\nHindi niya ako mabubura...

Wherever radio station the song would be submitted in, it was almost always guaranteed that it would be played as it was their song. The song, Mr. DJ,made remarkable sales on the chart.\n\nSharon stated in a recent interview by Deborah Kan in Star News Asia, that she has been always thankful for and grateful to Rey, for writing her first hit song. \"Mr. DJ\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startv.com/starnewsasia/view/talk/4028d8bb124b05e70112642178ad0024 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012021/http://www.startv.com/starnewsasia/view/talk/4028d8bb124b05e70112642178ad0024 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=Star News Asia, \"Talk with Deborah Kan\" |publisher=Startv.com |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe two have been friends ever since, and in 1992, Sharon paid tribute to her favorite composer when she recorded Sharon Sings Valera.<ref name=\"globalpinoy.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Rey%20Valera&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 |title=Pinoy Musicians, Rey Valera |publisher=Globalpinoy.com |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025622/http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Rey%20Valera&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Sharon Cuneta and her then husband Gabby Concepcion separated, Rey composed the song, \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\" (Even When You're Gone). When Sharon and Rey met at Cinema Audio, she asked why he was not writing songs for her anymore. Rey replied that he did write  one for her and submitted the song to VIVA for it to be an inspiration or a battleground for Sharon. Both of them found out that the song has been shelved for two years at VIVA. Sharon immediately recorded the song and used it in her movie, \"Single Mother\"(former title). It was retitled to \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\".<ref name=\"globalpinoy.com\"/>\n\nSharon's biggest blockbuster movies were lifted from popular songs of Rey, thus Sharon singing Valera has been an always-winning chemistry.\n\n=== Rey Valera's impostor ===\nIn 1983, Rey faced one of the worst challenges of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/fake-valera.jpg |title=People's Journal January 26, 1983 \"Fake Valera Alive & Kicking\" |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024623/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/fake-valera.jpg |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"webng1983\">{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/reybolero.jpg |title=Artista Magazine February 12, 1983 \"Will The Real Rey Valera Please Stand Up?\" |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024737/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/reybolero.jpg |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like \"borrowing\" money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name.<ref name=\"webng1983\"/> Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, \"My Fans Are in Trouble\" to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/my-fans-are-in-trouble.jpg |title=Tik-a-tik Newspaper/Magazine March 3, 1983 \"Help Me, My Fans Are in Trouble... \u2013 Rey Valera\" |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024809/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/my-fans-are-in-trouble.jpg |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might do to him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business at the peak of his career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.\n\nRey now talks about the impostor topic on less serious, even humorous tone, to help forget the traumatic experience it had caused. Looking back, he even dubbed his impostor \"Rey Bolero\" ( Rey the Deceiver / Smooth Talker ) when he talks about it to his friends and interviews, which was also mentioned on the \"Na-Scam Ka Na Ba\"  interview on the Filipino television channel QTV11 which aired around September 2006.\n\n==== Bubble Gang parody ====\nIn May 2008, a friendlier, funnier impostor had emerged on the Filipino television show [[Bubble Gang]], in the persona of comedian/[[parodist]] [[Michael V.]] He even used \"Rey Bolero\" as his screen name. A segment of the show featured Michael V. as Rey Bolero, singing Mas Tanga 'ko Sa'yo ( I'm Dumber Than You Are ) \u2013 A parody of one of Rey Valera's well known songs, Pangako Sa'yo ( I Promise To You ). His costume was even patterned after Rey Valera's late 1970s attire.\n\nThe idea proved to be a hit, and a second Rey Valera song was soon used on the same show and segment, also by Michael V. himself. The song, \"Kung Kailangan Mo Ako\" ( If You Need Me ), was parodied into Kung Kailangan Mo Bato ( If You Need A Stone / To Get Stoned\u2014a slang use of the word \"stone\", as in [[Methamphetamine|illegal substance]] / [[Substance intoxication|getting high]] )\n\nOn October 31 of the same year, Rey Valera, and Michael V. as Rey Bolero ( now mimicking Rey Valera's clothes and hairstyle at the time) performed a duet and was one of the highlights of the heavily promoted, \"taped as live\", two-part Bubble Gang 13th Anniversary special. A narration was heard before the two artists entered the stage; \"Do the singers that Michael V. impersonate ever get angry?\" \u2013 (translated from Tagalog). They sang a medley of the two previously mentioned parodied songs. The segment ended with Rey Valera mock-swinging his guitar at Michael V., and the former mock-chasing the latter towards the backstage.\n\n=== Theme songs for soap operas ===\nValera 's songs are also favorite titles and theme songs of soap operas like ''Ula, Batang Gubat'' (\"Malayo Pa Ang Umaga\"), ''[[Sa Sandaling Kailangan Mo Ako]]'' (\"Kung Kailangan Mo Ako\"), ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'' (\"Pangako\"), from [[ABS-CBN]].\n\nRecently, Valera's song's have been revived as theme songs for soap operas. They are: [[Maging Sino Ka Man]] (which has spawned a second book, [[Maging Sino Ka Man: Ang Pagbabalik]]), [[Walang Kapalit]], [[Tayong Dalawa]] and [[Juan dela Cruz (TV series)|Juan Dela Cruz]] from [[ABS-CBN]]. All of these [[ABS-CBN]] shows have turned into a massive hit, making them top-rating and be part of every Filipino's lives .\n\n=== Writing music and songs for movies ===\nRey was film scoring movies during his singing career, but after the trouble his impostor has caused, Rey focused on his musical directing career. He particularly liked scoring music for action films, giving fight scenes and chase sequences fast paced, rock-themed music, which reflects his roots as a rock band member.\n\nRey's songs made marks also as theme songs and movie titles. These include several [[Sharon Cuneta]] movies such as ''Maging Sino Ka Man'', ''Pangako sa 'Yo'', ''Kahit Wala Ka Na'', ''Tayong Dalawa''; ''Sinasamba Kita'', ''Romansa'', ''Hiwalay''; ''Carnap King'', ''Barumbado'', and ''Baby Ama''; ''Pasong Tirad, The Gregorio del Pilar Story'', ''Tampisaw''.\n\nThere are very few people are aware that Rey wrote music for movies, even fewer are aware that he also wrote music for [[Motion picture rating system#Philippines|R-18]] \"Bold\" films.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350188/fullcredits imdb.com, \"Tampisaw\" Original Music by Rey Valera]</ref> He accepted making music for movies and considered it an opportunity, as these projects usually pitted his songwriting skills to follow fresh and often unusual themes and topics, often deviating from pop love songs which he was usually typecast into.\n\nThe theme song \"Ambon\" (Raindrop) from the film ''Tampisaw'' emphasizes on the singer's hunger and deprivation of love, and that a single \"raindrop\" of love would be enough for her to live on.\n\nThe theme song \"Nagpapanggap\" (Pretending/Deceiving) from the film ''Kerida'' (''The Mistress'') depicts a person's awareness that her lover is only pretending to love her, and yet she has this pragmatic acceptance and is even thankful that she was loved, no matter how false that love may be.\n\nThe theme song \"Sa Gitna ng Buhay Ko\" (In The Middle of My Life) from the film ''Naglalayag'' (''Silent Passage'') follows the movie's theme of a middle-aged woman falling in love with a man half her age. The song relates to her life as the times of the day, asking questions such as, \"why did love arrive at only NOON?\"\n\n=== The Greatest Hitmakers ===\nIn 2002, Rey reunited with his contemporaries [[Rico J. Puno]] and [[Hajji Alejandro]] in a series of concerts called \"Greatest Hits\", highlighting the music of their own time. They also launched a [[video CD|VCD]] recording of their concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kabayancentral.com/video/viva/cppvatghslatmm.html |title=The Greatest Hits Live (Rico-Rey-Hajji) |publisher=Kabayancentral.com |date=December 28, 1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> [[Nonoy Zu\u00f1iga]] and [[Marco Sison]] joined the group in the following year.

The group has successfully performed even with the absence of one or two members, usually concentrating on a core trio group ( e.g. Rey, Hajji, Rico / Rey, Hajji, Marco / Rey, Rico, Marco ) and varies between concert to concert, depending on each member's availability. This flexibility of the group's roster combined with miscommunication with the each show's promoter and other reasons has often led to various names for the group such as \"The Hitmakers\", \"The Greatest Hits\", \"The Great Hitmakers\" \"GH5\", \"GH4\" and such.\n\n=== Saling Ket ===\nIn July 2005, Rey Valera released the music album \"Panghabangbuhay\", with his children's band called \"Saling Ket\".

[[Filipinos|Filipino]] singer, songwriter, music director, film scorer and television host. He wrote and produced songs that were recorded by various singers, most notably [[Sharon Cuneta]]. He is currently the head judge of the singing contest segment \"[[Tawag ng Tanghalan]]\" in a variety noontime show [[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]. He is the Cousin of Former Abra Governor Vicente P. Valera.\n\n== Career ==\nRey Valera started his recording career in 1977 after becoming a band member from a group called [[Electric Hair Band]] for seven years. He waxed his first single as a solo singer \u2013 songwriter with the song \"Ako si Superman\", which he wrote supposedly for [[Rico Puno]].  His former boss at [[Vicor Records]] gave him the opportunity to sing his song and at the same time hired him as one of Vicor's in-house producers. Valera wrote the song \"Mr. D.J.\" and \"Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko\" for Sharon Cuneta as part of the album ''DJ's Pet'', released in 1978.\n\nRey also made songs for other artists such as Rico Puno's \"Sorry Na, Pwede Ba\", \"Daigdig Ng Ala-ala\"; Geraldine's \"Pangako\"; Pol Enriquez' \"Ayoko na Sa 'Yo\" and many more. While he made songs for his peers, he made albums for himself such as ''Naaalala Ka'', ''Rey Valera Vol. 2'', ''Walang Kapalit'', ''Hello'', ''The Rey Valera Christmas Album'', ''Gabay Mo Ako'', ''Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 1'', ''Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 2'', ''Pirapirasong Ala-ala'', ''Sa Kabila Ng Lahat'', ''Kung Sakaling Iibig Muli'', ''FM Ka, AM Ako'', ''Home Sweet Home'', ''Ang Mahalaga'', etc. Most of these albums made golds and platinums.\n\nRecently, Vicor Music Corporation compiled Valera's recorded songs in their library in a 4-disc album entitled, ''Walang Kapalit'', as part of Vicor's 40th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/12/12/ENTR2004121224274.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022093456/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/12/12/ENTR2004121224274.html |archivedate=October 22, 2007 |title=\"Vicor celebrates 40 years of commitment to the Filipino artist\" December 12, 2004 |publisher=MB.com.ph |date=October 22, 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nHe was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame in 2009.\n\nHe won the MYX Magna Award 2015 in the recent 2015 MYX Music Awards.<ref name=\"myxmagna\">{{Cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/22973/here-are-the-winners-of-the-myxmusicawards-2015/ |title=Here Are The Winners Of The #MYXMusicAwards 2015! |publisher=[[Myx]] |date=27 March 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Mr. DJ and Sharon Cuneta ===\nOne of his initial projects as a request from [[Tito Sotto]] who was the vice president of the Vicor Music Corporation at that time was to make a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, and a bit too old to be given a nursery rhyme.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Pansin ko fleeting ang life, atsaka moment ka lang in time.\n\nKaya ma-swerte na lang ako meron akong konting laban sa time...\n\nHindi niya ako mabubura...

Wherever radio station the song would be submitted in, it was almost always guaranteed that it would be played as it was their song. The song, Mr. DJ,made remarkable sales on the chart.\n\nSharon stated in a recent interview by Deborah Kan in Star News Asia, that she has been always thankful for and grateful to Rey, for writing her first hit song. \"Mr. DJ\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startv.com/starnewsasia/view/talk/4028d8bb124b05e70112642178ad0024 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012021/http://www.startv.com/starnewsasia/view/talk/4028d8bb124b05e70112642178ad0024 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=Star News Asia, \"Talk with Deborah Kan\" |publisher=Startv.com |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe two have been friends ever since, and in 1992, Sharon paid tribute to her favorite composer when she recorded Sharon Sings Valera.<ref name=\"globalpinoy.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Rey%20Valera&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 |title=Pinoy Musicians, Rey Valera |publisher=Globalpinoy.com |accessdate=2012-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025622/http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Rey%20Valera&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Sharon Cuneta and her then husband Gabby Concepcion separated, Rey composed the song, \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\" (Even When You're Gone). When Sharon and Rey met at Cinema Audio, she asked why he was not writing songs for her anymore. Rey replied that he did write  one for her and submitted the song to VIVA for it to be an inspiration or a battleground for Sharon. Both of them found out that the song has been shelved for two years at VIVA. Sharon immediately recorded the song and used it in her movie, \"Single Mother\"(former title). It was retitled to \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\".<ref name=\"globalpinoy.com\"/>\n\nSharon's biggest blockbuster movies were lifted from popular songs of Rey, thus Sharon singing Valera has been an always-winning chemistry.\n\n=== Rey Valera's impostor ===\nIn 1983, Rey faced one of the worst challenges of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/fake-valera.jpg |title=People's Journal January 26, 1983 \"Fake Valera Alive & Kicking\" |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024623/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/fake-valera.jpg |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"webng1983\">{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/reybolero.jpg |title=Artista Magazine February 12, 1983 \"Will The Real Rey Valera Please Stand Up?\" |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024737/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/reybolero.jpg |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like \"borrowing\" money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name.<ref name=\"webng1983\"/> Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, \"My Fans Are in Trouble\" to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/my-fans-are-in-trouble.jpg |title=Tik-a-tik Newspaper/Magazine March 3, 1983 \"Help Me, My Fans Are in Trouble... \u2013 Rey Valera\" |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024809/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/my-fans-are-in-trouble.jpg |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might do to him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business at the peak of his career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.\n\nRey now talks about the impostor topic on less serious, even humorous tone, to help forget the traumatic experience it had caused. Looking back, he even dubbed his impostor \"Rey Bolero\" ( Rey the Deceiver / Smooth Talker ) when he talks about it to his friends and interviews, which was also mentioned on the \"Na-Scam Ka Na Ba\"  interview on the Filipino television channel QTV11 which aired around September 2006.\n\n==== Bubble Gang parody ====\nOn May 2008, a friendlier, funnier impostor had emerged on the Filipino television show [[Bubble Gang]], in the persona of comedian/[[parodist]] [[Michael V.]] He even used \"Rey Bolero\" as his screen name. A segment of the show featured Michael V. as Rey Bolero, singing Mas Tanga 'ko Sa'yo ( I'm Dumber Than You Are ) \u2013 A parody of one of Rey Valera's well known songs, Pangako Sa'yo ( I Promise To You ). His costume was even patterned after Rey Valera's late 1970s attire.\n\nThe idea proved to be a hit, and a second Rey Valera song was soon used on the same show and segment, also by Michael V. himself. The song, \"Kung Kailangan Mo Ako\" ( If You Need Me ), was parodied into Kung Kailangan Mo Bato ( If You Need A Stone / To Get Stoned\u2014a slang use of the word \"stone\", as in [[Methamphetamine|illegal substance]] / [[Substance intoxication|getting high]] )\n\nOn October 31 of the same year, Rey Valera, and Michael V. as Rey Bolero ( now mimicking Rey Valera's clothes and hairstyle at the time) performed a duet and was one of the highlights of the heavily promoted, \"taped as live\", two-part Bubble Gang 13th Anniversary special. A narration was heard before the two artists entered the stage; \"Do the singers that Michael V. impersonate ever get angry?\" \u2013 (translated from Tagalog). They sang a medley of the two previously mentioned parodied songs. The segment ended with Rey Valera mock-swinging his guitar at Michael V., and the former mock-chasing the latter towards the backstage.\n\n=== Theme songs for soap operas ===\nValera 's songs are also favorite titles and theme songs of soap operas like ''Ula, Batang Gubat'' (\"Malayo Pa Ang Umaga\"), ''[[Sa Sandaling Kailangan Mo Ako]]'' (\"Kung Kailangan Mo Ako\"), ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'' (\"Pangako\"), from [[ABS-CBN]].\n\nRecently, Valera's song's have been revived as theme songs for soap operas. They are: [[Maging Sino Ka Man]] (which has spawned a second book, [[Maging Sino Ka Man: Ang Pagbabalik]]), [[Walang Kapalit]], [[Tayong Dalawa]] and [[Juan dela Cruz (TV series)|Juan Dela Cruz]] from [[ABS-CBN]]. All of these [[ABS-CBN]] shows have turned into a massive hit, making them top-rating and be part of every Filipino's lives .\n\n=== Writing music and songs for movies ===\nRey was film scoring movies during his singing career, but after the trouble his impostor has caused, Rey focused on his musical directing career. He particularly liked scoring music for action films, giving fight scenes and chase sequences fast paced, rock-themed music, which reflects his roots as a rock band member.\n\nRey's songs made marks also as theme songs and movie titles. These include several [[Sharon Cuneta]] movies such as ''Maging Sino Ka Man'', ''Pangako sa 'Yo'', ''Kahit Wala Ka Na'', ''Tayong Dalawa''; ''Sinasamba Kita'', ''Romansa'', ''Hiwalay''; ''Carnap King'', ''Barumbado'', and ''Baby Ama''; ''Pasong Tirad, The Gregorio del Pilar Story'', ''Tampisaw''.\n\nThere are very few people are aware that Rey wrote music for movies, even fewer are aware that he also wrote music for [[Motion picture rating system#Philippines|R-18]] \"Bold\" films.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350188/fullcredits imdb.com, \"Tampisaw\" Original Music by Rey Valera]</ref> He accepted making music for movies and considered it an opportunity, as these projects usually pitted his songwriting skills to follow fresh and often unusual themes and topics, often deviating from pop love songs which he was usually typecast into.\n\nThe theme song \"Ambon\" (Raindrop) from the film ''Tampisaw'' emphasizes on the singer's hunger and deprivation of love, and that a single \"raindrop\" of love would be enough for her to live on.\n\nThe theme song \"Nagpapanggap\" (Pretending/Deceiving) from the film ''Kerida'' (''The Mistress'') depicts a person's awareness that her lover is only pretending to love her, and yet she has this pragmatic acceptance and is even thankful that she was loved, no matter how false that love may be.\n\nThe theme song \"Sa Gitna ng Buhay Ko\" (In The Middle of My Life) from the film ''Naglalayag'' (''Silent Passage'') follows the movie's theme of a middle-aged woman falling in love with a man half her age. The song relates to her life as the times of the day, asking questions such as, \"why did love arrive at only NOON?\"\n\n=== The Greatest Hitmakers ===\nIn 2002, Rey reunited with his contemporaries [[Rico J. Puno]] and [[Hajji Alejandro]] in a series of concerts called \"Greatest Hits\", highlighting the music of their own time. They also launched a [[video CD|VCD]] recording of their concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kabayancentral.com/video/viva/cppvatghslatmm.html |title=The Greatest Hits Live (Rico-Rey-Hajji) |publisher=Kabayancentral.com |date=December 28, 1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> [[Nonoy Zu\u00f1iga]] and [[Marco Sison]] joined the group in the following year.

The group has successfully performed even with the absence of one or two members, usually concentrating on a core trio group ( e.g. Rey, Hajji, Rico / Rey, Hajji, Marco / Rey, Rico, Marco ) and varies between concert to concert, depending on each member's availability. This flexibility of the group's roster combined with miscommunication with the each show's promoter and other reasons has often led to various names for the group such as \"The Hitmakers\", \"The Greatest Hits\", \"The Great Hitmakers\" \"GH5\", \"GH4\" and such.\n\n=== Saling Ket ===\nIn July 2005, Rey Valera released the music album \"Panghabangbuhay\", with his children's band called \"Saling Ket\".
