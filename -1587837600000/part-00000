It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him.

He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features prominent piano by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)''.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him.

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

Few could have imagined the effect it would have on Colombian history. After the battle, the war took a 180-degree-turn, and became one of the most brutal conflicts in early 20th century South America.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the victory of Peralonso (December 15, 1899), the Liberals could have finished the war, completing the Conservative defeat by marching unopposed on the capital. General Vargas Santos,  commander of a Liberal army, believed it was dishonorable to attack the dispersed government army, and ordered that his troops move to C\u00facuta, many kilometers from the site of the battle.\n\nWhen finally in February, fighting off mosquitoes and fever, the General decided to begin small skirmishes, a new Conservative army, fresh and well supplied, under the command of the general Pr\u00f3spero Pinz\u00f3n, had cut off all routes of escape.\n\n==In the darkness==\nOn May 11, 1900, the Liberal advance arrived at the outposts in the Canta mountains, in between [[Bucaramanga]] and Lebrija, and there began the most prolonged battle of the war. Fifteen days of combat on a front of 26 kilometers of trenches occurred in the rustic topography of the hills of Palonegro. There, the victory swung with every meter lost or gained, and where [[machete]]s and [[yatagan]]es created a slaughter between both sides.\n\nThe burning sun overhead, the suffocating heat, the lack of equipment, the deficiency of efficient \"ambulances\" and the canteens full of a mixture of brandy with powder all combined with the brutality of a combat where the cutting weapon amputated members and cleaved flesh, condemning its victims to a slow death between the ditches. Long before the end of the battle, the stench of the dead, who shared the trenches with the living, poisoned the air of the region, and darkened the sky with carrion birds, many became anchored to earth because the weight of their banquets was greater than the force of their wings.\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:2-palonegro-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Soldiers during the battle of Palonegro]] -->\n\nAfter the battle, the doctors who took care of the wounded and buried the dead told chilling stories of the brutal viciousness of the battle. Dead fathers lying next to their deceased adolescent sons, inhabitants of the region looting the corpses of the dead, thousands of corpses covered with flies that laid eggs and ate to multiply their species. They told of women gathering, like in a puzzle, the pieces of their relatives to bury them complete, or those who tried to imagine, between the bodies disfigured by the swelling, some characteristic that identified them with their loved ones.\n\nMany sources put the dead at 2,500(1,500 Liberals and 1,000 Conservatives). This is the result of the battle that reached its end on May 26 when the Liberals began to abandon their positions in order to retreat.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOf all the routes of escape, general Vargas Santos opted for the least expected: the jungle of Teorama. There the Liberals left the fury and the fever that it had when it defeated the Conservative army at the battle of Peralonso.\n\nThat day, May 26, 1900, the situation deteriorated even further. The future of the war had been sealed, the defeat of the Liberals was only a matter of time.
