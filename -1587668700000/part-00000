He was adopted by an Australian couple and, 25 years later, reunited with his biological mother after finding his hometown via [[Google Earth]]. His story generated significant international media attention, especially in Australia and India.\n\nAn autobiographical account of his experiences, ''A Long Way Home'', was published in 2013 in Australia, released internationally in 2014, and adapted into the 2016 film ''[[Lion (2016 film)|Lion]]'', starring [[Sunny Pawar]] and [[Dev Patel]] as Saroo, and [[Nicole Kidman]] as his adoptive mother, Sue Brierley.\n\n==Background==\nSaroo Brierley was born '''Sheru Munshi Khan'''<ref name=toa2017>{{cite web\n |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/saroo-brierley-i-lived-in-a-multicultural-atmosphere-but-never-faced-racism-in-australia/articleshow/57146476.cms\n |title=Saroo Brierley: I lived in a multicultural atmosphere, but never faced racism in Australia\n |accessdate=24 April 2017\n |last=Aroral\n |first=Chandna\n |date=15 February 2017\n |publisher= [[BBC]]\n }}</ref> in Ganesh Talai, a suburb within [[Khandwa]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]. When he was young, his father left his mother, throwing the family into poverty. His mother worked in construction to support herself and her children but often did not make enough money to feed them all, and could not afford to send them to school. At age five, Saroo and his older brothers, Guddu and Kallu, began begging at the railway station for food and money. Guddu sometimes obtained work sweeping the floors of train carriages.<ref name=SB>Brierley, Saroo (2013) ''A Long Way Home''. Viking.

Saroo asked his older brother if he could go, too. Guddu reluctantly agreed. By the time the train reached Burhanpur, Saroo was so tired he collapsed onto a seat on the platform. Guddu told his little brother to wait and promised to be back shortly.\n\nGuddu did not return, and Saroo eventually became impatient. He noticed a train parked in the station and, thinking his brother was on it, boarded an empty carriage. He found there were no doors to the adjoining carriages. Hoping his brother would come for him, he fell asleep. When he awoke, the train was travelling across an unfamiliar area. Occasionally the train stopped at small stations, but Saroo was unable to open the door to escape. Saroo's rail journey eventually ended at the huge [[Howrah railway station]] in Calcutta (now known as [[Kolkata]]), and he fled when someone opened the door to his carriage. Saroo did not know it at the time, but he was nearly {{convert|1500|km}} from his hometown.<ref name=SB/><ref name=BBC/> On the same night as his separation from his brother, unbeknownst to Saroo, Guddu was hit and killed by an oncoming train.\n\nSaroo attempted to return home by boarding different trains, but they proved to be suburban trains and each one eventually took him back to Howrah railway station. For a week or two, he lived on and around Howrah railway station. He survived by scavenging scraps of food in the street and sleeping underneath the station's seats. Eventually, he ventured out into the city; and, after days of homelessness on Calcutta's streets, he was found by a railway worker who took him in and gave him food and shelter. But Saroo fled when the railway worker showed Saroo to a friend and Saroo sensed that something was not right. The two men chased after him, but he managed to escape.<ref name=SB/><ref name=BBC/>\n\nSaroo eventually met a teenager who took him to a police station and reported that he might be a lost child. The police took Saroo to a government centre for abandoned children. Weeks later, he was moved to the Indian Society for Sponsorship and Adoption. The staff there attempted to locate his family. But Saroo did not know enough for them to sufficiently trace his hometown, and he was officially declared a lost child. He was subsequently adopted by the Brierley family of [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]].<ref name=SB/>\n\nIn the meantime, his mother, Kamla Munshi, searched for her two sons. A few weeks after her sons failed to return home, police informed her that Guddu's body had been found near the railway tracks, having been killed by an oncoming train a kilometre (0.6&nbsp;mi) from Burhanpur station.<ref name=BBC/> She then confined her energy to looking for Saroo, travelling to different places on trains.<ref name=SB/>\n\n==Search for his family==\nSaroo grew up in Hobart in an Australian family. His Australian parents adopted another Indian boy, Mantosh. Saroo learned [[English language|English]] and soon forgot [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. ''Saroo'' originated as a mispronunciation of his given name, Sheru.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6506884/bio</ref>\n\nHe studied business and hospitality at the [[Australian International Hotel School]] in [[Canberra]].<ref name=SB/> As an adult, he spent many hours over many months conducting searches using the satellite images on [[Google Earth]], painstakingly following railway lines radiating out from Howrah railway station. He relied on his vague memories of the main features around [[Burhanpur railway station]], although he knew little of the name of the station except that it began with the letter B.<ref name=BBC/> Late one night in 2011, he came upon a small railway station that closely matched his childhood recollection of where he had become trapped in an empty carriage; the name of this station was Burhanpur, very close to a phonetic spelling of the name he remembered from his childhood ordeal. He followed the satellite images of the railway line north and found the town of Khandwa. He had no recollection of that name, but the town contained recognizable features, such as a fountain near the train tracks where he used to play. He was able to trace a path through the streets to what appeared to be the place where he and his family used to live.<ref name=SB/><ref name=BBC/>\n\nFollowing up on a lead, Saroo contacted a [[Facebook]] group based in Khandwa. The Facebook group reinforced his belief that Khandwa might be his hometown.<ref name=SB/>\n\nIn 2012, Saroo travelled to Khandwa in India and asked residents if they knew of any family that had lost their son 25 years ago. He showed photographs of himself as a child in Hobart. Local people soon led him to his mother. He was also reunited with his sister, Shekila, and his surviving brother, Kallu, who were now a schoolteacher and factory manager, respectively. With Saroo and Guddu gone, their mother had been able to afford to send the other two to school. The reunion was extensively covered by Indian and international media.<ref name=SB/><ref name=BBC/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nSaroo continues to live in Hobart.

When he was young, his father left his mother, throwing the family into poverty. His mother worked in construction to support herself and her children but often did not make enough money to feed them all, and could not afford to send them to school. At age five, Saroo and his older brothers, Guddu and Kallu, began begging at the railway station for food and money. Guddu sometimes obtained work sweeping the floors of train carriages.<ref name=SB>Brierley, Saroo (2013) ''A Long Way Home''. Viking.

Saroo asked his older brother if he could go, too. Guddu reluctantly agreed. By the time the train reached Burhanpur, Saroo was so tired he collapsed onto a seat on the platform. Guddu told his little brother to wait and promised to be back shortly.\n\nGuddu did not return, and Saroo eventually became impatient. He noticed a train parked in the station and, thinking his brother was on it, boarded an empty carriage. He found there were no doors to the adjoining carriages. Hoping his brother would come for him, he fell asleep. When he awoke, the train was travelling across an unfamiliar area. Occasionally the train stopped at small stations, but Saroo was unable to open the door to escape. Saroo's rail journey eventually ended at the huge [[Howrah railway station]] in Calcutta (now known as [[Kolkata]]), and he fled when someone opened the door to his carriage. Saroo did not know it at the time, but he was nearly {{convert|1500|km}} from his hometown.<ref name=SB/><ref name=BBC/> On the same night as his separation from his brother, unbeknownst to Saroo, Guddu was hit and killed by an oncoming train.\n\nSaroo attempted to return home by boarding different trains, but they proved to be suburban trains and each one eventually took him back to Howrah railway station. For a week or two, he lived on and around Howrah railway station. He survived by scavenging scraps of food in the street and sleeping underneath the station's seats. Eventually, he ventured out into the city; and, after days of homelessness on Calcutta's streets, he was found by a railway worker who took him in and gave him food and shelter. But Saroo fled when the railway worker showed Saroo to a friend and Saroo sensed that something was not right. The two men chased after him, but he managed to escape.<ref name=SB/><ref name=BBC/>\n\nSaroo eventually met a teenager who took him to a police station and reported that he might be a lost child. The police took Saroo to a government centre for abandoned children. Weeks later, he was moved to the Indian Society for Sponsorship and Adoption. The staff there attempted to locate his family. But Saroo did not know enough for them to sufficiently trace his hometown, and he was officially declared a lost child.

The bright and cheerful Emma always aces the regular exams with her two best friends, Ray and Norman. The orphans are allowed complete freedom, except to venture beyond the grounds or the gate, which connects the house to the outside world.\n\nOne night, an orphan named Conny is sent away to be adopted, but Emma and Norman followed her after noticing that she left her stuffed toy, Little Bunny, back at the house.

It has been represented in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] since 1979.\n\nFor a long time this riding was considered a Liberal stronghold, having been won by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in all but one election since 1980. Longtime Liberal MP [[Jim Peterson]] was the riding's MP from 1980 to 1984 and from 1988 to 2007, and [[Martha Hall Findlay]] was the riding MP from 2008 to 2011. Long considered a safe Liberal seat, Conservative candidate [[Chungsen Leung]] won by 932 votes on the May 2, 2011 federal election. In the 2015 federal election, the seat returned to the Liberal Party with [[Ali Ehsassi]] unseating Leung. This district is home to some landmarks like [[Mel Lastman Square]], the [[Toronto Centre for the Arts]] and the [[Claude Watson School for the Arts]].\n\n==Geography==\nConsisting of that part of the City of Toronto described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the northerly limit of said city with Bayview Avenue; thence southerly along said avenue to Highway No. 401; thence generally southwesterly along said highway to the Don River West Branch; thence generally northwesterly along said branch to Bathurst Street; thence northerly along said street to the northerly limit of said city; thence easterly along said limit to the point of commencement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elections.ca/res/cir/maps2/mapprov.asp?map=35115&lang=e | title=Willowdale - Maps Corner - Elections Canada Online | publisher=Elections Canada | accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe riding contains the neighbourhoods of [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]], [[Lansing, Toronto|Lansing]], [[Newtonbrook]] and [[North York Centre]].\n\n==Demographics==\n:''According to the [[Canada 2011 Census]]; 2013 representation<ref>http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FED2013&Code1=35115&Data=Count&SearchText=Willowdale&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1</ref><ref>http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FED2013&Code1=35115&Data=Count&SearchText=Willowdale&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1#tabs2</ref>''\n\n'''Languages:''' 35.7% English, 19.1% Chinese, 9.8% Persian, 9.2% Korean, 5.8% Russian, 2.6% Tagalog, 1.7% Italian, 1.6% Spanish, 1.3% French, 1.2% Arabic<br />'''Religions:''' 46.0% Christian (20.6% Catholic, 4.3% Christian Orthodox, 3.2% Presbyterian, 2.4% United Church, 2.4% Anglican, 1.8% Baptist, 6.5% Pentecostal, 11.3% Other), 11.6% Muslim, 6.6% Jewish, 2.9% Buddhist, 1.8% Hindu, 30.4% No religion <br />'''Median income (2010):''' $26,200 <br />'''Average income (2010):''' $42,045\n\nAs per the 2016 Census, Willowdale has highest percentage of ethnic Iranians (12.1%) and ethnic Koreans (10.6%) of all City of Toronto ridings, and is one of the only four ridings with Chinese being the most frequent ethnic origin. At the same vein, it is the City of Toronto riding with the highest percentage of people belonging to the West Asian (10.9%) and Korean (10.3%) visible minorities.\n\n'''Ethnicity groups:''' White: 33.1%, Chinese: 25.3%, West Asian: 10.9%, Korean: 10.3%, South Asian: 5.9%, Filipino: 5.4%\n\n'''Ethnic origins:''' Chinese 25.9%, Iranian 12.1%, Korean 10.6%, English 6.4%, Filipino 5.8%, Canadian 5.6%, Russian 5.2%\n\n==History==\nThe riding was created in 1976 from part of [[Eglinton (electoral district)|Eglinton]], [[York North]] and [[York Centre]].\n\nWillowdale consisted initially of the part of the Borough of [[North York]] bounded on the north by the borough limit (Steeles Avenue), on the West by the West Branch of the Don River and Bathurst Street, on the south by Highway 401, and on the east by Bayview Avenue.\n\nIn 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north by the borough limits (Steeles Avenue), and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the borough limit southeast along the Don River West Branch, south along Bayview Avenue, east along Finch Avenue East, south along the Don River East Branch, west along Highway 401, and northwest along the Don River West Branch to the borough limit.\n\nIn 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north by the borough limits (Steeles Avenue), and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the borough limit south along the eastern limit of the city, west along the hydro-electric transmission line situated south of McNicoll Avenue, south along Highway 404, west along Finch Avenue East, south along the Don River East Branch, west along Highway 401, northwest along the Don River West Branch, north along Bathurst Street, east along Drewry Avenue, north along Chelmsford Avenue, west along Greenwin Village Road, and north along Village Gate to the northern city limit.\n\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of that part of the City of Toronto described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the northerly limit of said city with Victoria Park Avenue; thence southerly along said avenue to the hydroelectric transmission line situated northerly of Apache Trail; thence southwesterly along said transmission line to Highway No. 404; thence southerly along said highway to Finch Avenue East; thence generally westerly along said avenue to Leslie Street; thence southerly along said street to Highway No. 401; thence generally southwesterly along said highway to the Don River West Branch; thence generally northwesterly along said branch to Bathurst Street; thence northerly along said street to the hydroelectric transmission line situated northerly of Finch Avenue West; thence generally easterly along said transmission line to Yonge Street; thence northerly along said street to the northerly limit of said city; thence easterly along said limit to the point of commencement.\n\nThis riding lost territory (36%) to [[Don Valley North]], and gained territory from [[York Centre]] (16%) during the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]].  The reduction in land area of the riding was primarily facilitated by substantial population growth along Yonge Street where the on-going redevelopment of land into additional high-rise residential buildings continued with medium-density development (low-rise residential buildings and townhomes) occurring slightly further from Yonge Street and along Sheppard and Finch Avenues.  The portion of the City of Toronto north of Highway 401 and east of Victoria Park Avenue (the former boundary with Scarborough) was allocated an additional riding now having five ridings versus the previous four.\n\n===Former boundaries===\n<gallery>\nImage:Willowdale, 1976.png|1976 to 1987\n\nImage:Willowdale, 1987.png|1987 to 1996\n\nImage:Willowdale, 1996.png|1996 to 2003\n\nImage:Willowdale

(Canada)|electoral district]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. It has been represented in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] since 1979.\n\nFor a long time this riding was considered a Liberal stronghold, having been won by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in all but one election since 1980. Longtime Liberal MP [[Jim Peterson]] was the riding's MP from 1980 to 1984 and from 1988 to 2007, and [[Martha Hall Findlay]] was the riding MP from 2008 to 2011. Long considered a safe Liberal seat, Conservative candidate [[Chungsen Leung]] won by 932 votes on the May 2, 2011 federal election. In the 2015 federal election, the seat returned to the Liberal Party with [[Ali Ehsassi]] unseating Leung. This district is home to some landmarks like [[Mel Lastman Square]], the [[Toronto Centre for the Arts]] and the [[Claude Watson School for the Arts]].\n\n==Geography==\nConsisting of that part of the City of Toronto described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the northerly limit of said city with Bayview Avenue; thence southerly along said avenue to Highway No. 401; thence generally southwesterly along said highway to the Don River West Branch; thence generally northwesterly along said branch to Bathurst Street; thence northerly along said street to the northerly limit of said city; thence easterly along said limit to the point of commencement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elections.ca/res/cir/maps2/mapprov.asp?map=35115&lang=e | title=Willowdale - Maps Corner - Elections Canada Online | publisher=Elections Canada | accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe riding contains the neighbourhoods of [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]], [[Lansing, Toronto|Lansing]], [[Newtonbrook]] and [[North York Centre]].\n\n==Demographics==\n:''According to the [[Canada 2011 Census]]; 2013 representation<ref>http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FED2013&Code1=35115&Data=Count&SearchText=Willowdale&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1</ref><ref>http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FED2013&Code1=35115&Data=Count&SearchText=Willowdale&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1#tabs2</ref>''\n\n'''Languages:''' 35.7% English, 19.1% Chinese, 9.8% Persian, 9.2% Korean, 5.8% Russian, 2.6% Tagalog, 1.7% Italian, 1.6% Spanish, 1.3% French, 1.2% Arabic<br />'''Religions:''' 46.0% Christian (20.6% Catholic, 4.3% Christian Orthodox, 3.2% Presbyterian, 2.4% United Church, 2.4% Anglican, 1.8% Baptist, 6.5% Pentecostal, 11.3% Other), 11.6% Muslim, 6.6% Jewish, 2.9% Buddhist, 1.8% Hindu, 30.4% No religion <br />'''Median income (2010):''' $26,200 <br />'''Average income (2010):''' $42,045\n\nAs per the 2016 Census, Willowdale has highest percentage of ethnic Iranians (12.1%) and ethnic Koreans (10.6%) of all City of Toronto ridings, and is one of the only four ridings with Chinese being the most frequent ethnic origin. At the same vein, it is the City of Toronto riding with the highest percentage of people belonging to the West Asian (10.9%) and Korean (10.3%) visible minorities.\n\n'''Ethnicity groups:''' White: 33.1%, Chinese: 25.3%, West Asian: 10.9%, Korean: 10.3%, South Asian: 5.9%, Filipino: 5.4%\n\n'''Ethnic origins:''' Chinese 25.9%, Iranian 12.1%, Korean 10.6%, English 6.4%, Filipino 5.8%, Canadian 5.6%, Russian 5.2%\n\n==History==\nThe riding was created in 1976 from part of [[Eglinton (electoral district)|Eglinton]], [[York North]] and [[York Centre]].\n\nWillowdale consisted initially of the part of the Borough of [[North York]] bounded on the north by the borough limit (Steeles Avenue), on the West by the West Branch of the Don River and Bathurst Street, on the south by Highway 401, and on the east by Bayview Avenue.\n\nIn 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north by the borough limits (Steeles Avenue), and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the borough limit southeast along the Don River West Branch, south along Bayview Avenue, east along Finch Avenue East, south along the Don River East Branch, west along Highway 401, and northwest along the Don River West Branch to the borough limit.\n\nIn 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north by the borough limits (Steeles Avenue), and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the borough limit south along the eastern limit of the city, west along the hydro-electric transmission line situated south of McNicoll Avenue, south along Highway 404, west along Finch Avenue East, south along the Don River East Branch, west along Highway 401, northwest along the Don River West Branch, north along Bathurst Street, east along Drewry Avenue, north along Chelmsford Avenue, west along Greenwin Village Road, and north along Village Gate to the northern city limit.\n\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of that part of the City of Toronto described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the northerly limit of said city with Victoria Park Avenue; thence southerly along said avenue to the hydroelectric transmission line situated northerly of Apache Trail; thence southwesterly along said transmission line to Highway No. 404; thence southerly along said highway to Finch Avenue East; thence generally westerly along said avenue to Leslie Street; thence southerly along said street to Highway No. 401; thence generally southwesterly along said highway to the Don River West Branch; thence generally northwesterly along said branch to Bathurst Street; thence northerly along said street to the hydroelectric transmission line situated northerly of Finch Avenue West; thence generally easterly along said transmission line to Yonge Street; thence northerly along said street to the northerly limit of said city; thence easterly along said limit to the point of commencement.\n\nThis riding lost territory (36%) to [[Don Valley North]], and gained territory from [[York Centre]] (16%) during the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]].  The reduction in land area of the riding was primarily facilitated by substantial population growth along Yonge Street where the on-going redevelopment of land into additional high-rise residential buildings continued with medium-density development (low-rise residential buildings and townhomes) occurring slightly further from Yonge Street and along Sheppard and Finch Avenues.  The portion of the City of Toronto north of Highway 401 and east of Victoria Park Avenue (the former boundary with Scarborough) was allocated an additional riding now having five ridings versus the previous four.\n\n===Former boundaries===\n<gallery>\nImage:Willowdale, 1976.png|1976 to 1987\n\nImage:Willowdale, 1987.png|1987 to 1996\n\nImage:Willowdale, 1996.png|1996 to 2003\n\nImage:Willowdale
