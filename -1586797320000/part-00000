Her mother points out four mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning she is consoled by her best friend, Nancy Thompson, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz. The two stay at Tina's house when Tina's mother goes out of town, but their sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of being chased by the disfigured man. Rod is awoken by Tina's thrashing and sees her dragged and fatally slashed by an unseen force; he flees as Nancy and Glen awaken to find Tina covered in blood and dead.\n\nThe next day, Rod is arrested by Nancy's father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class. While masquerading as Tina, the man chases her to the boiler room where she is cornered and burns her arm on a pipe. The burn startles her awake in class and she notices a burn mark on her arm. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by the man. Nancy goes to Rod at the police station, who tells her about what happened to Tina and his own similar dreams; this makes Nancy believe that the man is responsible for Tina's death.\n\nNancy invites Glen to watch over her as she falls asleep. In her dream, she sees the man prepare to kill Rod in his cell, but then he turns his attention towards her. Nancy runs away and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod by wrapping bed sheets around his neck like a noose. Nancy and Glen find his body hanging in his cell. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes her dream. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a sleep disorders clinic, where, in a dream, Nancy grabs the man's fedora and pulls it from the dream into reality.\n\nMarge begins to drink and smoke heavily and bars the windows at home. She reveals to Nancy that the man, [[Freddy Krueger|Fred Krueger]] was an insane child murderer who was released on a technicality and then burned alive by Marge, Don, and other parents (who lived on their street) seeking vigilante justice. Nancy realizes that Krueger, now a vengeful ghost, desires revenge and to satiate his psychopathic needs. She tries to call Glen to warn him, but his father prevents her from speaking to him. Glen falls asleep and is sucked into his bed by Krueger, and a large fountain of blood is released in his room. Now alone, Nancy puts Marge to sleep and asks Don, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in twenty minutes. She rigs booby traps around the house, and grabs Krueger out of the dream and into the real world. The booby traps affect Krueger enough that Nancy is able to light him on fire with a Molotov cocktail and lock him in the basement. Nancy rushes to the door for help. The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don go upstairs to find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don puts out the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed.\n\nWhen Don leaves the room, Krueger rises from the bed behind Nancy. Realizing that Krueger is powered by his victim's fear of him, Nancy calmly turns her back to him and Krueger evaporates when he attempts to lunge at her.\n\nNancy steps outside into a bright and foggy morning where all of her friends and her mother are still alive. As she gets into Glen's convertible to go to school, the top (patterned like Krueger's sweater) suddenly comes down and locks them in as the car drives uncontrollably down the street. Three girls in white dresses playing jump rope are heard chanting Krueger's nursery rhyme as Marge is grabbed by Krueger through the front door window.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\nThe cast of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' included a crew of veteran actors such as Robert Englund and John Saxon and several aspiring young actors like Johnny Depp and Heather Langenkamp.\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Heather Langenkamp]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]\n* [[John Saxon]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Donald Thompson|Lt.

Craven chose to make Krueger's sweater red and green after reading an article in a 1982 ''[[Scientific American]]'' that said these two colors were the most clashing colors to the human retina.<ref name=\"cinefantastique\"/>\n\nCraven strove to make Krueger different from other horror film villains of the era. \"A lot of the killers were wearing masks: [[Leatherface]], [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]],\" he recalled in 2014. \"I wanted my villain to have a mask, but be able to talk and taunt and threaten. So I thought of him being burned and scarred.\" He also felt the killer should use something other than a knife because it was too common. \"So I thought, 'How about a glove with steak knives?'

I wanted somebody who was an actor rather than a stuntman, somebody who could convey a sense of evil and who was very enthusiastic about getting to an evil state. You really have to get malicious and malevolent and a lot of actors just don't want to get there; their heart isn't in it.

Her mother points out four mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning she is consoled by her best friend, Nancy Thompson, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz. The two stay at Tina's house when Tina's mother goes out of town, but their sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of being chased by the disfigured man. Rod is awoken by Tina's thrashing and sees her dragged and fatally slashed by an unseen force; he flees as Nancy and Glen awaken to find Tina covered in blood and dead.\n\nThe next day, Rod is arrested by Nancy's father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class. While masquerading as Tina, the man chases her to the boiler room where she is cornered and burns her arm on a pipe. The burn startles her awake in class and she notices a burn mark on her arm. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by the man. Nancy goes to Rod at the police station, who tells her about what happened to Tina and his own similar dreams; this makes Nancy believe that the man is responsible for Tina's death.\n\nNancy invites Glen to watch over her as she falls asleep. In her dream, she sees the man prepare to kill Rod in his cell, but then he turns his attention towards her. Nancy runs away and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod by wrapping bed sheets around his neck like a noose. Nancy and Glen find his body hanging in his cell. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes her dream. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a sleep disorders clinic, where, in a dream, Nancy grabs the man's fedora and pulls it from the dream into reality.\n\nMarge begins to drink and smoke heavily and bars the windows at home. She reveals to Nancy that the man, [[Freddy Krueger|Fred Krueger]] was an insane child murderer who was released on a technicality and then burned alive by Marge, Don, and other parents (who lived on their street) seeking vigilante justice. Nancy realizes that Krueger, now a vengeful ghost, desires revenge and to satiate his psychopathic needs. She tries to call Glen to warn him, but his father prevents her from speaking to him. Glen falls asleep and is sucked into his bed by Krueger, and a large fountain of blood is released in his room. Now alone, Nancy puts Marge to sleep and asks Don, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in twenty minutes. She rigs booby traps around the house, and grabs Krueger out of the dream and into the real world. The booby traps affect Krueger enough that Nancy is able to light him on fire with a Molotov cocktail and lock him in the basement. Nancy rushes to the door for help. The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don go upstairs to find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don puts out the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed.\n\nWhen Don leaves the room, Krueger rises from the bed behind Nancy.

It has since been released on [[DVD]], first in 1999 in the United States as part of the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' Collection box set (along with the other six sequels), and once again in a restored Infinifilm special edition in 2006, containing various special features with contributions from Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and the director of photography.\n\nThe special edition consisted of two DVDs, one with the film picture and sound restored (DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, and original mono audio track) and another DVD with special features. Along with the restored version of the film, DVD one also had two commentaries, and other nightmares (if not all) from the film's sequels (two through seven and ''Freddy Vs. Jason''). It also included additional, extended or alternate scenes of the film, such as one scene where Marge reveals to Nancy that she had another sibling who was killed by Freddy. These unused clips and scenes were not included or added to the DVD film but could be viewed separately from the DVD's menus.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, the film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] by [[Warner Home Video]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Warner_Brothers/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%281984%29_Announced_for_Blu-ray_/4030 |title=A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)' Announced for Blu-ray |author=High-Def Digest |date=January 7, 2010 <!-- at 01:45 PM ET --> |publisher=High Def Digest |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128032545/http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Warner_Brothers/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%281984%29_Announced_for_Blu-ray_/4030 |archive-date=November 28, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with all the same extras from the 2006 special edition;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/35246/the-original-a-nightmare-elm-street-coming-blu-ray |title=The Original A Nightmare on Elm Street Coming to Blu-ray! |author=[[Dread Central]] |date=January 7, 2010 |work=Dread Central |accessdate=January 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110064813/https://dreadcentral.com/news/35246/the-original-a-nightmare-elm-street-coming-blu-ray| archivedate=January 10, 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> a DVD box set containing all of the films up to that point was released on the same day.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/35251/new-elm-street-box-set-coming-wait-until-you-see-cover |title=New Elm Street Box Set Coming!

Majumdar]] says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of [[Sindh]], their only conquest for nearly 300 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A.

At the beginning of the 13th century, the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan was Mewar. The Rajputs resisted the Muslim incursions into India, although a number of Rajput kingdoms eventually became subservient to the [[Delhi Sultanate]].\n \nThe Rajputs put up resistance to the Islamic invasions with their warfare and chivalry for centuries.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur.\n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The [[Luni River]] and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great [[Rann of Kutch]] wetland in neighbouring [[Gujarat]]. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The [[Ghaggar River]], which originates in [[Haryana]], is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive [[Sarasvati river]].\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{main|Wildlife of Rajasthan}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"margin:1em; float:right; width:25%;\"\n|+ '''State symbols of '''Rajasthan'''\n|-\n| '''Formation day'''\n| 1 November\n|-\n| '''State animal'''\n| [[Chinkara]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\">{{cite web|title=States and Union Territories Symbols|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112080035/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Camel]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Now the state animal camel|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=Patrika Group|date=1 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806141624/http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|archivedate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''State bird'''\n| [[Great Indian bustard|Godavan (great Indian bustard)]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State flower'''\n| Flower \u2013 [[Tecomella undulata|Rohida]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State Tree'''\n| [[Prosopis cineraria|Khejri]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|}\n[[File:Sonchiriya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[great Indian bustard]] has been classed as [[critically endangered]] since 2011.]]\nThough a large percentage of the total area is desert with little forest cover, Rajasthan has a rich and varied flora and fauna.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. \n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur.

Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is known for its snacks like [[Bikaneri Bhujia]]. Other famous dishes include ''bajre ki roti'' (millet bread) and ''lahsun ki chutney'' (hot garlic paste), ''mawa kachori'' [[Mirchi Bada]], [[Pyaaj Kachori]] and [[ghevar]] from Jodhpur, [[Alwar]] ka Mawa (milk cake), ''Kadhi kachori'' from Ajmer, ''malpauas'' from Pushkar, Daal [[kachori]] (Kota kachori) from Kota and rassgollas from Bikaner. Originating from the [[Marwar]] region of the state is the concept of [[Marwari Bhojnalaya]], or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the [[Marwari people]].\n\n[[Dal baati|Dal-Bati-Churma]] is very popular in Rajasthan. The traditional way to serve it is to first coarsely mash the Baati, and then pour pure ghee on top of it. It is served with the daal (lentils) and spicy garlic chutney. Also served with besan (gram flour) ki kadi. It is commonly served at all festivities, including religious occasions, wedding ceremonies, and birthday parties in Rajasthan.\n\nThe [[Ghoomar]] dance from Jaipur, Jodhpur and [[Kalbelia]] of the Kalbelia tribe have gained international recognition. Folk music is a large part of Rajasthani culture. The [[Manganiyar]] and [[Langha (tribe)|Langa]] communities from Rajasthan are notable for their folk music. [[Kathputli (puppetry)|Kathputli]], [[Bhopa]], Chang, Teratali, Ghindr, [[Gair dance]], Kachchhi Ghori, and [[Tejaji]] are examples of traditional Rajasthani culture. Folk songs are commonly ballads which relate heroic deeds and love stories; and religious or devotional songs known as bhajans and banis which are often accompanied by musical instruments like [[dholak]], [[sitar]], and [[sarangi]] are also sung.\n\nRajasthan is known for its traditional, colourful art. The block prints, tie and dye prints, gota patti (main), Bagaru prints, Sanganer prints, and [[Zari]] embroidery are major export products from Rajasthan. Handicraft items like wooden furniture and crafts, carpets, and blue pottery are commonly found here. Shopping reflects the colourful culture, Rajasthani clothes have a lot of mirror work and embroidery. A Rajasthani traditional dress for females comprises an ankle-length skirt and a short top, known as ''[[chaniya choli]]''Mainly pure owned by traditional people . A piece of cloth is used to cover the head, both for protection from heat and maintenance of modesty. Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colours like blue, yellow and orange.\n\nThe main religious festivals are [[Deepawali]], [[Holi]], [[Gangaur]], [[Teej]], [[Gogaji]], [[Devnarayan|Shri Devnarayan Jayanti]], [[Makar Sankranti]] and [[Janmashtami]], as the main religion is [[Hinduism]].

Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest [[List of Greek mythological figures#Heroes|Greek heroes]]: [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] in [[Roman mythology]]) and [[Perseus]]. According to the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]], Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in extreme [[Hesperides|west]].<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Later, he became commonly identified with the [[Atlas Mountains]] in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of [[Mauretania]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy.

In Ancient Greek, Plato's Timaeus dialogue also mentions \"\u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2\" (English:\"[[Atlantis]] nisos\") meaning \"Atlas's Island\", giving rise to the English derivative: Atlantis (Atlantean / of Atlas).<ref>https://www.dictionary.com/e/atlantis/</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Atlas'' is uncertain. [[Virgil]] took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is ''durus'', \"hard, enduring\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.247: \"''Atlantis duri''\" and other instances; see Robert W. Cruttwell, \"Virgil, Aeneid, iv. 247: 'Atlantis Duri'\" ''The Classical Review'' '''59'''.1 (May 1945), p. 11.</ref> which suggested to George Doig<ref>George Doig, \"Vergil's Art and the Greek Language\" ''The Classical Journal'' '''64'''.1 (October 1968, pp. 1-6) p. 2.</ref> that Virgil was aware of the Greek \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \"to endure\"; Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of [[Strabo]]'s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was ''Douris''. Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]], it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the [[Berber languages|Berber]], specifically ''\u00e1dr\u0101r'' 'mountain'.<ref>Strabo, 17.3;</ref>\n\nTraditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 ([[genitive case|genitive]]: \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) as comprised from copulative \u03b1- and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*telh\u2082-'' 'to uphold, support' (whence also \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem.<ref name=\"Beekes\">{{Cite document|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |volume=1 |author-link=Robert Beekes |first=Robert |last=Beekes |first2=Lucien |last2=van Beek |page=163 |year=2010 |publisher=Brill|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to [[Tartarus]], but [[Zeus]] condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia (the Earth)]] and hold up the sky on his shoulders.<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Thus, he was ''Atlas Telamon'', \"enduring Atlas,\" and became a doublet of [[Coeus]], the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.<ref>The usage in [[Virgil]]'s ''maximum Atlas axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum'' (''Aeneid'', iv.481f , cf vi.796f), combining poetic and parascientific images, is discussed in P. R. Hardie, \"Atlas and Axis\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' N.S. '''33'''.1 (1983:220-228).</ref>\n\nA common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the [[celestial spheres]], not the [[globe|terrestrial globe]]; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned [[Farnese Atlas]] may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of ''atlas'' to describe a corpus of [[Atlas|terrestrial maps]].\n\n===Encounter with Perseus===\n{{main|Perseus}}\nThe Greek poet [[Polyidus]] c. 398 BC<ref>[[Polyeidos (poet)|Polyeidos]], Fragment 837; Ovid, 'Metamorphoses'' 4.627''</ref> tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering [[Perseus]] who [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned him to stone]]. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a King.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', IV.617ff ([http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Perseus.html#Atlas on-line English translation at Theoi Project]).</ref> According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas' Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy which warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality.<ref name=\"LOTN\"/> In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas' head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but [[Heracles]], another son of Zeus, and Perseus' great-grandson.<ref>{{harvp|Ogden|2008|pp=49, 108, 114}}</ref>\n\n===Encounter with Heracles===\n{{main|Heracles}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|Atlas and Hercules]]\nOne of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]] of the hero [[Heracles]] was to fetch some of the golden apples which grow in [[Hera]]'s garden, tended by Atlas' reputed daughters, the [[Hesperides]] which were also called the Atlantides, and guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.<ref name=\":0\">[[Diodorus Siculus]].

Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.\n\nIn some versions,<ref>A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by Strabo (3.5.5) was the earliest reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\"; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.</ref> Heracles instead built the two great [[Pillars of Hercules]] to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated [[Prometheus]].\n\n===Other Variations===\n[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Atlas and the Hesperides - 1925.jpg|thumb|''Atlas and the Hesperides'' by Singer Sargent, John (1925)]]\n\n====King of Atlantis====\nAccording to [[Plato]], the first king of [[Atlantis]] was also named '''Atlas''', but that Atlas was a son of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal woman Cleito.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''</ref> The works of [[Eusebius]]<ref name=\"Eusebius\"/> and [[Diodorus]]<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/> also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas' father was [[Uranus]] and his mother was [[Gaia]]. His grandfather was [[Elyon#Sanchuniathon|Elium]] \"King of [[Phoenicia]]\" who lived in [[Byblos]] with his wife [[Baal Berith|Beruth]]. Atlas was raised by his sister, [[Basilea (queen)|Basilia]].<ref>For further comment on Mercator's chosen Titanic genealogy see {{harvp|Keuning|1947}}, {{harvp|Akerman|1994}} and {{harvp|Ramachandran|2015|p=42}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>See {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III}}, Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' references the same mythology as Diodorus stating \"These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the Atlanteans\".</ref>\n\n====King of Mauretania====\nAtlas was also a legendary king of [[Mauretania]], the land of the [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern [[Maghreb]]. In the 16th century [[Gerardus Mercator]] put together the first collection of maps to be called an \"[[Atlas]]\" and devoted his book to the \"King of Mauretania\".<ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>{{harvp|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|p=103}}</ref>\n\nAtlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the [[Hesperides]], \"Nymphs\" which guarded the [[golden apple]]s, and [[Gorgons]] both of which lived beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].<ref>See {{harvp|Gantz|1993|p=401}} and {{harvp|Ogden|2008|p=47-49}}</ref> [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the [[Aethiopian Sea]]. The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]] due to [[Phoenicia]]n exploration.<ref>For instance the Phoenician [[Hanno the Navigator]] is said to have sailed as far as [[Mount Cameroon]] in the 5th or 6th century BC. See {{harvp|Lempri\u00e8re|1833|pp=249-250}} and Ovid, ''The Metamorphoses'', commented by Henry T. Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref> The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over [[Aethiopia]], the blood of Medusa's head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the habit of associating Atlas' home to a chain of mountains, the [[Atlas mountains]], which were near [[Mauretania]] and [[Numidia]], was firmly entrenched.<ref>{{harvp|Lempri\u00e8re|1833|pp=249-250}}</ref>\n\n====Other====\n<!-- Hatnote at [[Aril]] redirects here -->\nThe identifying name ''Aril'' is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from [[Vulci]] and a ring from an unknown site.<ref>Paolo Martini, ''Il nome etrusco di Atlante'', (Rome:Universit\u00e0 di Roma) 1987 investigates the etymology of ''aril'', rejecting a link to the verbal morpheme ''ar-'' (\"support\") in favor of a Phoenician etymon in an unattested possible form ''*'arrab(a)'', signifying \"guarantor in a commercial transaction\" with the connotation of \"mediator\", related to the Latin borrowing ''arillator'', \"middleman\".

Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest [[List of Greek mythological figures#Heroes|Greek heroes]]: [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] in [[Roman mythology]]) and [[Perseus]]. According to the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]], Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in extreme [[Hesperides|west]].<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Later, he became commonly identified with the [[Atlas Mountains]] in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of [[Mauretania]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy.

In Ancient Greek, Plato's Timaeus dialogue also mentions \"\u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2\" (English:\"[[Atlantis]] nisos\") meaning \"Atlas's Island\", giving rise to the English derivative: Atlantis (Atlantean / of Atlas).<ref>https://www.dictionary.com/e/atlantis/</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Atlas'' is uncertain. [[Virgil]] took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is ''durus'', \"hard, enduring\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.247: \"''Atlantis duri''\" and other instances; see Robert W. Cruttwell, \"Virgil, Aeneid, iv. 247: 'Atlantis Duri'\" ''The Classical Review'' '''59'''.1 (May 1945), p. 11.</ref> which suggested to George Doig<ref>George Doig, \"Vergil's Art and the Greek Language\" ''The Classical Journal'' '''64'''.1 (October 1968, pp. 1-6) p. 2.</ref> that Virgil was aware of the Greek \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \"to endure\"; Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of [[Strabo]]'s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was ''Douris''. Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]], it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the [[Berber languages|Berber]], specifically ''\u00e1dr\u0101r'' 'mountain'.<ref>Strabo, 17.3;</ref>\n\nTraditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 ([[genitive case|genitive]]: \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) as comprised from copulative \u03b1- and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*telh\u2082-'' 'to uphold, support' (whence also \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem.<ref name=\"Beekes\">{{Cite document|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |volume=1 |author-link=Robert Beekes |first=Robert |last=Beekes |first2=Lucien |last2=van Beek |page=163 |year=2010 |publisher=Brill|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to [[Tartarus]], but [[Zeus]] condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia (the Earth)]] and hold up the sky on his shoulders.<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Thus, he was ''Atlas Telamon'', \"enduring Atlas,\" and became a doublet of [[Coeus]], the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.<ref>The usage in [[Virgil]]'s ''maximum Atlas axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum'' (''Aeneid'', iv.481f , cf vi.796f), combining poetic and parascientific images, is discussed in P. R. Hardie, \"Atlas and Axis\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' N.S. '''33'''.1 (1983:220-228).</ref>\n\nA common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the [[celestial spheres]], not the [[globe|terrestrial globe]]; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned [[Farnese Atlas]] may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of ''atlas'' to describe a corpus of [[Atlas|terrestrial maps]].\n\n===Encounter with Perseus===\n{{main|Perseus}}\nThe Greek poet [[Polyidus]] c. 398 BC<ref>[[Polyeidos (poet)|Polyeidos]], Fragment 837; Ovid, 'Metamorphoses'' 4.627''</ref> tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering [[Perseus]] who [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned him to stone]]. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a King.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', IV.617ff ([http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Perseus.html#Atlas on-line English translation at Theoi Project]).</ref> According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas' Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy which warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality.<ref name=\"LOTN\"/> In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas' head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but [[Heracles]], another son of Zeus, and Perseus' great-grandson.<ref>{{harvp|Ogden|2008|pp=49, 108, 114}}</ref>\n\n===Encounter with Heracles===\n{{main|Heracles}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|Atlas and Hercules]]\nOne of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]] of the hero [[Heracles]] was to fetch some of the golden apples which grow in [[Hera]]'s garden, tended by Atlas' reputed daughters, the [[Hesperides]] which were also called the Atlantides, and guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.<ref name=\":0\">[[Diodorus Siculus]].

Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.\n\nIn some versions,<ref>A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by Strabo (3.5.5) was the earliest reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\"; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.</ref> Heracles instead built the two great [[Pillars of Hercules]] to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated [[Prometheus]].\n\n===Other Variations===\n[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Atlas and the Hesperides - 1925.jpg|thumb|''Atlas and the Hesperides'' by Singer Sargent, John (1925)]]\n\n====King of Atlantis====\nAccording to [[Plato]], the first king of [[Atlantis]] was also named '''Atlas''', but that Atlas was a son of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal woman Cleito.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''</ref> The works of [[Eusebius]]<ref name=\"Eusebius\"/> and [[Diodorus]]<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/> also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas' father was [[Uranus]] and his mother was [[Gaia]]. His grandfather was [[Elyon#Sanchuniathon|Elium]] \"King of [[Phoenicia]]\" who lived in [[Byblos]] with his wife [[Baal Berith|Beruth]]. Atlas was raised by his sister, [[Basilea (queen)|Basilia]].<ref>For further comment on Mercator's chosen Titanic genealogy see {{harvp|Keuning|1947}}, {{harvp|Akerman|1994}} and {{harvp|Ramachandran|2015|p=42}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>See {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III}}, Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' references the same mythology as Diodorus stating \"These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the Atlanteans\".</ref>\n\n====King of Mauretania====\nAtlas was also a legendary king of [[Mauretania]], the land of the [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern [[Maghreb]]. In the 16th century [[Gerardus Mercator]] put together the first collection of maps to be called an \"[[Atlas]]\" and devoted his book to the \"King of Mauretania\".<ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>{{harvp|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|p=103}}</ref>\n\nAtlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the [[Hesperides]], \"Nymphs\" which guarded the [[golden apple]]s, and [[Gorgons]] both of which lived beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].<ref>See {{harvp|Gantz|1993|p=401}} and {{harvp|Ogden|2008|p=47-49}}</ref> [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the [[Aethiopian Sea]]. The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]] due to [[Phoenicia]]n exploration.<ref>For instance the Phoenician [[Hanno the Navigator]] is said to have sailed as far as [[Mount Cameroon]] in the 5th or 6th century BC.

Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref> The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over [[Aethiopia]], the blood of Medusa's head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the habit of associating Atlas' home to a chain of mountains, the [[Atlas mountains]], which were near [[Mauretania]] and [[Numidia]], was firmly entrenched.<ref>{{harvp|Lempri\u00e8re|1833|pp=249-250}}</ref>\n\n====Other====\n<!-- Hatnote at [[Aril]] redirects here -->\nThe identifying name ''Aril'' is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from [[Vulci]] and a ring from an unknown site.<ref>Paolo Martini, ''Il nome etrusco di Atlante'', (Rome:Universit\u00e0 di Roma) 1987 investigates the etymology of ''aril'', rejecting a link to the verbal morpheme ''ar-'' (\"support\") in favor of a Phoenician etymon in an unattested possible form ''*'arrab(a)'', signifying \"guarantor in a commercial transaction\" with the connotation of \"mediator\", related to the Latin borrowing ''arillator'', \"middleman\".

Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsud\u014d shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsud\u014d Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nNew studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eiz\u014d Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (including ''[[Ugetsu]]''/''Ugetsu Monogatari'') retain a very high reputation.\n\nJapanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]], [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.\n\nWith the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-leaning tendencies. Directors [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]] were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced [[35mm movie film|35 mm films]], the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19\u201347.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Ky\u014dfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>\n\nA later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on flammable and unstable [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]\nUnlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.<ref>\"[http://filmsound.org/film-sound-history/sound-in-japan.htm The Transition to Sound in Japan]\", Freda Freiberg, Filmsound.org</ref> For instance, [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'' (1935), considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).\n\nFilm criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genj\u016b Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>\n\nThe 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.\n\n===1940s===\n\n====Wartime movies====\n[[File:Li_Xianglan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]]]]\n{{further|War film}}\n\nBecause of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.\n\nDuring this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.\n\n[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]] was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The [[Manchukuo Film Association]] let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years.\n\n[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943.\n\n====American Occupation====\n[[File:Yoko Sugi and Setsuko Hara in Aoi Sanmyaku.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tadashi Imai]]'s \"[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\" starring [[Y\u014dko Sugi]] and [[Setsuko Hara]] (1949)]]\n\nIn 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II, the rule of Japan by the SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) began. Movies produced in Japan were managed by GHQ's subordinate organization CIE (Civil Information Educational Section, \u6c11\u9593\u60c5\u5831\u6559\u80b2\u5c40). This management system lasted until 1952, and it was the first time in the Japanese movie world that management and control by a foreign institution was implemented. During the planning and scripting stages it was translated to English, only the movies approved by the CIE were produced. For example, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[Akatsuki no Dass\u014d]]\u201d (1950) was originally a work depicting a Korean military comfort woman starring [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]], but with dozens of CIE censorship, it became an original work.<ref>\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u53f2\uff11\uff10\uff10\u5e74\u300dp.134 (100 years of Japanese film history)</ref> The completed film was censored a second time by a CCD ([[Civil Censorship Detachment]]). The censorship was also carried out retroactively to past movie works.<ref>\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u53f2\uff11\uff10\uff10\u5e74\u300dp.129 (\"100 Years of Japanese Film History\")</ref> Japan was exposed to over a decade's worth of American [[animation]] that were banned under the war-time government.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the occupation policy, the issue of responsibility for war spread to the film industry, and when voices of banning war cooperators in movie production during the war began to be expressed, [[Nagamasa Kawakita]], [[Kanichi Negishi]], [[Shiro Kido]] in 1947, the person who was involved in such high-motion films was exiled. However, as in other genre pursuits, the position of responsibility for war has been dealt with vaguely in the film industry, and the above measures were lifted in 1950.\n\nThe first movie released after the war was \u201cSoyokaze\u201d (\u305d\u3088\u304b\u305c) 1945 by [[Yasushi Sasaki]], and the theme song \u201c[[Ringo no Uta (1946 song)|Ringo no Uta]]\u201d by [[Michiko Namiki]] was a big hit.\n\nIn the production ban list promulgated in 1945 by CIE's David Conde, nationalism, patriotism, suicide and slaughter, brutal violent movies, etc. became prohibited items, making the production of historical drama virtually impossible . As a result, actors who have been using historical drama as their business appeared in contemporary drama. This includes [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]]'s \u201c[[Bannai Tarao]]\u201d (1946), [[Tsumasabur\u014d Band\u014d]]'s \u201c[[Torn Drum]] (\u7834\u308c\u592a\u9f13)\u201d (1949), [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s \u201cThe Child Holding Hands (\u624b\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\u5b50\u7b49)\u201d, and [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]]'s \u201cKing (\u738b\u5c06)\u201d.\n\n[[File:Yoshiko Kuga 530406 Scan10007.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Yoshiko Kuga]]]]\n\nIn addition, many propaganda films were produced as democratic courtesy works recommended by SCAP. Significant movies among them are, [[Setsuko Hara]] appeared in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]\u201d (1946), [[K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura]]'s \u201c[[A Ball at the Anjo House]]\u201d (1947), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s \u201c[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\u201d (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In [[Yasushi Sasaki]]'s \"[[Hata no Seishun]] (\u306f\u305f\u3061\u306e\u9752\u6625)\" (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed.\n\nThe first collaborations between [[Akira Kurosawa]] and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] were ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' in 1948 and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' in 1949. [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]] directed the critically and commercially successful ''[[Late Spring]]'' in 1949.\n\nThe [[Mainichi Film Award]] was created in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/cinema/mfa/etc/about.html |script-title=ja:\u6bce\u65e5\u6620\u753b\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u306f |publisher=mainichi.jp|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n===1950s===\n\n[[File:Yasujiro Ozu 01.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]]]\n\nThe 1950s are widely considered the [[Golden age (metaphor)|Golden Age]] of Japanese cinema.<ref name=Kehr/> Three Japanese films from this decade (''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Story]]'') appeared in the top ten of ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s critics' and directors' polls for the [[Films considered the greatest ever|best films of all time]] in 2002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021222042917/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/ BFI | Sight & Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002]</ref> They also appeared in the 2012 polls,<ref name=\"bfi\">{{cite news |authors=Sight & Sound contributors, [[Ian Christie (film scholar)|Ian Christie]] |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time |work=[[Sight & Sound]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |origyear=September 2012 |date=August 7, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"2012directors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/sight-sound-2012-directors-top-ten|title=2012 Directors' poll|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> with ''Tokyo Story'' (1953) dethroning ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' at the top of the [[The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|2012 directors' poll]].<ref name=\"2012directors\"/>\n\nWar movies restricted by [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] began to be produced, Hideo Sekigawa's \u201c[[Listen to the Voices of the Sea]]\u201d (1950), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s \u201cHimeyuri no T\u00f4 - Tower of the Lilies\u201d (1953), [[Keisuke Kinoshita]]'s \u201c[[Twenty-Four Eyes]]\u201d (1954), \u201c [[Kon Ichikawa]]'s \u201c[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]\u201d (1956), and other works aimed at the tragic and sentimental retrospective of the war experience, one after another, It became a social influence.

This period gave rise to the four great artists of Japanese cinema: [[Masaki Kobayashi]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways.\n\nThe decade started with [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''Rashomon'' (1950), which won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951 and the [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage.

It also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.\n\nThe year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.\n\nKenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujir\u014d Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].\n\nThe [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950.

A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.\n\nThe huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujir\u014d Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.\n\nKon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).\n\nThe 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Ab\u00e9 Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTeshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Masaki Kobayashi's ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Bushido, Samurai Saga]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]] won the Golden Bear at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]]. ''[[Immortal Love]]'' by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and ''[[Twin Sisters of Kyoto]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Chieko]]'', both by [[Noboru Nakamura]], also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Lost Spring]]'', also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television.

The resulting [[pink film]] industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.\n\n[[File:Nakadai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]]]\n\n[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'\u00c9tat]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.\n\nIn 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.\n\n[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)|The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Sh\u014dhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).\n\n''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.\n\nOf the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980.

[[Shinji S\u014dmai]], an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused [[Typhoon Club (film)| Typhoon Club]], and the critically acclaimed Roman porno [[Love Hotel (1985 film)| Love Hotel]] among others. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1985. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.\n\n[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.\n\n===1990s===\n\nBecause of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.\n\n[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sh\u014dhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sj\u00f6berg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997).

Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).\n\nHayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;\u2013 which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing film in Japan]]&nbsp;\u2013 and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).\n\nSeveral new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]\n\nThe number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production.

Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsud\u014d shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsud\u014d Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nNew studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eiz\u014d Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (including ''[[Ugetsu]]''/''Ugetsu Monogatari'') retain a very high reputation.\n\nJapanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]], [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.\n\nWith the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-leaning tendencies. Directors [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]] were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced [[35mm movie film|35 mm films]], the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19\u201347.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Ky\u014dfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>\n\nA later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on flammable and unstable [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]\nUnlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.<ref>\"[http://filmsound.org/film-sound-history/sound-in-japan.htm The Transition to Sound in Japan]\", Freda Freiberg, Filmsound.org</ref> For instance, [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'' (1935), considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).\n\nFilm criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genj\u016b Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>\n\nThe 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.\n\n===1940s===\n\n====Wartime movies====\n[[File:Li_Xianglan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]]]]\n{{further|War film}}\n\nBecause of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.\n\nDuring this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.\n\n[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]] was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The [[Manchukuo Film Association]] let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years.\n\n[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943.\n\n====American Occupation====\n[[File:Yoko Sugi and Setsuko Hara in Aoi Sanmyaku.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tadashi Imai]]'s \"[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\" starring [[Y\u014dko Sugi]] and [[Setsuko Hara]] (1949)]]\n\nIn 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II, the rule of Japan by the SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) began. Movies produced in Japan were managed by GHQ's subordinate organization CIE (Civil Information Educational Section, \u6c11\u9593\u60c5\u5831\u6559\u80b2\u5c40). This management system lasted until 1952, and it was the first time in the Japanese movie world that management and control by a foreign institution was implemented. During the planning and scripting stages it was translated to English, only the movies approved by the CIE were produced. For example, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[Akatsuki no Dass\u014d]]\u201d (1950) was originally a work depicting a Korean military comfort woman starring [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]], but with dozens of CIE censorship, it became an original work.<ref>\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u53f2\uff11\uff10\uff10\u5e74\u300dp.134 (100 years of Japanese film history)</ref> The completed film was censored a second time by a CCD ([[Civil Censorship Detachment]]).

However, as in other genre pursuits, the position of responsibility for war has been dealt with vaguely in the film industry, and the above measures were lifted in 1950.\n\nThe first movie released after the war was \u201cSoyokaze\u201d (\u305d\u3088\u304b\u305c) 1945 by [[Yasushi Sasaki]], and the theme song \u201c[[Ringo no Uta (1946 song)|Ringo no Uta]]\u201d by [[Michiko Namiki]] was a big hit.\n\nIn the production ban list promulgated in 1945 by CIE's David Conde, nationalism, patriotism, suicide and slaughter, brutal violent movies, etc. became prohibited items, making the production of historical drama virtually impossible . As a result, actors who have been using historical drama as their business appeared in contemporary drama. This includes [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]]'s \u201c[[Bannai Tarao]]\u201d (1946), [[Tsumasabur\u014d Band\u014d]]'s \u201c[[Torn Drum]] (\u7834\u308c\u592a\u9f13)\u201d (1949), [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s \u201cThe Child Holding Hands (\u624b\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\u5b50\u7b49)\u201d, and [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]]'s \u201cKing (\u738b\u5c06)\u201d.\n\n[[File:Yoshiko Kuga 530406 Scan10007.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Yoshiko Kuga]]]]\n\nIn addition, many propaganda films were produced as democratic courtesy works recommended by SCAP. Significant movies among them are, [[Setsuko Hara]] appeared in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]\u201d (1946), [[K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura]]'s \u201c[[A Ball at the Anjo House]]\u201d (1947), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s \u201c[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\u201d (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In [[Yasushi Sasaki]]'s \"[[Hata no Seishun]] (\u306f\u305f\u3061\u306e\u9752\u6625)\" (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed.\n\nThe first collaborations between [[Akira Kurosawa]] and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] were ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' in 1948 and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' in 1949.

Suzuki Ikuzo's Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tokyo File 212: Detail View|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=50894|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]}}</ref> ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'', a 1953 film by [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]], was the first movie that filmed using [[Eastmancolor]] film, ''Gate of Hell'' was both [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]]'s first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1954 for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] by [[Sanzo Wada]] and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.\n\nThe year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.\n\nKenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujir\u014d Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].\n\nThe [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[Until We Meet Again (1950 film)|Until We Meet Again]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]].\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Toshiro Mifune 1954 Scan10003 160913.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Toshiro Mifune]] was at the center of many of Kurosawa's films.]]\n\nThe number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/japanesecinemain195060/ ''Japanese Cinema in the 1950s and 1960s'']</ref> Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a \"program picture\" or B-movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.\n\nThe huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujir\u014d Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.\n\nKon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).\n\nThe 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Ab\u00e9 Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTeshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Masaki Kobayashi's ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Bushido, Samurai Saga]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]] won the Golden Bear at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]]. ''[[Immortal Love]]'' by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and ''[[Twin Sisters of Kyoto]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Chieko]]'', both by [[Noboru Nakamura]], also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Lost Spring]]'', also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.<ref>\n{{cite book|last1=Sato|first1=Tadao|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|publisher=Kodansha|year=1982|page=244}}</ref>\nFilm companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of [[Kadokawa Pictures]], or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting [[pink film]] industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.\n\n[[File:Nakadai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]]]\n\n[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'\u00c9tat]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.\n\nIn 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.\n\n[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)|The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Sh\u014dhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).\n\n''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.\n\nOf the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. [[Shohei Imamura]] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1983). [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made ''[[A Promise (1986 film)|A Promise]]'' (1986), his first film since 1973's ''Coup d'\u00c9tat''.\n\n[[File:1992 Juzo Itami.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Juzo Itami]]]]\n\nNew directors who appeared in the 80s include actor [[Juzo Itami]], who directed his first film, ''[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]'', in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with ''[[Tampopo]]'' in 1985. [[Shinji S\u014dmai]], an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused [[Typhoon Club (film)| Typhoon Club]], and the critically acclaimed Roman porno [[Love Hotel (1985 film)| Love Hotel]] among others. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1985. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.\n\n[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.\n\n===1990s===\n\nBecause of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.\n\n[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sh\u014dhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sj\u00f6berg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997). [[Takashi Miike]] launched a prolific career with titles such as ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'' (1999), ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Bird People in China]]'' (1998). Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).\n\nHayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;\u2013 which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing film in Japan]]&nbsp;\u2013 and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).\n\nSeveral new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]\n\nThe number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be \"Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age\", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.<ref name=\"Kehr\">Dave Kehr, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.</ref>\n\nAlthough not a commercial success, ''[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]'' directed by [[Shunji Iwai]] was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' and directed and starred in ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' and ''[[Zatoichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]''. Several horror films, ''[[Kairo (film)|Kairo]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Yogen]]'', [[Ju-on|the ''Grudge'' series]] and ''[[One Missed Call (2004 film)|One Missed Call]]'' met with commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', directed by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director [[Seijun Suzuki]] made his 56th film, ''[[Princess Raccoon]]''. [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films ''[[Distance (2001 film)|Distance]]'' and ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]''. Female film director [[Naomi Kawase]]'s film ''[[The Mourning Forest]]'' won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. [[Yoji Yamada]], director of the [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]] series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's ''[[Twilight Samurai]]'', followed by ''[[The Hidden Blade]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Love and Honor (2006 film)|Love and Honor]]'' in 2006.\n\nIn anime, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] directed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards\u2014including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] in 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|title=The 75th Academy Awards (2003)|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|url-status=live|accessdate=December 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128072357/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|archivedate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\u2014followed by ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Ponyo]]'' in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film ''[[The Sky Crawlers]]'' was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', ''[[Tokyo Godfathers]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]''. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] released ''[[Steamboy]]'', his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]'', in 2004. In collaboration with [[Studio 4C]], American director [[Michael Arias]] released ''[[Tekkon Kinkreet]]'' in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, [[Hideaki Anno]] formed [[Studio Khara|his own production studio]] and revisited his still-popular ''Evangelion'' franchise with the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.\n\nIn February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government&nbsp;\u2013 on both the national and local levels&nbsp;\u2013 must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.\n\n===2010s===\n\nFour films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: ''[[Caterpillar (2010 film)|Caterpillar]]'' by [[K\u014dji Wakamatsu]] was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] and won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]], ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' by [[Takeshi Kitano]] was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Himizu (film)|Himizu]]'' by [[Sion Sono]] was in competition for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 2011, [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai]]'' was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], the first [[3D film]] ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence]]'' and '' [[Taboo (1999 film)|Taboo]]'', [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'', and Miike's ''[[13 Assassins (2010 film)|13 Assassins]]'' onto the international stage as producer.\n\nIn 2018, [[Hirokazu Kore-Eda]] won the Palme d'Or for his movie ''[[Shoplifters (film)|Shoplifters]]'' at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|71st Cannes Film Festival]], a festival that also featured [[Ry\u016bsuke Hamaguchi]]'s ''[[Asako I & II]]'' in competition.\n\n==Genres==\n\nGenres of Japanese film include:{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n* '''[[Jidaigeki]]''': period pieces set during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) or earlier.\n** '''[[Samurai cinema]]''', a subgenre of ''jidaigeki'', also known as ''chambara'' ([[onomatopoeia]] describing the sound of swords clashing).\n* '''[[Japanese horror|Horror]]''': [[horror film]]s such as ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''\n* '''[[Tokusatsu]]'''\n** '''[[Kaiju]]''': [[monster]] films, such as ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''\n* '''[[Pink film]]s''': [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] [[pornographic film]]s.\n* '''[[Yakuza film]]s''': films about [[Yakuza]] mobsters.\n* '''[[Gendaigeki]]''': the opposite of \"jidaigeki\", films set in the present day.\n* '''[[Shomingeki]]''': realistic films about common working people\n* '''[[Anime]]''': [[Animation]].

Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products]], a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]].

The property covers nearly {{convert|25000|acre|sqmi km2|0}}, of which only half has been used.<ref name=\"Fun Facts\">{{Cite  news|url=http://wdwnews.com/fact-sheets/2014/10/31/walt-disney-world-fun-facts/|title=Walt Disney World Fun Facts|work=Walt Disney World News |language=en-us |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> The resort comprises four [[Amusement park|theme parks]] (consisting of [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Epcot]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]), two [[water park]]s, 27 themed [[resort|resort hotels]], nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center [[Disney Springs]].\n\nDesigned to supplement [[Disneyland]], in [[Anaheim, California]], which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by [[Walt Disney]] in the 1960s. \"The Florida Project\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \"[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]\" (EPCOT), a [[planned community]] intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex.  After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disneyworld project to fruition. Walt's older brother, Roy, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized, (construction started in 1967) but without Walt spearheading the construction, the company built a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. [[Magic Kingdom]] was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by [[Epcot]] (1982), [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (1989), and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] (1998).  It was Roy who insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disneyworld, to Walt Disney World, ensuring that people would remember that the project was Walt's dream.\n\nIn 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.<ref name=\"2018 Report\"/> The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a [[Popular culture|popular staple]] in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].\n\nOn March 15, 2020, Walt Disney World closed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the [[Mississippi River]], where 75% of the population of the United States lived.

Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in [[Magic Kingdom]]. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \"outs\". They were {{convert|5|acre|4=0|adj=on|spell=in}} lots [[plat]]ted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly [[swamp]] at the time. Another issue was the [[mineral rights]] to the land, which were owned by [[Tufts University]]. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=Realityland: True-Life Adventures at Walt Disney World|last=Koenig|first=David|year=2007|publisher=Bonaventure Press|location=Irvine, CA|isbn=978-0-9640605-2-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25 25\u201326]|ref=Koenig07|url=https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25}}</ref>\n\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties.

Bavar later described that Disney \"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\" before denying the story.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the ''Sentinel'' published another article headlined, \"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\".<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/>\n\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the ''Sentinel'' story, Disney asked Florida Governor [[Haydon Burns]] to confirm the story on October 25.

His brother and business partner, [[Roy O. Disney]], postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\n\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in [[Winter Park, Florida]]. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] with two cities inside it, [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and Reedy Creek, now [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]]. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be [[property tax]]es and [[elevator]] inspections.<ref name=\"married\"/> The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor [[Claude R.

Twenty-four days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \"Walt Disney World\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \"Everyone has heard of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars. But have they all heard of [[Henry Ford]], who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]], what she thought of Walt Disney World.

The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which opened in 1982 (renamed [[Epcot|EPCOT]] in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a [[world's fair]] than a \"community of tomorrow\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe.

Arrests and citations are issued by the [[Florida Highway Patrol]] along with the [[Orange County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Orange County]] and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers.

Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \"[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]\" (EPCOT), a [[planned community]] intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex.  After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disneyworld project to fruition. Walt's older brother, Roy, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized, (construction started in 1967) but without Walt spearheading the construction, the company built a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. [[Magic Kingdom]] was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by [[Epcot]] (1982), [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (1989), and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] (1998).  It was Roy who insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disneyworld, to Walt Disney World, ensuring that people would remember that the project was Walt's dream.\n\nIn 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.<ref name=\"2018 Report\"/> The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a [[Popular culture|popular staple]] in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].\n\nOn March 15, 2020, Walt Disney World closed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] with two cities inside it, [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and Reedy Creek, now [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]]. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be [[property tax]]es and [[elevator]] inspections.<ref name=\"married\"/> The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor [[Claude R. Kirk, Jr.]] on May 12, 1967.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Bob|title=Walt Disney - An American Original|date=1994|url=http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/ |page=357 |accessdate=September 21, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024034807/http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/|archivedate=October 24, 2015}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of Florida]] then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\n\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Resort|Polynesian Village]] were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.<ref name=\"dwfonfr\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0-4eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6996%2C2342976 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |agency=UPI |title=Disney World Florida opens next Friday |date=September 27, 1971 |page=11}}</ref><ref name=\"opfgteslns\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SsEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=izIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=7198%2C139625 |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |location=California |agency=UPI |title=Walt Disney World opens Florida gates |date=October 2, 1971 |page=10 }}</ref> The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground|Fort Wilderness]] opened one month later. Twenty-four days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \"Walt Disney World\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \"Everyone has heard of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars. But have they all heard of [[Henry Ford]], who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]], what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \"I think Walt would have approved.\" Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.<ref name=\"bbroydsn\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IkVQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yFcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5417%2C1489507 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Independent |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title=Backstage brain Roy Disney dies |date=December 21, 1971 |page=10\u2013A }}</ref>\n\nAdmission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and one dollar for children under twelve.<ref name=dwfonfr/>\n\n===1980s - present===\nMuch of Walt Disney's plans for his [[EPCOT (concept)|Progress City]] were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which opened in 1982 (renamed [[Epcot|EPCOT]] in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a [[world's fair]] than a \"community of tomorrow\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]] much later. The resort's third theme park, [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], opened in 1998.\n\n[[George Kalogridis]] was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing [[Meg Crofton]], who had overseen the site since 2006.\n\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. [[Disney Springs]] and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pedicini|first1=Sandra|title=Walt Disney World announces management reorganization|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-disney-overhauls-management-20160122-story.html |date=January 22, 2016 |accessdate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827045305/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-disney-overhauls-management-20160122-story.html|archivedate=August 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors could bring dogs to [[Disney's Yacht Club Resort]], [[Disney's Port Orleans Resort]] \u2013 Riverside, [[Disney's Art of Animation Resort]] and [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trejos|first1=Nancy|title=Dogs now welcome at Disney World resorts|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2017/10/18/pets-now-welcome-disney-world-resorts/774803001/|work=USA Today |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, [[Josh D'Amaro]] replaced [[George Kalogridis]] as President of the resort.

The system's three lines connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-gondola-cost-20180124-story.html|title=Disney's gondola system picks up $3.8 million worth of electrical work|last=Russon|first=Gabrielle|work=Orlando Sentinel |language=en-US |access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from [[water taxi]]s, up to the [[Ferry|ferries]] that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center.

Since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], uniformed security has been stationed outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks. Starting April 3, 2017, bag checkpoints have been placed at Magic Kingdom's resort monorail entryways and the Transportation and Ticket Center's ferry entry points prior to embarkation as well as the walkway from Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guests arriving the Transportation and Ticket Center by tram or tour bus will be screened at the former tram boarding areas. Guests arriving by Disney Resort hotel bus or [[Disney Transport#Minnie Van|Minnie Van\u2122]] have their own bag check just outside the bus stops. Guests arriving via Magic Kingdom Resort boat launch will be bag checked on the arrival dock outside Magic Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/news/03apr2017-photos---new-bag-check-areas-greatly-enhance-magic-kingdom-arrival-experience.htm |title=New bag check areas greatly enhance Magic Kingdom arrival experience |publisher=Walt Disney World |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney. RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services. The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company. Arrests and citations are issued by the [[Florida Highway Patrol]] along with the [[Orange County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Orange County]] and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.<ref name=\"married 2\">{{cite book|last=Foglesong|first=Richard E. |title=Married to the Mouse|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003|pages=69,139|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Florida Supreme Court|others=Alabama.

Disney and the Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \"night watchman\" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws. An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pastor\n|first=James F. |title=Security Law and Methods|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2006|pages=505\u2013512|isbn=978-0-7506-7994-7}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances.

It is common for a corporation to rent entire parks for the evening. In such cases, special passes are issued which are valid for admission to all rides and attractions. At the ticket booths and on published schedules, the guests are notified of the early closures. Then, cast members announce that the parks are closing, sometime before the private event starts, and clear the parks of guests who do not have the special passes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Disney theme park attractions]]\n*[[List of Disney attractions that were never built]]\n* [[Walt Disney World Company]]\n* [[Walt Disney Travel Company]]\n* [[Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation]]\n* [[Disney College Program]]\n* [[Incidents at Walt Disney World]]\n* [[Rail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]\n* [[Walt Disney World Casting Center]]\n* ''[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]''\n* [[Walt Disney World International Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Subject bar |book=Walt Disney World Resort| commons= Category:Walt Disney World Resort|d=Q206859|d-search=Q206859 |voy=Walt Disney World|n=Walt Disney World|portal1=Disney |portal3=Florida |portal4=Trains |portal5=Transport |portal6=Animals}}\n{{Walt Disney World}}\n{{WDW Resorts}}\n{{Disney Parks, Experiences and Products}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1971 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:Amusement parks in Greater Orlando]]\n[[Category:Amusement parks opened in 1971]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Osceola County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Resorts in Florida]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Orange County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Osceola County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney World| ]]\n", "name_user": "Invisiblechameleon", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World"}
