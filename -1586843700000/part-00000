The [[Missoula Floods]] had one of their outlets at Trinidad, close to Quincy and another near Ancient Lakes, which includes the [[Ancient Lakes of the Columbia Valley AVA]]. [[Glacial erratic]]s carried from as far away as Montana can be found nearby. The area also has an abundance of [[rimrock]].\n\n===Pre-American history===\n\n===Great Northern Railway===\nQuincy was founded as a railroad camp during construction of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in 1892, and was incorporated on March 27, 1907. It was named after [[Quincy, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=24964|title=Profile for Quincy, Washington|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=May 28,

The area offers boating, water skiing, hunting, fishing, snow skiing, and concerts.  The [[Gorge Amphitheatre]] brings a variety of people through the Quincy Valley.\n\nQuincy has several parks including an [[aqua park]] with a [[waterslide]] with 2 water fed half tubes, heated pools, and special areas for kids. The park is also home to a large field with a baseball diamond, playground, picnic area, and small skate-park.\n\nEvery 2nd Saturday in September, Quincy celebrates Farmer-Consumer Awareness Day. For a month beforehand, the roads leading to town are decorated with signs showing local crops and products made with them. On the day of the celebration, floats created by local schools and farm equipment parade through town. Free agricultural and geology tours are offered, as well as a produce sale, tractor pull, Farm-to-Market fun run, and many other activities.\n\nQuincy celebrated its [[centennial]] in 2007.\n\nQuincy High School won the 2A State Baseball Championship in 1998 and the 1A State Soccer Championship in 2014. In 2005, the Boys Basketball team took second in state. Every year Quincy has an annual Dru Gimlin 3 on 3 basketball tournament.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Farming===\nQuincy has long had an agricultural economy, which was enhanced by irrigation made possible with the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. Major crops include potatoes, wheat, and timothy grass.\n\nOrchards and vineyards are also displacing lower-value crops in the Quincy Valley. Washington State is a large grower of apples.\n\n===Technology===\nTechnology companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Dell]] and [[Intuit]] have located large [[data center]]s within the Quincy area since 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Ashley |date=November 11, 2015 |title=This tiny town in Central Washington is home to some of the biggest tech companies.

Quincy sees an uptick in population during concerts. Quincy was previously home to Tacos mi Pueblo, one of the most sought-after Mexican restaurants in the area.\n\nThe semi-arid climate allows Quincy to go for weeks or months without rain during the summer. This makes nearby water recreation such as Crescent Bar a major draw.

With a budget of $140 million, it is [[List of most expensive animated films#Traditionally animated films|the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made]].\n\nThe film was co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], who had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the concept for the film at the same time that they pitched another Disney animated feature, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989). ''Treasure Planet'' features the voices of [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Martin Short]],  [[Roscoe Lee Browne]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Patrick McGoohan]] (in his final film role). The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], while a couple of songs were written and performed by [[John Rzeznik]]. Despite generally positive critical reception from most critics and audiences praising the imaginative sci-fi visuals, animation, storyline, action scenes, voice performances, and music score, [[box office bomb|it failed at the box office]], costing $140 million to create while earning $38 million in the United States and Canada and just shy of $110 million worldwide.<ref name=\"bomojo\"/> It was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the planet Montressor, a young [[Jim Hawkins (character)#Disney version|Jim Hawkins]] is enchanted by stories of the legendary [[Space pirate|pirate]] [[Captain Flint|Captain Nathaniel Flint]] and his ability to appear from out of nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious \"Treasure Planet\". Twelve years later, having been abandoned by his father at a young age, Jim has grown into an aloof and isolated troublemaker. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from \"Alponian solar cruising\", [[skysurfing]] atop a rocket-powered sailboard.\n\nOne day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, [[Billy Bones]], gives Jim a [[sphere]] and tells him to \"beware the [[cyborg]]\". After this, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn to the ground while Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim finds that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map that leads to the location of Treasure Planet. Despite Sarah's reluctance, Jim and Doppler decide to travel to Treasure Planet in order to gain the funds to rebuild the inn.\n\nDoppler commissions a ship called the RLS ''Legacy'', on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined [[Chief Mate|first mate]], Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship.\n\nDuring the voyage, the ship encounters a [[supernova]]. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves into a [[black hole]] and Mr. Arrow is shortly sucked into it to his death. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless [[insectoid]] crew member named Scroop.\n\nAs the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a [[mutiny]] erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has accidentally left the map behind. Thinking Jim has the map, Silver targets him, but hesitates, allowing them to escape. The fugitives are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia.\n\nWhile exploring Treasure Planet's forests, they soon meet [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)#Other media|B.E.N.]], an abandoned navigational robot, who has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place for shelter. The pirates corner the group there; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them and after a scuffle with Jim, he but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.\n\nSilver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens into any location in the [[universe]], which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a [[space station]] built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty-handed, Silver attempts to escape on a boat loaded with treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim's life. The survivors escape to the ship, but it gets damaged and is unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the destruction.\n\nJim finds Silver has snuck below decks to escape. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him some part of the treasure he managed to save before the planet exploded to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will \"rattle the stars\". Amelia offers Jim a recommendation to Interstellar Academy before he returns to the spaceport to reunite with his mother. Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim has become a military cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]], an adolescent pining for adventure.\n**Austin Majors as Young Jim Hawkins\n* [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]] as [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], a cyborg who leads the mutiny on the RLS ''Legacy''.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Dr. Delbert Doppler, an anthropomorphic dog, and astronomer.

The \"mentor figures\" for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as \"one is more comic and the other's very straight\"; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler.

To ensure \"solidity\" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" />\n\nWhen asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of ''Treasure Island'' for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to \"clear his mind of stereotypes\", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom he \"loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.\" For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited [[James Dean]] as an important reference because \"there was a whole attitude, a posture\" wherein \"you felt the pain and the youthful innocence\", and he also cited the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' because \"there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.\"<ref name=\"p9keaneandripa\">{{cite web|title=TREASURE PLANET Q&A with animators JOHN KEANE & JOHN RIPA |publisher=Phase 9 Entertainment |year=2005 |url=http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-glenkeane&johnripa1.shtml |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113020003/http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq%26a-glenkeane%26johnripa1.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-13}}</ref>\n\nAnimators also used [[maquette]]s, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be \"like a mannequin in a store\", but rather has to be \"something that tells you [the character's] personality\" and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.<ref name=\"maquettes\">{{cite video | people =Kent Melton, Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Maquettes | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe animators took ''Deep Canvas'', a technology which they had initially developed for ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), and came up with a process they called \"Virtual Sets,\" wherein they created entire 360 [[Degree (angle)|degree]] sets before they began staging the scenes.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" /> They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a \"painted image with depth perception\" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film.<ref name=\"techtreasure\" /> In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of [[Captain Hook]] from [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|''Peter Pan'']] (1953) and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.<ref>{{cite video | people =Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The \"Hook\" Test | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation === <!--Some SPER by [[Special:Contributions/Lizley|Lizley]]-->\nOne of the film's goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point you could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the Treasure Plant, there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film. The traditional 2D character animation that Disney is known for, three-dimensional character animation, and the computer-generated or CG environments.\n\n===Audio===\nThis \"70/30 Law\" of \"70% traditional and 30% sci-fi\" was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer [[Dane Davis]] mentioned that he and his team \"scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms\" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to \"avoid sounding slick or sci-fi\". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried \"affected his comedy\", and \"the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances\".<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web|last=Droney |first=Maureen |title=Avast and Away! |work=Mix Magazine |date=January 1, 2003 |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |accessdate=2008-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043304/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |archivedate=March 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (\"[[I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)|I'm Still Here]]\" and \"Always Know Where You Are\") from [[The Goo Goo Dolls]] [[frontman]] [[John Rzeznik]] and British pop-rock group, [[BBMak]].

With a budget of $140 million, it is [[List of most expensive animated films#Traditionally animated films|the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made]].\n\nThe film was co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], who had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the concept for the film at the same time that they pitched another Disney animated feature, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989). ''Treasure Planet'' features the voices of [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Martin Short]],  [[Roscoe Lee Browne]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Patrick McGoohan]] (in his final film role). The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], while a couple of songs were written and performed by [[John Rzeznik]]. Despite generally positive critical reception from most critics and audiences praising the imaginative sci-fi visuals, animation, storyline, action scenes, voice performances, and music score, [[box office bomb|it failed at the box office]], costing $140 million to create while earning $38 million in the United States and Canada and just shy of $110 million worldwide.<ref name=\"bomojo\"/> It was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the planet Montressor, a young [[Jim Hawkins (character)#Disney version|Jim Hawkins]] is enchanted by stories of the legendary [[Space pirate|pirate]] [[Captain Flint|Captain Nathaniel Flint]] and his ability to appear from out of nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious \"Treasure Planet\". Twelve years later, having been abandoned by his father at a young age, Jim has grown into an aloof and isolated troublemaker. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from \"Alponian solar cruising\", [[skysurfing]] atop a rocket-powered sailboard.\n\nOne day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, [[Billy Bones]], gives Jim a [[sphere]] and tells him to \"beware the [[cyborg]]\". After this, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn to the ground while Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim finds that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map that leads to the location of Treasure Planet. Despite Sarah's reluctance, Jim and Doppler decide to travel to Treasure Planet in order to gain the funds to rebuild the inn.\n\nDoppler commissions a ship called the RLS ''Legacy'', on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined [[Chief Mate|first mate]], Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship.\n\nDuring the voyage, the ship encounters a [[supernova]]. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves into a [[black hole]] and Mr. Arrow is shortly sucked into it to his death. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless [[insectoid]] crew member named Scroop.\n\nAs the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a [[mutiny]] erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has accidentally left the map behind. Thinking Jim has the map, Silver targets him, but hesitates, allowing them to escape. The fugitives are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia.\n\nWhile exploring Treasure Planet's forests, they soon meet [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)#Other media|B.E.N.]], an abandoned navigational robot, who has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place for shelter. The pirates corner the group there; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them and after a scuffle with Jim, he but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.\n\nSilver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens into any location in the [[universe]], which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a [[space station]] built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty-handed, Silver attempts to escape on a boat loaded with treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim's life. The survivors escape to the ship, but it gets damaged and is unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the destruction.\n\nJim finds Silver has snuck below decks to escape. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him some part of the treasure he managed to save before the planet exploded to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will \"rattle the stars\". Amelia offers Jim a recommendation to Interstellar Academy before he returns to the spaceport to reunite with his mother. Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim has become a military cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]], an adolescent pining for adventure.\n**Austin Majors as Young Jim Hawkins\n* [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]] as [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], a cyborg who leads the mutiny on the RLS ''Legacy''.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Dr. Delbert Doppler, an anthropomorphic dog, and astronomer.

The \"mentor figures\" for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as \"one is more comic and the other's very straight\"; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler.

To ensure \"solidity\" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" />\n\nWhen asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of ''Treasure Island'' for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to \"clear his mind of stereotypes\", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom he \"loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.\" For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited [[James Dean]] as an important reference because \"there was a whole attitude, a posture\" wherein \"you felt the pain and the youthful innocence\", and he also cited the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' because \"there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.\"<ref name=\"p9keaneandripa\">{{cite web|title=TREASURE PLANET Q&A with animators JOHN KEANE & JOHN RIPA |publisher=Phase 9 Entertainment |year=2005 |url=http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-glenkeane&johnripa1.shtml |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113020003/http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq%26a-glenkeane%26johnripa1.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-13}}</ref>\n\nAnimators also used [[maquette]]s, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be \"like a mannequin in a store\", but rather has to be \"something that tells you [the character's] personality\" and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.<ref name=\"maquettes\">{{cite video | people =Kent Melton, Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Maquettes | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe animators took ''Deep Canvas'', a technology which they had initially developed for ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), and came up with a process they called \"Virtual Sets,\" wherein they created entire 360 [[Degree (angle)|degree]] sets before they began staging the scenes.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" /> They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a \"painted image with depth perception\" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film.<ref name=\"techtreasure\" /> In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of [[Captain Hook]] from [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|''Peter Pan'']] and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.<ref>{{cite video | people =Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The \"Hook\" Test | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date = 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation === <!--Some SPER by [[Special:Contributions/Lizley|Lizley]]-->\nOne of the film's goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point you could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the Treasure Plant, there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film. The traditional 2D character animation that Disney is known for, three-dimensional character animation, and the computer-generated or CG environments.\n\n===Audio===\nThis \"70/30 Law\" of \"70% traditional and 30% sci-fi\" was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer [[Dane Davis]] mentioned that he and his team \"scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms\" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to \"avoid sounding slick or sci-fi\". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried \"affected his comedy\", and \"the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances\".<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web|last=Droney |first=Maureen |title=Avast and Away! |work=Mix Magazine |date=January 1, 2003 |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |accessdate=2008-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043304/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |archivedate=March 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (\"[[I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)|I'm Still Here]]\" and \"Always Know Where You Are\") from [[The Goo Goo Dolls]] [[frontman]] [[John Rzeznik]] and British pop-rock group, [[BBMak]].

PFN was one of the pioneers of the film industry in Indonesia when it was formed.\n\nPFN originated from the Java Pacific Film (JPF) company founded by Albert Balink in Batavia. JPF underwent several name changes before finally becoming PFN in 1975.\n\n\nTable of contents\n1 History\n1.1 Early days\n1.2 Post Indonesian independence\n2 Summary of the development of PFN\n3 Inheritance of the country\n4 Logo gallery\n5 Filmography\n6 Awards\n7 References\n8 External links\nHistory edit source]\nEarly days [edit | edit source]\nThe formation of the PFN company began with the founding of a film company by Albert Balink in 1934 called Java Pacific Film. Java Pacific Film was separated from the Colonial Institute or the Colonial Institute which in 1919 produced the film \"Onze Oost\" or \"Our Eastern\". The birth of the Java Pacific Film coincided with the formation of the Nederlandsch Indiche Bioscoopbond (Association of Indian Cinemas) and the Film Committee (the forerunner to the Film Censorship Institution). In 1936 the name Java Pacific Film changed to Algemeene Nederlands Indiesche Film (ANIF). This company focuses on making story films and documentaries.\n\nThe Japanese occupation period in Indonesia in 1942 was accompanied by the expropriation of all wealth under the control of the Dutch East Indies by the Japanese, one of which was ANIF. From the assets of the ANIF company the Japanese Imperial Army then founded a film company called Nippon ii Eiga Sha under Sendenbu's supervision. The film produced by Nippon Eiga Sha is generally intended as a tool for Japanese political propaganda as a unifier of Asia.\n\nNippon Eiga Sha was founded in April 1943 by the Japanese occupation government in Jakarta. Indigenous-Archipelago workers who work in the company are Raden Mas Soetarto, who has experience in film and was appointed as a cameraman; he became the first Indigenous-Archipelago in the position. When Nippon Eiga Sha was established, Soetarto was appointed by Japan as the company's vice chairman and concurrently the Chairperson of Indonesian Employees and cameramen.\n\nAfter Indonesian independence [edit | edit source]\nEntering the era of independence, the company was handed over to the Indonesian government. Along with these steps, company employees covered a variety of historical events, and changed to Indonesian Film News (abbreviated BFI) on October 6, 1945. [1] BFI) is the first filmmaking institution owned by the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nOne and a half months after the proclamation of Indonesian independence, Soetarto initiated the takeover of Nippon Eiga Sha from his leader, T. Ishimoto, with the knowledge of the then Minister of Information, Amir Sjarifuddin. Because Jakarta was no longer safe due to attacks by Allied fighter, in December 1945 BFI was evacuated to Surakarta. Before moving on, BFI still had time to film the day of the proclamation, posters, writing on the walls, a giant meeting on September 19 in Ikada Square, Japanese disarmament by the Allies, and the transport of Japanese soldiers to Galang Island and the Indonesian Youth Congress in Yogyakarta, November 1945 .\n\nAfter being abandoned by BFI, the studio in Polonia Jatinegara, Jakarta, was used by the NICA army for propaganda purposes with the establishment of the Film Bedrijf Regerings (Government Film Company). In addition, the studio was also used by NV Multi Film together with South Pacific Film Co. Because of the recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, the Dutch then handed over the Regrings Film Bedrijf assets to the Republic of Indonesia. The company got a new name: the State Pilem Company (PPN) under the auspices of the Ministry of Information. The first PPN leader is Suska. At the end of 1950, RM Harjoto was appointed as Director and RM Soetarto as Head of General Production, which included story production, documentary films and laboratories. BFI employees in Yogyakarta moved back to Jakarta, and together with former Regriings Film Bedrijf employees joined the PPN which was renamed the State Film Company (PFN). [2]\n\nSummary of the development of PFN [edit | edit source]\nThe development of the PFN Public Corporation, as described in the previous section, began with the formation of BFI which was motivated by the movement of film employees working for Nippon Eiga Sha.

He won ''[[The Sporting News]]'' Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award in 1988 for the [[National League]]. He was also the [[pitching coach]] for the [[Cleveland Indians]].\n\n==Career==\nDuring his 14-year baseball career, Belcher pitched from 1987\u20132000 for seven different ballclubs: the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1987\u20131991), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1992\u20131993), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1993), [[Detroit Tigers]] (1994), [[Seattle Mariners]] (1995), [[Kansas City Royals]] (1996\u20131998), and [[Anaheim Angels]] (1999\u20132000).\n\nBelcher played high school baseball at [[Highland High School (Sparta, Ohio)|Highland High School]] and intercollegiate varsity baseball at [[Mount Vernon Nazarene University|Mount Vernon Nazarene College]] in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]]. He was the first draft pick in the [[1983 Major League Baseball Draft]], selected by the [[Minnesota Twins]]. However, he refused to sign with the Twins, and instead was selected in the 1984 supplemental draft by the [[New York Yankees]]. He was picked up by the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the compensation pool.\n\nAfter climbing through the A's system to [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]], he was traded to Los Angeles on September 3, 1987, as the \"player to be named later\" in the [[Rick Honeycutt]] transaction. He made his MLB debut on September 6 as a Dodger.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tim Belcher Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac|url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=belchti01|website = www.baseball-almanac.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Belcher was a member of the 1988 Dodgers team that won the [[World Series]], defeating the [[Oakland Athletics]]. Belcher won one game in the World Series after winning twice in the [[National League Championship Series]]. The next year he led the National League with 10 complete games and MLB with eight shutouts \u2013 the most since [[Roger Clemens]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] the previous year, while placing in the top ten in wins and ERA. He was the last starting pitcher in the majors to have more than five shutouts, until 2011, when [[Cliff Lee]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] had six on the season.\n\nHowever, his stay in Los Angeles proved brief, as he was traded to the Reds in 1991 as a part of the [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] multi-player transaction. He tied a career high with 15 wins for the Reds, but was dealt again, this time to the White Sox in the middle of the 1993 season at the trading deadline. He won Game Four of the [[American League Championship Series]] in relief against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Filing for free agency, he signed with the Tigers for 1994, but led the American League in losses with 15 that strike-shortened year.\n\nHe returned in 1995 to the Reds on a one-year minor-league contract, but was soon dealt by them a second time, this time in May to the Mariners. [[New York Yankees]] superstar shortstop [[Derek Jeter]] got his first major league hit off Belcher in the [[Kingdome]] on May 30, 1995. At the end of the regular season, Belcher lost two post-season games, the only two playoff losses he suffered in his career; after Game 2 of the [[1995 American League Division Series]], he assaulted a cameraman in the locker room area for filming him after giving up a game-winning [[home run]] to Yankee [[catcher]] [[Jim Leyritz]]. Again becoming a free agent, he signed with the Royals for the 1996 season, spending the next three years with Kansas City and leading the team in wins each season.\n\nOn June 5, 1999, Belcher was involved in an on-field brawl at [[Dodger Stadium]]. At the time a member of the Anaheim Angels, Belcher was involved in an altercation with then-Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher [[Chan Ho Park]]. Park claimed that Belcher had tagged him too hard on the just-concluded play and asked him about the incident.

He won ''[[The Sporting News]]'' Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award in 1988 for the [[National League]]. He was also the [[pitching coach]] for the [[Cleveland Indians]].\n\n==Career==\nDuring his 14-year baseball career, Belcher pitched from 1987\u20132000 for seven different ballclubs: the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1987\u20131991), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1992\u20131993), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1993), [[Detroit Tigers]] (1994), [[Seattle Mariners]] (1995), [[Kansas City Royals]] (1996\u20131998), and [[Anaheim Angels]] (1999\u20132000).\n\nBelcher played high school baseball at [[Highland High School (Sparta, Ohio)|Highland High School]] and intercollegiate varsity baseball at [[Mount Vernon Nazarene University|Mount Vernon Nazarene College]] in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]]. He was the first draft pick in the [[1983 Major League Baseball Draft]], selected by the [[Minnesota Twins]]. However, he refused to sign with the Twins, and instead was selected in the 1984 supplemental draft by the [[New York Yankees]]. He was picked up by the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the compensation pool.\n\nAfter climbing through the A's system to [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]], he was traded to Los Angeles on September 3, 1987, as the \"player to be named later\" in the [[Rick Honeycutt]] transaction. He made his MLB debut on September 6 as a Dodger.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tim Belcher Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac|url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=belchti01|website = www.baseball-almanac.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Belcher was a member of the 1988 Dodgers team that won the [[World Series]], defeating the [[Oakland Athletics]]. Belcher won one game in the World Series after winning twice in the [[National League Championship Series]]. The next year he led the National League with 10 complete games and MLB with eight shutouts \u2013 the most since [[Roger Clemens]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] the previous year, while placing in the top ten in wins and ERA. He was the last starting pitcher in the majors to have more than five shutouts, until 2011, when [[Cliff Lee]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] had six on the season.\n\nHowever, his stay in Los Angeles proved brief, as he was traded to the Reds in 1991 as a part of the [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] multi-player transaction. He tied a career high with 15 wins for the Reds, but was dealt again, this time to the White Sox in the middle of the 1993 season at the trading deadline. He won Game Four of the [[American League Championship Series]] in relief against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Filing for free agency, he signed with the Tigers for 1994, but led the American League in losses with 15 that strike-shortened year.\n\nHe returned in 1995 to the Reds on a one-year minor-league contract, but was soon dealt by them a second time, this time in May to the Mariners. [[New York Yankees]] superstar shortstop [[Derek Jeter]] got his first major league hit off Belcher in the [[Kingdome]] on May 30, 1995. At the end of the regular season, Belcher lost two post-season games, the only two playoff losses he suffered in his career; after Game 2 of the [[1995 American League Division Series]], he assaulted a cameraman in the locker room area for filming him after giving up a game-winning [[home run]] to Yankee [[catcher]] [[Jim Leyritz]]. Again becoming a free agent, he signed with the Royals for the 1996 season, spending the next three years with Kansas City and leading the team in wins each season.\n\nOn June 5, 1999, Belcher was involved in an on-field brawl at [[Dodger Stadium]]. At the time a member of the Anaheim Angels, Belcher was involved in an altercation with then-Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher [[Chan Ho Park]]. Park claimed that Belcher had tagged him too hard on the just-concluded play and asked him about the incident. Belcher remarked with racist comments causing Park to kick him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/news/view.asp?seq=196308 |accessdate=May 29, 2014 |script-title=ko:\ubc15\ucc2c\ud638 \ubc1c\ucc28\uae30\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0? |publisher=Asia Today |date=January 4, 2009|language=Korean }}</ref>\n\nBelcher played his final game on September 30, 2000.
