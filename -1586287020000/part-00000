{"title_page": "Ahom dynasty", "text_new": "{{short description|Dynasty that ruled the Ahom kingdom in modern day Assam, India}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Ahom Dynasty}}\nThe '''Ahom dynasty''' (1228\u20131826) ruled the [[Ahom kingdom]] in present-day [[Assam, India]] for nearly 598 years.  The dynasty was established by [[Sukaphaa]], a [[Shan people|Shan]] prince of [[Mong Mao]] who came to Assam after crossing the [[Patkai]] mountains. The rule of this dynasty ended with the [[Burmese invasion of Assam]] and the subsequent annexation by the [[British East India Company]] following the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] in 1826.\n\nIn external medieval chronicles the kings of this dynasty were called ''Asam Raja'', whereas the subjects of the kingdom called them ''[[Saopha|Chaopha]]'' (''Chao''-ruler, ''Pha''-heaven), or ''Swargadeo'' (the equivalent in [[Assamese language|Assamese]]).\n\n== Chao-Pha ==\nThe office of the Ahom king, was reserved exclusively for the descendants of the first king [[Sukaphaa]] (1228\u20131268) who came to Assam from [[Mong Mao]] in 1228.<ref>See [[Sukaphaa]] for the origin and journey of the first Ahom king into Assam.</ref>  Succession was by [[primogeniture#Agnatic primogeniture|agnatic primogeniture]]. Nevertheless, following [[Rudra Singha]]'s deathbed injunction four of his five sons became the king one after the other.  The descendants of Sukaphaa were not eligible for ministerial positions&mdash;a division of power that was followed till the end of the dynasty and the kingdom.  When the nobles asked [[Atan Burhagohain]] to become the king, the Tai priests rejected the idea and he desisted from ascending the throne.\n\nThe king could be appointed only with the concurrence of the {{transl|ass|patra mantris}} (council of ministers&mdash;[[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]], [[Borpatrogohain]], [[Borbarua]] and [[Borphukan]]).  During three periods in the 14th century, the kingdom had no kings when acceptable candidates were not found.  The ministers could remove unacceptable kings, and it used to involve executing the erstwhile king.  In the 17th century a power struggle and the increasing number of claimants to the throne resulted in kings being deposed in quick succession, all of whom were executed after the new king was instated.  To prevent this bloody end, a new rule was introduced during the reign of Sulikphaa Lora Roja&mdash;claimants to the throne had to be physically unblemished&mdash;which meant that threats to the throne could be removed by merely slitting the ear of an ambitious prince.  Rudra Sinha, suspecting his brother Lechai's intention, mutilated and banished him.  The problem of succession remained, and on his deathbed he instructed that all his sons were to become kings. One of his sons, Mohanmala, was superseded, who went on to lead a rebel group during the [[Moamoria rebellion]].  The later kings and officers exploited the unblemished rule, leading to weak kings being instated.  [[Kamaleswar Singha]] (2-year-old son of Kadam Dighala) and Purandar Singha (10-year-old son of Brajanath and one of the last kings of this dynasty) came into office because their fathers were mutilated.\n\nThe Ahom kings were given divine origin. According to Ahom tradition, Sukaphaa was a descendant of Khunlung, the grandson of the king of the heavens Leungdon, who had come down from the heavens and ruled Mong-Ri-Mong-Ram.  During the reign of [[Suhungmung]] (1497\u20131539) which saw the composition of the first Assamese [[Buranji]] and increased Hindu influence, the Ahom kings were traced to Hindu lord [[Indra]] who  was identified with Ahom lord lengdon as both Lengdon and Indra were king of heaven,thus according to Hindu ved, Ahom were considered as the relatives of Indra and were declared ''Indravamsa [[kshatriya]]s'', a lineage created exclusively for the Ahoms.<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|1968|p=283}}.  In standard Hindu [[Purana|Puranic]] history the two accepted royal families are ''Chandravamsi'' and ''Suryavamsi''.</ref>  Suhungmung adopted the title ''Swarganarayan'', and the later kings were called Swargadeo's (Lord of the heavens).  It was during his reign that the [[Buranji]] titled ''Sri Sri Swarganarayan Maharajor Jonmokotha'' was written wherein the source and lineage of the Ahom kings was connected to the Hindu God, [[Indra]], Lord of the Heaven.\n\n===Coronation===\nThe Swargadeo's coronation was called [[Singarigharutha ceremony|Singarigharutha]], a ceremony that was performed first by [[Sudangphaa]], (''Bamuni Konwar'') (1397\u20131407).  This was the occasion when the first coins in the new king's name were minted.  [[Kamaleswar Singha]] (1795\u20131811) and [[Chandrakanta Singha]]'s (1811\u20131818) coronations were not performed on the advice of Prime minister Purnananda [[Burhagohain]], due to the financial constraints of State treasury caused by the internal disturbances during [[Moamoria rebellion]]. Kings who died in office were buried in vaults called [[Moidam]], at [[Charaideo]].  Some of the earlier Moidams were looted by [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]] in the 17th century, and are lost.  Some later kings, especially with [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1751\u20131769), who were cremated had their ashes buried instead.\n\nOn ascent, the king would generally assume an Ahom name decided by the Ahom priests.  The name generally ended in ''Pha'' ([[Ahom language|Tai]]: Lord), e.g. [[Susenghphaa]].  Later kings also assumed a Hindu name that ended in ''Singha'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]: Lion): Susengphaa assumed the name ''Pratap Singha''.  [[Buranji]]s occasionally would refer to a past king by a more informal and colorful name that focused on a specific aspect of the king.  [[Pratap Singha]] was also known as ''Burha Roja'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]: Old King) because when Pratap Singha became the king, he was quite advanced in age.\n\n===Royal offices===\nSubinphaa (1281\u20131293), the third Ahom king, delineated the ''Satghariya Ahom'', the Ahom aristocracy of the Seven Houses.  Of this, the first lineage was that of the king.  The next two were the lineages of the [[Burhagohain]] and the [[Borgohain]].  The last four were priestly lineages.  Sukhramphaa (1332\u20131364) established the position of Charing Raja which came to be reserved for the [[heir apparent]].  The first Charing Raja was Sukhramphaa's half-brother, Chao Pulai, the son of the Kamata princess Rajani, but who did not ultimately become the Swargadeo. [[Suhungmung]] ''Dihingia Raja'' (1497\u20131539) settled the descendants of past kings in different regions that gave rise to seven royal houses&mdash;''Saringiya'', ''Tipamiya'', ''Dihingiya'', ''Samuguriya'', ''[[Tungkhungia_Ahom_kings|Tungkhungiya]]'', ''Parvatiya'' and ''Namrupiya''&mdash;and periods of Ahom rule came to be known after these families.  The rule of the last such house, [[Tungkhungia Ahom kings|Tungkhungiya]], was established by [[Gadadhar Singha]] (1681\u20131696) and his descendants ruled till the end of the Ahom kingdom.\n\n===Queens===\nAhom queens (''Kunworis'') played important roles in the matter of state.  They were officially designated in a gradation of positions, called the ''Bor Kuwori'' (Chief Queen), ''Parvatia Kuwori'', ''Raidangia Kuwori'', ''Tamuli Kuwori'', etc. who were generally daughters of Ahom noblemen and high officials.  Lesser wives of the Swargadeo were called ''Chamua Kunworis''. Some of the queens were given separate estates that were looked after by state officials (Phukans or Baruas).<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|1968|pp=546\u2013547}}</ref>  During the reign of [[Siba Singha]] (1714\u20131744), the king gave his royal umbrella and royal insignia to his queens&mdash;Phuleshwari Kunwori, Ambika Kunwori and Anadari Kunwori in succession&mdash; to rule the kingdom.  They were called ''Bor-Rojaa''. Some queens maintained office even after the death or removal of the kings, as happened with Pakhori Gabhoru and Kuranganayani who were queens to multiple kings.\n\nOne way in which the importance of the queens can be seen is that many of them are named on coins; typically the king's name would be on the obverse of the coin and the queen's on the reverse.\n\n===Court influences===\nSukaphaa's ruling deity was ''Chum-Pha'' and ''Sheng-mung'' a pair of non-Hindu, non-Buddhist gods, and he was accompanied by classes of priests called ''Deodhai'', ''Bailung'' etc.  But the Ahom kings let themselves be influenced by the religion and customs of those they ruled over.  [[Sudangphaa]] ''Bamuni Konwar'' (1397\u20131407) installed a Brahmin of [[Habung]], in whose household he was born and raised, as his adviser, but he himself did not convert to Hinduism.<ref>{{harv|Gogoi|2006|p=64}}</ref> [[Susenphaa]] (1439\u20131488) constructed a temple at [[Negheriting Shiva Doul|Negheriting]].<ref name=\"gogi2006p65\">{{harv|Gogoi|2006|p=65}}</ref>  [[Suhungmung]] ''Dihingia Rojaa'' (1497\u20131539) was the first Ahom king to expand the kingdom and the polity, allow Assamese influence in his court and accept a non-Ahom title&mdash;''Swarganarayan''.<ref>{{harv|Gogoi|1968|p=283}}</ref>  [[Sukhaamphaa]] ''Khora Rojaa'' (1552\u20131603) began consulting Hindu astrologers alongside the traditional ''Deodhai-Bailung'' priests, and [[Pratap Singha]] (1603\u20131641) installed 13 Brahmin families as diplomats.<ref name=\"gogi2006p65\"/>  [[Assamese language]] coexisted with Tai language in the court till the reign of [[Pratap Singha]], during whose rule Assamese became dominant.  [[Sutamla]] (1648\u20131663) was the first Ahom king to be initiated into the [[Mahapuruxiya Dharma]],<ref>Sutamla accepted ''Ekasarana'' initiation in 1654. {{harv|Gogoi|1968|p=433}}</ref> and Ahom kings till Sulikphaa ''lora roja'' (1679\u20131681) continued to be disciples of one [[sattra]] or the other.<ref>{{harv|Gogoi|2006|p=66}}</ref> Mahapuruxiya pontiffs belonging to different sects began playing a greater role in state politics.  After the chaos of the late 17th century, [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Sinha]] (1681\u20131696), the first Tungkhungiya king began his rule with a deep distrust of these religious groups.  His son and successor [[Sukhrungphaa|Rudra Singha]] (1696\u20131714) searched for an alternative state religion, and his son and successor [[Sutanphaa|Siba Sinha]] (1714\u20131744) formally adopted [[Saktism]], the nemesis of the Mahapuruxiya sects.  The persecution of the Mahapuruxiya [[Sattra]]s under the Tunkhungiya rulers following Siba Singha was a crucial factor leading to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] that greatly depleted the Ahom kingdom.\n\n===King's Guards===\nThe king was guarded by a six thousand strong household troop under a ''Bhitarual Phukan''.  A unit of musketeers consisting of the king's relatives was established by Sukhamphaa Khora Raja that protected the capital (under the ''Bajua Hilaidari Konwar'') and the palace and environs (''Bhitarual Hilaidari Konwar'').<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=19}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:1000px height:auto barincrement:11px\nPlotArea   = left:0 bottom:50px top:0

39-Swargadeo dynastic history, there are three progenitor kings (all subsequent kings are descendants of these kings).  They are [[Sukaphaa]], who established the kingdom; [[Suhungmung]], who made the greatest territorial and political expansion of the kingdom; and [[Supaatphaa]], who established the House of [[Tungkhungia Ahom kings|Tungkhugia king]]s that reigned the kingdom during its political and cultural zenith, as well as the period of decay and end (except for [[Jogeswar Singha]], who was a descendant of Supaatphaa's father [[Gobar Roja|Gobar]], and who was installed as a puppet king by the Burmese).\n\nThe dynastic history and dates that are accepted today are the result of a re-examination of Ahom and other documents by a team of Nora astronomers and experts who were commissioned to do so by Gaurinath Singha (1780\u20131795).<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|1968|pp=534\u2013535}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The list of Swargadeos of the [[Ahom Kingdom]]\n|-\n!

The dynasty was established by [[Sukaphaa]], a [[Shan people|Shan]] prince of [[Mong Mao]] who came to Assam after crossing the [[Patkai]] mountains. The rule of this dynasty ended with the [[Burmese invasion of Assam]] and the subsequent annexation by the [[British East India Company]] following the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] in 1826.\n\nIn external medieval chronicles the kings of this dynasty were called ''Asam Raja'', whereas the subjects of the kingdom called them ''[[Saopha|Chaopha]]'' (''Chao''-ruler, ''Pha''-heaven), or ''Swargadeo'' (the equivalent in [[Assamese language|Assamese]]).\n\n== Chao-Pha ==\nThe office of the Ahom king, was reserved exclusively for the descendants of the first king [[Sukaphaa]] (1228\u20131268) who came to Assam from [[Mong Mao]] in 1228.<ref>See [[Sukaphaa]] for the origin and journey of the first Ahom king into Assam.</ref>  Succession was by [[primogeniture#Agnatic primogeniture|agnatic primogeniture]]. Nevertheless, following [[Rudra Singha]]'s deathbed injunction four of his five sons became the king one after the other.  The descendants of Sukaphaa were not eligible for ministerial positions&mdash;a division of power that was followed till the end of the dynasty and the kingdom.  When the nobles asked [[Atan Burhagohain]] to become the king, the Tai priests rejected the idea and he desisted from ascending the throne.\n\nThe king could be appointed only with the concurrence of the {{transl|ass|patra mantris}} (council of ministers&mdash;[[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]], [[Borpatrogohain]], [[Borbarua]] and [[Borphukan]]).  During three periods in the 14th century, the kingdom had no kings when acceptable candidates were not found.  The ministers could remove unacceptable kings, and it used to involve executing the erstwhile king.  In the 17th century a power struggle and the increasing number of claimants to the throne resulted in kings being deposed in quick succession, all of whom were executed after the new king was instated.  To prevent this bloody end, a new rule was introduced during the reign of Sulikphaa Lora Roja&mdash;claimants to the throne had to be physically unblemished&mdash;which meant that threats to the throne could be removed by merely slitting the ear of an ambitious prince.  Rudra Sinha, suspecting his brother Lechai's intention, mutilated and banished him.  The problem of succession remained, and on his deathbed he instructed that all his sons were to become kings. One of his sons, Mohanmala, was superseded, who went on to lead a rebel group during the [[Moamoria rebellion]].  The later kings and officers exploited the unblemished rule, leading to weak kings being instated.  [[Kamaleswar Singha]] (2-year-old son of Kadam Dighala) and Purandar Singha (10-year-old son of Brajanath and one of the last kings of this dynasty) came into office because their fathers were mutilated.\n\nThe Ahom kings were given divine origin. According to Ahom tradition, Sukaphaa was a descendant of Khunlung, the grandson of the king of the heavens Leungdon, who had come down from the heavens and ruled Mong-Ri-Mong-Ram.  During the reign of [[Suhungmung]] (1497\u20131539) which saw the composition of the first Assamese [[Buranji]] and increased Hindu influence, the Ahom kings were traced to the union of [[Indra]] (identified with Lengdon) and Syama (a low-caste woman), and were declared ''Indravamsa [[kshatriya]]s'', a lineage created exclusively for the Ahoms.<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|1968|p=283}}.  In standard Hindu [[Purana|Puranic]] history the two accepted royal families are ''Chandravamsi'' and ''Suryavamsi''.</ref>  Suhungmung adopted the title ''Swarganarayan'', and the later kings were called Swargadeo's (Lord of the heavens).  It was during his reign that the [[Buranji]] titled ''Sri Sri Swarganarayan Maharajor Jonmokotha'' was written wherein the source and lineage of the Ahom kings was connected to the Hindu God, [[Indra]], Lord of the Heaven.\n\n===Coronation===\nThe Swargadeo's coronation was called [[Singarigharutha ceremony|Singarigharutha]], a ceremony that was performed first by [[Sudangphaa]], (''Bamuni Konwar'') (1397\u20131407).  This was the occasion when the first coins in the new king's name were minted.  [[Kamaleswar Singha]] (1795\u20131811) and [[Chandrakanta Singha]]'s (1811\u20131818) coronations were not performed on the advice of Prime minister Purnananda [[Burhagohain]], due to the financial constraints of State treasury caused by the internal disturbances during [[Moamoria rebellion]]. Kings who died in office were buried in vaults called [[Moidam]], at [[Charaideo]].  Some of the earlier Moidams were looted by [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]] in the 17th century, and are lost.  Some later kings, especially with [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1751\u20131769), who were cremated had their ashes buried instead.\n\nOn ascent, the king would generally assume an Ahom name decided by the Ahom priests.  The name generally ended in ''Pha'' ([[Ahom language|Tai]]: Lord), e.g. [[Susenghphaa]].  Later kings also assumed a Hindu name that ended in ''Singha'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]: Lion): Susengphaa assumed the name ''Pratap Singha''.  [[Buranji]]s occasionally would refer to a past king by a more informal and colorful name that focused on a specific aspect of the king.  [[Pratap Singha]] was also known as ''Burha Roja'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]: Old King) because when Pratap Singha became the king, he was quite advanced in age.\n\n===Royal offices===\nSubinphaa (1281\u20131293), the third Ahom king, delineated the ''Satghariya Ahom'', the Ahom aristocracy of the Seven Houses.  Of this, the first lineage was that of the king.  The next two were the lineages of the [[Burhagohain]] and the [[Borgohain]].  The last four were priestly lineages.  Sukhramphaa (1332\u20131364) established the position of Charing Raja which came to be reserved for the [[heir apparent]].  The first Charing Raja was Sukhramphaa's half-brother, Chao Pulai, the son of the Kamata princess Rajani, but who did not ultimately become the Swargadeo. [[Suhungmung]] ''Dihingia Raja'' (1497\u20131539) settled the descendants of past kings in different regions that gave rise to seven royal houses&mdash;''Saringiya'', ''Tipamiya'', ''Dihingiya'', ''Samuguriya'', ''[[Tungkhungia_Ahom_kings|Tungkhungiya]]'', ''Parvatiya'' and ''Namrupiya''&mdash;and periods of Ahom rule came to be known after these families.  The rule of the last such house, [[Tungkhungia Ahom kings|Tungkhungiya]], was established by [[Gadadhar Singha]] (1681\u20131696) and his descendants ruled till the end of the Ahom kingdom.\n\n===Queens===\nAhom queens (''Kunworis'') played important roles in the matter of state.  They were officially designated in a gradation of positions, called the ''Bor Kuwori'' (Chief Queen), ''Parvatia Kuwori'', ''Raidangia Kuwori'', ''Tamuli Kuwori'', etc. who were generally daughters of Ahom noblemen and high officials.  Lesser wives of the Swargadeo were called ''Chamua Kunworis''. Some of the queens were given separate estates that were looked after by state officials (Phukans or Baruas).<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|1968|pp=546\u2013547}}</ref>  During the reign of [[Siba Singha]] (1714\u20131744), the king gave his royal umbrella and royal insignia to his queens&mdash;Phuleshwari Kunwori, Ambika Kunwori and Anadari Kunwori in succession&mdash; to rule the kingdom.  They were called ''Bor-Rojaa''. Some queens maintained office even after the death or removal of the kings, as happened with Pakhori Gabhoru and Kuranganayani who were queens to multiple kings.\n\nOne way in which the importance of the queens can be seen is that many of them are named on coins; typically the king's name would be on the obverse of the coin and the queen's on the reverse.\n\n===Court influences===\nSukaphaa's ruling deity was ''Chum-Pha'' and ''Sheng-mung'' a pair of non-Hindu, non-Buddhist gods, and he was accompanied by classes of priests called ''Deodhai'', ''Bailung'' etc.  But the Ahom kings let themselves be influenced by the religion and customs of those they ruled over.  [[Sudangphaa]] ''Bamuni Konwar'' (1397\u20131407) installed a Brahmin of [[Habung]], in whose household he was born and raised, as his adviser, but he himself did not convert to Hinduism.<ref>{{harv|Gogoi|2006|p=64}}</ref> [[Susenphaa]] (1439\u20131488) constructed a temple at [[Negheriting Shiva Doul|Negheriting]].<ref name=\"gogi2006p65\">{{harv|Gogoi|2006|p=65}}</ref>  [[Suhungmung]] ''Dihingia Rojaa'' (1497\u20131539) was the first Ahom king to expand the kingdom and the polity, allow Assamese influence in his court and accept a non-Ahom title&mdash;''Swarganarayan''.<ref>{{harv|Gogoi|1968|p=283}}</ref>  [[Sukhaamphaa]] ''Khora Rojaa'' (1552\u20131603) began consulting Hindu astrologers alongside the traditional ''Deodhai-Bailung'' priests, and [[Pratap Singha]] (1603\u20131641) installed 13 Brahmin families as diplomats.<ref name=\"gogi2006p65\"/>  [[Assamese language]] coexisted with Tai language in the court till the reign of [[Pratap Singha]], during whose rule Assamese became dominant.  [[Sutamla]] (1648\u20131663) was the first Ahom king to be initiated into the [[Mahapuruxiya Dharma]],<ref>Sutamla accepted ''Ekasarana'' initiation in 1654. {{harv|Gogoi|1968|p=433}}</ref> and Ahom kings till Sulikphaa ''lora roja'' (1679\u20131681) continued to be disciples of one [[sattra]] or the other.<ref>{{harv|Gogoi|2006|p=66}}</ref> Mahapuruxiya pontiffs belonging to different sects began playing a greater role in state politics.  After the chaos of the late 17th century, [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Sinha]] (1681\u20131696), the first Tungkhungiya king began his rule with a deep distrust of these religious groups.  His son and successor [[Sukhrungphaa|Rudra Singha]] (1696\u20131714) searched for an alternative state religion, and his son and successor [[Sutanphaa|Siba Sinha]] (1714\u20131744) formally adopted [[Saktism]], the nemesis of the Mahapuruxiya sects.  The persecution of the Mahapuruxiya [[Sattra]]s under the Tunkhungiya rulers following Siba Singha was a crucial factor leading to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] that greatly depleted the Ahom kingdom.\n\n===King's Guards===\nThe king was guarded by a six thousand strong household troop under a ''Bhitarual Phukan''.  A unit of musketeers consisting of the king's relatives was established by Sukhamphaa Khora Raja that protected the capital (under the ''Bajua Hilaidari Konwar'') and the palace and environs (''Bhitarual Hilaidari Konwar'').<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=19}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:1000px height:auto barincrement:11px\nPlotArea   = left:0 bottom:50px top:0

39-Swargadeo dynastic history, there are three progenitor kings (all subsequent kings are descendants of these kings).  They are [[Sukaphaa]], who established the kingdom; [[Suhungmung]], who made the greatest territorial and political expansion of the kingdom; and [[Supaatphaa]], who established the House of [[Tungkhungia Ahom kings|Tungkhugia king]]s that reigned the kingdom during its political and cultural zenith, as well as the period of decay and end (except for [[Jogeswar Singha]], who was a descendant of Supaatphaa's father [[Gobar Roja|Gobar]], and who was installed as a puppet king by the Burmese).\n\nThe dynastic history and dates that are accepted today are the result of a re-examination of Ahom and other documents by a team of Nora astronomers and experts who were commissioned to do so by Gaurinath Singha (1780\u20131795).<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|1968|pp=534\u2013535}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The list of Swargadeos of the [[Ahom Kingdom]]\n|-\n!

They speak one of the [[Coast Salish languages]]. [[Nuxalk Nation|Nuxalk]] (Bella Coola) nation are usually included in the group, although [[Nuxalk language|their language]] is more closely related to [[Interior Salish languages]].\n\nThe Coast Salish are a large, loose grouping of many tribes with numerous distinct cultures and languages. Territory claimed by Coast Salish peoples span from the northern limit of the Salish Sea (aka [[Strait of Georgia]]) on the inside of [[Vancouver Island]] and covers most of southern Vancouver Island, all of the [[Lower Mainland]] and most of [[Puget Sound]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] (except for territories of now-extinct [[Chemakum]] people). Their traditional territories coincide with modern major metropolitan areas, namely [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Seattle]]. The Tillamook or [[Tillamook people|Nehalem]] around [[Tillamook, Oregon]] are the southernmost of the Coast Salish peoples.\n\nCoast Salish cultures differ considerably from those of their northern neighbours. They have a [[patrilineal]] rather than [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, with inheritance and descent passed through the male line. According to a 2013 estimate, the population of Coast Salish numbers at least 56,590 people, made of 28,406 [[Status Indians]] registered to Coast Salish bands in British Columbia, and 28,284 enrolled members of federally recognized Coast Salish tribes in Washington State.\n\n== The peoples ==\nBelow is a list of some, but not all, of the tribes and nations located in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2-of-2}}\n* [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]]\n* [[Chimakum]]\n* [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan]]\n**The Cowichan designation is derived from the name of one of several groups forming the [[Cowichan Tribes]] band government, the [[Quwutsun]].

In 1808, [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] of the [[North West Company]] entered Coast Salish territories via the [[Fraser Canyon]] and met various groups until reaching tidewater on the Fraser's North Arm, where he was attacked and repelled by [[Musqueam]] warriors. Throughout the 1810s, coastal fur trade extended further with infrequent shipping. \n\nThe establishment of Fort Vancouver in 1824 was important as it established a regular site of interaction with Clackamas, Multnomah, and Cascades Chinooks, as well as interior Klickitats, Cowlitz, Kalapuyas. Parties from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), led by [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]], travelled the length of the central and south Georgia Strait-Puget Sound. \n\nFrom the 1810s through 1850s, Coast Salish groups of Georgia Strait and Puget Sound experienced raiding by northern peoples, particularly the [[Laich-kwil-tach|Euclataws]] and [[Haida people|Haida]].\n\nIn 1827, HBC established [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]] east of present-day [[Vancouver|Vancouver, B.C]].  Whattlekainum, principal chief of the [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen people]], moved most of his people from [[Brownsville, British Columbia|Qiqayt (Brownsville)]] across the river from what was to become [[New Westminster]] to [[Kanaka Creek]], near the Fort, for security and to dominate trade with the Fort. European contact and trade began accelerating significantly, primarily with the [[Fraser River Salish]] (Sto:lo).\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]] and its farm were established in 1833 by the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]] a subsidiary of the [[Hudson's Bay Company|HBC]], between present-day [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] and [[Tacoma, Washington]].  Contact and trade began accelerating significantly with the southern Coast Salish.  Significant social change and change in social structures accelerates with increasing contact.  Initiative remained with Native traders until catastrophic population decline.  Native traders and Native economy were not particularly interested or dependent upon European trade or tools.  Trade goods were primarily luxuries such as trade blankets, ornamentation, guns and ammunition.  The HBC monopoly did not condone alcohol, but freebooter traders were under no compunction.<ref>(1) Suttles & Lane (1990) p. 489<br>(2) Although Hudson's Bay and Pendleton blankets have retained a widely renowned cachet to the present day.</ref>\n\nCatholic missionaries arrive in Puget Sound around 1839\u20131840; interest diminished by 1843, and Methodist missionaries were in the area from 1840 to 1842 but had no success.\n\nThe Stevens Treaties were negotiated in 1854\u201355, but many tribes had reservations and did not participate; others dropped out of treaty negotiations. (See, for example, [[Treaty of Point Elliott #Native Americans]] and [[Treaty of Point Elliott#Native Americans|# Non-signatory tribes]].) From 1850\u20131854, the [[Douglas Treaties]] were signed on Vancouver Island between various Coast Salish peoples around Victoria and Nanaimo, and also with two Kwakwaka'wakw groups on northern Vancouver Island. The Muckleshoot Reservation was established after the [[Puget Sound War]] of 1855&ndash;56.\n\nThrough the 1850s and 1860s, traditional resources became less and less available.  Sawmill work and employment selling natural resources began; Native men worked as loggers, in the mills, and as commercial fishers.  Women sold basketry and shellfish. Through the 1870s, agricultural work in hop yards of the east Sound river valley increased, including cultivation of mushrooms.<ref name=\"Suttles&Lane499-500\">Suttles & Lane (1990), pp. 499&#x2013;500</ref> The smallpox epidemic of 1862 killed many, and commercial fisheries employment began to decline significantly through the 1880s.\n\nAfter legislation amending the [[Indian Act]] was passed the previous year, in 1885 the [[potlatch]] was banned in Canada; it was banned in the US some years later.<ref>[http://www.schoolnet.ca/ABORIGINAL/umistweb/art6a-e.html Confiscation An Incident in History]</ref> This suppression ended in the US in 1934, and in 1951 in Canada. Some potlatching became overt immediately.<ref>Cole & Chaikin (1990)</ref> A resurgence of tribal culture began in the 1960s; national Civil Rights movements engendered civil action for treaty rights.\n\n[[Chief Dan George]]s delivered a pivotal speech in 1967 on what had happened to his people. This riveted audiences at a Canadian Centennial ceremony in Vancouver's [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]] and touched off public awareness and native activism in BC and Canada. By this point, through the 1960s and 1970s, employment in commercial fisheries had greatly declined; employment in logging and lumber mills also declined significantly with automation, outsourcing, and the decline in available resources through the 1980s.\n\nThe [[Boldt Decision]], passed in 1974 upheld by the Supreme Court in 1979 was, based on the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] of 1855 and restored fisheries rights to federally recognized Puget Sound tribes. \n\nSince the 1970s, many federally recognized tribes have developed some economic autonomy with (initially strongly contested) tax-free tobacco retail, development of casino gambling, fisheries and stewardship of fisheries.  Extant tribes not federally recognized continue ongoing legal proceedings and cultural development toward recognition.<ref>See also [[Treaty of Point Elliott#Context|Treaty of Point Elliott #Context]] and, for example, [[Duwamish (tribe)#Recent history|Duwamish (tribe) #Recent history]]</ref>  In British Columbia, 1970 marks the start of organized resistance to the \"white paper\" tabled by [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], then a cabinet ministry in the government of [[Pierre Trudeau]], which called for assimilation.

The smallpox  epidemic of 1862 started when an infected miner from San Francisco stopped in Victoria on his way to the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref>[http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/overview/index.html]</ref>  As the epidemic spread, police, supported by gunboats, forced thousands of First Nations people living in encampments around Victoria to leave and many returned to their home villages which spread the epidemic.

Warfare for the southern Coast Salish was primarily defensive, with occasional raiding into territory where there were no relatives.  No institutions existed for mobilizing or maintaining a standing force.\n\nThe common enemies of all the Coast Salish for most of the first half of the 19th century were the [[Laich-kwil-tach|Lekwiltok]] aka Southern Kwakiutl, commonly known in historical writings as the Euclataws or Yucultas. Regular raids by northern tribes, particularly an alliance between the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tongass people|Tongass]], and one group of [[Tsimshian]], are also notable.  With earlier access to European guns through the fur trade, they raided for slaves and loot.  Their victims organized retaliatory raids several times, attacking the Lekwiltok.<ref name=Suttles&Lane495-7>Suttles & Lane (1990), pp. 495&ndash;7</ref>\n\n==== Internal ====\nThe highest-ranking male assumed the role of ceremonial leader but rank could vary and was determined by different standards.<ref name=SalishArtCulture />  Villages were linked through intermarriage among members; the wife usually went to live at the husband's village.  Society was divided into upper class, lower class and slaves, all largely hereditary.<ref name=SalishArtCulture />  Nobility was based on genealogy, intertribal kinship, wise use of resources, and possession of esoteric knowledge about the workings of spirits and the world &mdash; making an effective marriage of class, secular, religious, and economic power.  Many Coast Salish mothers altered the appearance of their free-born by carefully shaping the heads of their babies, binding them with cradle boards just long enough to produce a steep sloping forehead.<ref>Miller (1996)</ref>\n\nUnlike hunter-gatherer societies widespread in North America, but similar to other Pacific Northwest coastal cultures, Coast Salish society was complex, hierarchical and oriented toward property and status.\n\nSlavery was widespread.<ref>Donald (1997)</ref> The Coast Salish held slaves as simple property and not as members of the tribe.  The children of slaves were born into slavery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haeberlin|first=Hermann|title=The Indians of Puget Sound|year=1942|publisher=University of Washington Press|page=57|url=http://scholarsarchive.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/12265/IndiansPugetSound.pdf?sequence=1|access-date=2013-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185834/http://scholarsarchive.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/12265/IndiansPugetSound.pdf?sequence=1|archive-date=2013-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe staple of their diet was typically [[salmon]], supplemented with a rich variety of other seafoods and forage.

A seated human feature bowl was used in a female puberty ritual in Secwepemc territory which helps women give birth.<ref>Rudy Reimer, Pierre Freile, Kenneth Fath, and John Clague, \"Tales From the River Bank: An In Situ Stone Bowl Found Along the shores of the Salish Sea on the Southern Northwest Coast of British Columbia,\" ''Journal of Northwest Anthropology'' 49 (2016): 2</ref> Salish made bowls in the Northwest have different artistic designs and features. There are many bowls that have basic designs with animal features on the surface. Similar bowls will have more decorations including a head, body, wings, and limbs. A seated figure bowl is more complex in design depicting humans being intertwined with animals.<ref>Rudy Reimer, Pierre Freile, Kenneth Fath, and John Clague, \"Tales From the River Bank: An In Situ Stone Bowl Found Along the shores of the Salish Sea on the Southern Northwest Coast of British Columbia,\" ''Journal of Northwest Anthropology'' 49 (2016): 3</ref>\n\nNorthwest coast Salish people valued material possessions above most things. Material wealth according to natives within the Northwest included things such as land, food resources, household items, and adornments. Material wealth not only improved one's life but it increased other qualities such as that was needed to acquire high status. Wealth was required to enhance their status as elite born, or through practical skills, and ritual knowledge.<ref>Gary Coupland, David Bilton, Terence Clark, Jerome S.

Wealth was not meant to be hidden and is publicly displayed through ceremony.\n\n==== Recreation ====\nGames often involved gambling on a sleight-of-hand game known as [[slahal]], as well as athletic contests.  Games that are similar to modern day [[lacrosse]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and forms of [[martial arts]] also existed.<ref>Pathways of the Past:  A look at the history and organization of the Squamishie people. Community archive of the S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh Pg. 4</ref>\n\n==== Beliefs ====\nBelief in guardian spirits and shapeshifting or transformation between human and animal spirits were widely shared in myriad forms. The relations of soul or souls, and conceptions of the lands of the living and the dead were complex and mutable. [[Vision quest]] journeys involving other states of consciousness were varied and widely practised. The Duwamish had a soul recovery and journey ceremony<ref name=Suttles&Lane495-7 /> and legends.\nThey also had many ceremonies and celebrations.\n\nThe Quileute Salish people near the Port Townsend area had their own beliefs about where souls of all living things go. The shamans of these people believed everything had five components to its spirit; the body, an inner and outer soul, its life force, and its ghost.<ref name=miller>Jay, Miller, Shamanic Odyssey (Menlo Park California: Ballena Press, 1988).</ref>{{rp|106}} It is believed that an individual becomes ill when their soul is removed from their body and is followed by death when it reaches the underworld. It is the job of the Shaman to travel to the underworld to save the individual by recovering the soul while it is travelling between the two worlds.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|106}}\n\nThe Shamans believed that once the individual's body is dead it is able to connect with its soul and shade in the underworld. It is believed that the spirits are able to come back amongst the living and cause family members to die of sickness and join them in the afterlife. Living individuals were terrified of the intentions of the spirits who only appear during the night, prompting Salish people to travel during the day and staying close to others for protection.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|106}} Coastal Salish beliefs describe the journey to the underworld as a two-day adventure. The individual must walk along a trail passing through bushes and a lake to reach a valley that is divided by a river where they will reside.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|107}} Salish belief of the afterlife very closely resembles the past life they lived often assigning themselves to jobs to keep busy, hunt for animals and game, and live with their families.\n\nCoastal Salish people believe that through dances, masks, or ceremonies they express themselves through the spiritual powers that they are given. Spirit powers define a community's success through leadership, warriordom, healing, or artistry. Spirit dancing ceremonies are common gatherings during the winter for members of the community to show their spirit powers through song, or dance.<ref name=angel>5. Bill, Angelbeck, \"localized Rituals and individual Spirit Powers: Discerning Regional Autonomy Through Religious Practices in the Coast Salish Past,\" ''Journal of Northwest Anthropology'' 50 (2016).</ref>{{rp|31}} The powers they acquired were sought after individually after going through trials of isolation where their powers relate to spirit animals such as a raven, woodpecker, bear, or seal. Oftentimes members of the community will get together to show their powers at the longhouse floor, where the spiritual powers are for the individual alone for each member to share and display various songs.<ref name=angel/>{{rp|31}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\nVillages of the Coast Salish typically consisted of [[Western Red Cedar]] split plank and [[earthen floor]] [[Native American long house|longhouses]] providing habitation for forty or more people, usually a related extended family.  Also used by many groups were [[pit-house]]s, known in the Chinook Jargon as ''kekuli'' (see [[Quiggly holes]]).  The villages were typically located near navigable water for easy transportation by dugout [[canoe]].  Houses that were part of the same village sometimes stretched for several miles along a river or watercourse.\n\nThe interior walls of longhouses were typically lined with sleeping platforms.  Storage shelves above the platforms held baskets, tools, clothing, and other items.  Firewood was stored below the platforms.  Mattresses and cushions were constructed from woven reed mats and animals skins. Food was hung to dry from the ceiling.  The larger houses included partitions to separate families, as well as interior fires with roof slats that functioned as chimneys.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe wealthy built extraordinarily large longhouses.  The Suquamish Oleman House ([[Old Man House]]) at what became the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation|Port Madison Reservation]] was 152 x 12&ndash;18 m (500 x 40&ndash;60&nbsp;ft), c. 1850.  The [[gambrel]] roof was unique to Puget Sound Coast Salish.<ref name=Suttles&Lane>Suttles & Lane (1990), p. 491</ref>\n\nThe Salish later took to constructing rock walls at strategic points near the [[Fraser Canyon|Fraser River Canyon]], along the Fraser River.  These Salish Defensive Sites are rock wall features constructed by Coast Salish peoples.<ref>Schaepe, D. (2006) Rock fortifications : Archaeological insights into precontact warfare and sociopolitical organization among the St\u00f3 :l\u014d of the Lower Fraser River Canyon, B.C.

(unpublished)</ref> The functions of these features may have included defense, fishing platforms, and creation of house terraces. House pits and stone tools have been found in association with certain sites. Methods used include use of a [[total station]] for mapping the sites as well as the creation of simple [[Shovel test pit|test pits]] to probe for [[stratigraphy]] and artifacts.\n\nNative groups along the Northwest coast have been using plants for making wood and fiber artifacts for over 10,500 years. Anthropologists are searching for aquifer wet sites that would contain ancient Salish villages. These sites are created by a series of waters running through the archaeological deposits creating an environment with no oxygen that preserves wood and fiber<ref>1. Dale R. Cross and Kathleen L. Hawes, \"Exploring Ancient Wood and Fiber Technologies along the Northwest coast of North America,\" ''Journal of Northwest Anthropology'' 47 (2013): 117.</ref> The wet sites would typically contain perishable artifacts that were used as wedges, fishhooks, basketry, cordage, and nets.\n\n=== Diet ===\nProvisionally, this is primarily southern Coast Salish, though much is in common with Coast Salish overall.\n\nAnthropogenic [[grassland]]s were maintained.  The south Coast Salish may have had more vegetables and land game than people farther north or among other peoples on the outer coast. Salmon and other fish were staples; see [[Coast Salish people and salmon]].  There was ''kakanee'', a freshwater fish in the Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish watersheds.  [[Shellfish]] were abundant.  Butter clams, [[horse clam]]s, and [[Lolium temulentum|cockles]] were dried for trade.\n\nHunting was specialized; professions were probably sea hunters, land hunters, fowlers.  Water fowl were captured on moonless nights using strategic flares.\n\nThe managed [[grassland]]s not only provided game habitat, but vegetable sprouts, roots, bulbs, berries, and nuts were foraged from them as well as found wild.  The most important were probably [[bracken]] and [[Camassia|camas]]; [[Sagittaria|wapato]] especially for the [[Duwamish (tribe)|Duwamish]].  Many, many varieties of berries were foraged; some were harvested with comblike devices not reportedly used elsewhere.  Acorns were relished but were not widely available.  Regional tribes went in autumn to the [[Nisqually River|Nisqually]] Flats (Nisqually plains) to harvest them.<ref name=\"Suttles&Lane488&ndash;9\" />\n\nSalish groups such as Muckleshoot were heavily reliant on seasonal foods that included animals and plants. In January, they would gather along the river banks to catch salmon. By May, Salmonberry sprouts would be eaten with salmon eggs. Men would hunt deer and elk, while women gathered camas and clams from the prairies and beaches. By the summer, steelhead and king salmon appeared in masses along the rivers, and berries were abundant in the forests.<ref>Heidi C.

They speak one of the [[Coast Salish languages]]. [[Nuxalk Nation|Nuxalk]] (Bella Coola) nation are usually included in the group, although [[Nuxalk language|their language]] is more closely related to [[Interior Salish languages]].\n\nThe Coast Salish are a large, loose grouping of many tribes with numerous distinct cultures and languages. Territory claimed by Coast Salish peoples span from the northern limit of the Salish Sea (aka [[Strait of Georgia]]) on the inside of [[Vancouver Island]] and covers most of southern Vancouver Island, all of the [[Lower Mainland]] and most of [[Puget Sound]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] (except for territories of now-extinct [[Chemakum]] people). Their traditional territories coincide with modern major metropolitan areas, namely [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Seattle]]. The Tillamook or [[Tillamook people|Nehalem]] around [[Tillamook, Oregon]] are the southernmost of the Coast Salish peoples.\n\nCoast Salish cultures differ considerably from those of their northern neighbours. They have a [[patrilineal]] rather than [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, with inheritance and descent passed through the male line. According to a 2013 estimate, the population of Coast Salish numbers at least 56,590 people, made of 28,406 [[Status Indians]] registered to Coast Salish bands in British Columbia, and 28,284 enrolled members of federally recognized Coast Salish tribes in Washington State.\n\n== The peoples ==\nBelow is a list of some, but not all, of the tribes and nations located in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2-of-2}}\n* [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]]\n* [[Chimakum]]\n* [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan]]\n**The Cowichan designation is derived from the name of one of several groups forming the [[Cowichan Tribes]] band government, the [[Quwutsun]].

In 1808, [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] of the [[North West Company]] entered Coast Salish territories via the [[Fraser Canyon]] and met various groups until reaching tidewater on the Fraser's North Arm, where he was attacked and repelled by [[Musqueam]] warriors. Throughout the 1810s, coastal fur trade extended further with infrequent shipping. \n\nThe establishment of Fort Vancouver in 1824 was important as it established a regular site of interaction with Clackamas, Multnomah, and Cascades Chinooks, as well as interior Klickitats, Cowlitz, Kalapuyas. Parties from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), led by [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]], travelled the length of the central and south Georgia Strait-Puget Sound. \n\nFrom the 1810s through 1850s, Coast Salish groups of Georgia Strait and Puget Sound experienced raiding by northern peoples, particularly the [[Laich-kwil-tach|Euclataws]] and [[Haida people|Haida]].\n\nIn 1827, HBC established [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]] east of present-day [[Vancouver|Vancouver, B.C]].  Whattlekainum, principal chief of the [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen people]], moved most of his people from [[Brownsville, British Columbia|Qiqayt (Brownsville)]] across the river from what was to become [[New Westminster]] to [[Kanaka Creek]], near the Fort, for security and to dominate trade with the Fort. European contact and trade began accelerating significantly, primarily with the [[Fraser River Salish]] (Sto:lo).\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]] and its farm were established in 1833 by the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]] a subsidiary of the [[Hudson's Bay Company|HBC]], between present-day [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] and [[Tacoma, Washington]].  Contact and trade began accelerating significantly with the southern Coast Salish.  Significant social change and change in social structures accelerates with increasing contact.  Initiative remained with Native traders until catastrophic population decline.  Native traders and Native economy were not particularly interested or dependent upon European trade or tools.  Trade goods were primarily luxuries such as trade blankets, ornamentation, guns and ammunition.  The HBC monopoly did not condone alcohol, but freebooter traders were under no compunction.<ref>(1) Suttles & Lane (1990) p. 489<br>(2) Although Hudson's Bay and Pendleton blankets have retained a widely renowned cachet to the present day.</ref>\n\nCatholic missionaries arrive in Puget Sound around 1839-1840; interest diminished by 1843, and Methodist missionaries were in the area from 1840 to 1842 but had no success.\n\nThe Stevens Treaties were negotiated in 1854-55, but many tribes had reservations and did not participate; others dropped out of treaty negotiations. (See, for example, [[Treaty of Point Elliott #Native Americans]] and [[Treaty of Point Elliott#Native Americans|# Non-signatory tribes]].) From 1850-1854, the [[Douglas Treaties]] were signed on Vancouver Island between various Coast Salish peoples around Victoria and Nanaimo, and also with two Kwakwaka'wakw groups on northern Vancouver Island. The Muckleshoot Reservation was established after the [[Puget Sound War]] of 1855&ndash;56.\n\nThrough the 1850s and 1860s, traditional resources became less and less available.  Sawmill work and employment selling natural resources began; Native men worked as loggers, in the mills, and as commercial fishers.  Women sold basketry and shellfish. Through the 1870s, agricultural work in hop yards of the east Sound river valley increased, including cultivation of mushrooms.<ref name=\"Suttles&Lane499-500\">Suttles & Lane (1990), pp. 499&#x2013;500</ref> The smallpox epidemic of 1862 killed many, and commercial fisheries employment began to decline significantly through the 1880s.\n\nAfter legislation amending the [[Indian Act]] was passed the previous year, in 1885 the [[potlatch]] was banned in Canada; it was banned in the US some years later.<ref>[http://www.schoolnet.ca/ABORIGINAL/umistweb/art6a-e.html Confiscation An Incident in History]</ref> This suppression ended in the US in 1934, and in 1951 in Canada. Some potlatching became overt immediately.<ref>Cole & Chaikin (1990)</ref> A resurgence of tribal culture began in the 1960s; national Civil Rights movements engendered civil action for treaty rights.\n\n[[Chief Dan George]]s delivered a pivotal speech in 1967 on what had happened to his people. This riveted audiences at a Canadian Centennial ceremony in Vancouver's [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]] and touched off public awareness and native activism in BC and Canada. By this point, through the 1960s and 1970s, employment in commercial fisheries had greatly declined; employment in logging and lumber mills also declined significantly with automation, outsourcing, and the decline in available resources through the 1980s.\n\nThe [[Boldt Decision]], passed in 1974 upheld by the Supreme Court in 1979 was, based on the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] of 1855 and restored fisheries rights to federally recognized Puget Sound tribes. \n\nSince the 1970s, many federally recognized tribes have developed some economic autonomy with (initially strongly contested) tax-free tobacco retail, development of casino gambling, fisheries and stewardship of fisheries.  Extant tribes not federally recognized continue ongoing legal proceedings and cultural development toward recognition.<ref>See also [[Treaty of Point Elliott#Context|Treaty of Point Elliott #Context]] and, for example, [[Duwamish (tribe)#Recent history|Duwamish (tribe) #Recent history]]</ref>  In British Columbia, 1970 marks the start of organized resistance to the \"white paper\" tabled by [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], then a cabinet ministry in the government of [[Pierre Trudeau]], which called for assimilation. In the wake of that, new terms such as [[Sto:lo]], [[Shishalh]] and [[Snuneymuxw]] began to replace older-era names conferred by anthropologists, linguists and governments.\n\n=== Population ===\nThe first smallpox epidemic to hit the region was in the 1680s, with the disease travelling overland from Mexico by intertribal transmission.<ref>[''The Resettlement of British Columbia'', Cole Harris, UBC]</ref> Among losses due to diseases, and a series of earlier epidemics that had wiped out many peoples entirely, e.g. the [[Snokomish]] in 1850, a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] broke out among the Northwest tribes in 1862, killing roughly half the affected native populations, in some cases up to 90% or more. The smallpox  epidemic of 1862 started when an infected miner from San Francisco stopped in Victoria on his way to the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref>[http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/overview/index.html]</ref>  As the epidemic spread, police, supported by gunboats, forced thousands of First Nations people living in encampments around Victoria to leave and many returned to their home villages which spread the epidemic.  Some consider the decision to force First Nations people to leave their encampments an intentional act of genocide.<ref>[http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/index.html]</ref>\nMean population decline 1774&ndash;1874 was about 66%.<ref>(1) Lange, Essay 5171)  <br>(2) Boyd (1999)  <br>(2.1)  A smallpox vaccine was discovered in 1801.

Warfare for the southern Coast Salish was primarily defensive, with occasional raiding into territory where there were no relatives.  No institutions existed for mobilizing or maintaining a standing force.\n\nThe common enemies of all the Coast Salish for most of the first half of the 19th century were the [[Laich-kwil-tach|Lekwiltok]] aka Southern Kwakiutl, commonly known in historical writings as the Euclataws or Yucultas. Regular raids by northern tribes, particularly an alliance between the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tongass people|Tongass]], and one group of [[Tsimshian]], are also notable.  With earlier access to European guns through the fur trade, they raided for slaves and loot.  Their victims organized retaliatory raids several times, attacking the Lekwiltok.<ref name=Suttles&Lane495-7>Suttles & Lane (1990), pp. 495&ndash;7</ref>\n\n==== Internal ====\nThe highest-ranking male assumed the role of ceremonial leader but rank could vary and was determined by different standards.<ref name=SalishArtCulture />  Villages were linked through intermarriage among members; the wife usually went to live at the husband's village.  Society was divided into upper class, lower class and slaves, all largely hereditary.<ref name=SalishArtCulture />  Nobility was based on genealogy, intertribal kinship, wise use of resources, and possession of esoteric knowledge about the workings of spirits and the world &mdash; making an effective marriage of class, secular, religious, and economic power.

Material wealth according to natives within the Northwest included things such as land, food resources, household items, and adornments. Material wealth not only improved one's life but it increased other qualities such as that was needed to acquire high status. Wealth was required to enhance their status as elite born, or through practical skills, and ritual knowledge.<ref>Gary Coupland, David Bilton, Terence Clark, Jerome S.

Wealth was not meant to be hidden and is publicly displayed through ceremony.\n\n==== Recreation ====\nGames often involved gambling on a sleight-of-hand game known as [[slahal]], as well as athletic contests.  Games that are similar to modern day [[lacrosse]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and forms of [[martial arts]] also existed.<ref>Pathways of the Past:  A look at the history and organization of the Squamishie people. Community archive of the S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh Pg. 4</ref>\n\n==== Beliefs ====\nBelief in guardian spirits and shapeshifting or transformation between human and animal spirits were widely shared in myriad forms. The relations of soul or souls, and conceptions of the lands of the living and the dead were complex and mutable. [[Vision quest]] journeys involving other states of consciousness were varied and widely practised. The Duwamish had a soul recovery and journey ceremony<ref name=Suttles&Lane495-7 /> and legends.\nThey also had many ceremonies and celebrations.\n\nThe Quileute Salish people near the Port Townsend area had their own beliefs about where souls of all living things go. The shamans of these people believed everything had five components to its spirit; the body, an inner and outer soul, its life force, and its ghost.<ref name=miller>Jay, Miller, Shamanic Odyssey (Menlo Park California: Ballena Press, 1988).</ref>{{rp|106}} It is believed that an individual becomes ill when their soul is removed from their body and is followed by death when it reaches the underworld. It is the job of the Shaman to travel to the underworld to save the individual by recovering the soul while it is travelling between the two worlds.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|106}}\n\nThe Shamans believed that once the individual's body is dead it is able to connect with its soul and shade in the underworld. It is believed that the spirits are able to come back amongst the living and cause family members to die of sickness and join them in the afterlife. Living individuals were terrified of the intentions of the spirits who only appear during the night, prompting Salish people to travel during the day and staying close to others for protection.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|106}} Coastal Salish beliefs describe the journey to the underworld as a two-day adventure. The individual must walk along a trail passing through bushes and a lake to reach a valley that is divided by a river where they will reside.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|107}} Salish belief of the afterlife very closely resembles the past life they lived often assigning themselves to jobs to keep busy, hunt for animals and game, and live with their families.\n\nCoastal Salish people believe that through dances, masks, or ceremonies they express themselves through the spiritual powers that they are given. Spirit powers define a community's success through leadership, warriordom, healing, or artistry. Spirit dancing ceremonies are common gatherings during the winter for members of the community to show their spirit powers through song, or dance.<ref name=angel>5. Bill, Angelbeck, \"localized Rituals and individual Spirit Powers: Discerning Regional Autonomy Through Religious Practices in the Coast Salish Past,\" ''Journal of Northwest Anthropology'' 50 (2016).</ref>{{rp|31}} The powers they acquired were sought after individually after going through trials of isolation where their powers relate to spirit animals such as a raven, woodpecker, bear, or seal. Oftentimes members of the community will get together to show their powers at the longhouse floor, where the spiritual powers are for the individual alone for each member to share and display various songs.<ref name=angel/>{{rp|31}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\nVillages of the Coast Salish typically consisted of [[Western Red Cedar]] split plank and [[earthen floor]] [[Native American long house|longhouses]] providing habitation for forty or more people, usually a related extended family.  Also used by many groups were [[pit-house]]s, known in the Chinook Jargon as ''kekuli'' (see [[Quiggly holes]]).  The villages were typically located near navigable water for easy transportation by dugout [[canoe]].  Houses that were part of the same village sometimes stretched for several miles along a river or watercourse.\n\nThe interior walls of longhouses were typically lined with sleeping platforms.  Storage shelves above the platforms held baskets, tools, clothing, and other items.  Firewood was stored below the platforms.  Mattresses and cushions were constructed from woven reed mats and animals skins. Food was hung to dry from the ceiling.  The larger houses included partitions to separate families, as well as interior fires with roof slats that functioned as chimneys.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe wealthy built extraordinarily large longhouses.  The Suquamish Oleman House ([[Old Man House]]) at what became the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation|Port Madison Reservation]] was 152 x 12&ndash;18 m (500 x 40&ndash;60&nbsp;ft), c. 1850.  The [[gambrel]] roof was unique to Puget Sound Coast Salish.<ref name=Suttles&Lane>Suttles & Lane (1990), p. 491</ref>\n\nThe Salish later took to constructing rock walls at strategic points near the [[Fraser Canyon|Fraser River Canyon]], along the Fraser River.  These Salish Defensive Sites are rock wall features constructed by Coast Salish peoples.<ref>Schaepe, D.

House pits and stone tools have been found in association with certain sites. Methods used include use of a [[total station]] for mapping the sites as well as the creation of simple [[Shovel test pit|test pits]] to probe for [[stratigraphy]] and artifacts.\n\nNative groups along the Northwest coast have been using plants for making wood and fiber artifacts for over 10,500 years. Anthropologists are searching for aquifer wet sites that would contain ancient Salish villages. These sites are created by a series of waters running through the archaeological deposits creating an environment with no oxygen that preserves wood and fiber<ref>1. Dale R. Cross and Kathleen L. Hawes, \"Exploring Ancient Wood and Fiber Technologies along the Northwest coast of North America,\" ''Journal of Northwest Anthropology'' 47 (2013): 117.</ref> The wet sites would typically contain perishable artifacts that were used as wedges, fishhooks, basketry, cordage, and nets.\n\n=== Diet ===\nProvisionally, this is primarily southern Coast Salish, though much is in common with Coast Salish overall.\n\nAnthropogenic [[grassland]]s were maintained.  The south Coast Salish may have had more vegetables and land game than people farther north or among other peoples on the outer coast. Salmon and other fish were staples; see [[Coast Salish people and salmon]].  There was ''kakanee'', a freshwater fish in the Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish watersheds.  [[Shellfish]] were abundant.  Butter clams, [[horse clam]]s, and [[Lolium temulentum|cockles]] were dried for trade.\n\nHunting was specialized; professions were probably sea hunters, land hunters, fowlers.  Water fowl were captured on moonless nights using strategic flares.\n\nThe managed [[grassland]]s not only provided game habitat, but vegetable sprouts, roots, bulbs, berries, and nuts were foraged from them as well as found wild.  The most important were probably [[bracken]] and [[Camassia|camas]]; [[Sagittaria|wapato]] especially for the [[Duwamish (tribe)|Duwamish]].  Many, many varieties of berries were foraged; some were harvested with comblike devices not reportedly used elsewhere.  Acorns were relished but were not widely available.  Regional tribes went in autumn to the [[Nisqually River|Nisqually]] Flats (Nisqually plains) to harvest them.<ref name=\"Suttles&Lane488&ndash;9\" />\n\nSalish groups such as Muckleshoot were heavily reliant on seasonal foods that included animals and plants. In January, they would gather along the river banks to catch salmon. By May, Salmonberry sprouts would be eaten with salmon eggs. Men would hunt deer and elk, while women gathered camas and clams from the prairies and beaches. By the summer, steelhead and king salmon appeared in masses along the rivers, and berries were abundant in the forests.<ref>Heidi C.

{"title_page": "Photoemission electron microscopy", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2012}}\n'''Photoemission electron microscopy''' ('''PEEM''', also called '''photoelectron microscopy''', '''PEM''') is a type of [[electron microscopy]] that utilizes local variations in [[electron]] emission to generate image contrast.{{cn|date=February 2019}} The excitation is usually produced by [[ultraviolet light]], [[synchrotron radiation]] or [[X-ray]] sources. PEEM measures the coefficient indirectly by collecting the emitted [[secondary electron]]s generated in the electron cascade that follows the creation of the primary core hole in the absorption process. PEEM is a surface sensitive technique because the emitted electrons originate from a shallow layer. In physics, this technique is referred to as PEEM, which goes together naturally with [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED), and [[low-energy electron microscopy]] ([[LEEM]]). In biology, it is called photoelectron microscopy (PEM), which fits with [[photoelectron spectroscopy]] (PES), [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buseck|first1=Peter|last2=Cowley|first2=John|last3=Eyring|first3=Leroy|title=High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and Associated Techniques|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> and [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:PEEM figure3.jpg|thumb|Early photoelectron emission microscope of E. Br\u00fcche at AEG, Berlin, reproduced from his 1933 paper]]\n\n===Initial development===\n\nIn 1933, [[Ernst Br\u00fcche]] reported images of cathodes illuminated by UV light. This work was extended by two of his colleagues, H. Mahl and J. Pohl. Br\u00fcche made a sketch of his photoelectron emission microscope in his 1933 paper (Figure 1). This is evidently the first photoelectron emission microscope (PEEM).\n\n===Improved techniques===\nIn 1963, G. F. Rempfer designed the electron optics for an early ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) PEEM. In 1965, G. Burroughs at the Night Vision Laboratory, Fort Belvoir, Virginia built the bakeable electrostatic lenses and metal-sealed valves for PEEM. During the 1960s, in the PEEM, as well as [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]], the specimens were grounded and could be transferred in the UHV environment to several positions for photocathode formation, processing and observation. These electron microscopes were used for only a brief period of time, but the components live on. The first commercially available PEEM was designed and tested by Engel during the 1960s for his thesis work under [[Ernst Ruska|E. Ruska]] and developed it into a marketable product, called the \"Metioskop KE3\", by Balzers in 1971. The electron lenses and voltage divider of the PEEM were incorporated into one version of a PEEM for biological studies in Eugene, Oregon around 1970.\n\n===Further research===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the second generation (PEEM-2) and third generation (PEEM-3) microscopes were constructed. PEEM-2 is a conventional not aberration-corrected instrument employing electrostatic lenses. It uses a cooled [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fiber-coupled to a phosphor to detect the electron-optical image. The aberration corrected microscope PEEM-3 employs a curved electron mirror to counter the lowest order aberrations of the electron lenses and the accelerating field.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Photoelectric effect===\n{{main|Photoelectric effect}}\n\nThe photoemission or [[photoelectric effect]] is a quantum electronic phenomenon in which electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from matter after the absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation such as UV light or X-ray.\n\nWhen UV light or X-ray is absorbed by matter, electrons are excited from core levels into unoccupied states, leaving empty core states. Secondary electrons are generated by the decay of the core hole. Auger processes and inelastic electron scattering create a cascade of low-energy electrons. Some electrons penetrate the sample surface and escape into vacuum. A wide spectrum of electrons is emitted with energies between the energy of the illumination and the [[work function]] of the sample. This wide electron distribution is the principal source of image aberration in the microscope.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n[[Image:PEEM figure4.jpg|thumb|right|Photoelectric effect]]\n[[Image:PEEM figure5.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic illustration of the photoemission process]]\nUsing Einstein's method, the following equations are used:\nEnergy of photon=Energy needed to remove an electron + Kinetic energy of the emitted electron\n\n:<math>hf=\\phi + E_{k_{max}} \\,</math>\n\n''h'' is Planck's constant;\n\n''f'' is the frequency of the incident photon;\n\n:<math>\\phi=h f_0 \\ </math> is the [[work function]];\n\n:<math>E_{k_{max}}=\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 </math> is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons;\n\n''f''<sub>0</sub> is the threshold frequency for the photoelectric effect to occur;\n\n''m'' is the rest mass of the ejected electron;\n\n''v''<sub>m</sub> is the speed of the ejected electron.\n\n===Electron emission microscopy===\nElectron emission microscopy is a type of electron microscopy in which the information carrying beam of electrons originates from the specimen. The source of energy causing the electron emission can be heat (thermionic emission), light (photoelectron emission), ions, or neutral particles, but normally excludes field emission and other methods involving a point source or tip microscopy.\n\n===Photoelectron imaging===\nPhotoelectron imaging includes any form of imaging in which the source of information is the distribution of points from which electrons are ejected from the specimen by the action of photons. The technique with the highest resolution photoelectron imaging is presently photoelectron emission microscopy using UV light.\n\n==Photoemission electron microscope==\nA photoemission electron microscope is a parallel imaging instrument. It creates at any given moment a complete picture of the photoelectron distribution emitted from the imaged surface region.\n\n===Light sources===\nThe viewed area of the specimen must be illuminated homogeneously with appropriate radiation (ranging from UV to hard x-rays). [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] is the most common radiation used in PEEM because very bright sources are available, like [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] lamps. However, other wavelengths (like soft x-rays) are preferred where analytical information is required.\n\n===Electron optical column and resolution===\n[[Image:PEEM figure6.jpg|thumb|right|Scheme of the photoemission electron microscope]]\nThe electron optical column contains two or more electrostatic or magnetic electron lenses, corrector elements such as a [[stigmator]] and deflector, an angle-limiting aperture in the backfocal{{not a typo}} plane of one of the lenses.\n\nAs in any emission electron microscope, the objective or cathode lens determines the resolution. The latter is dependent on the electron-optical qualities, such as spherical aberrations, and the energy spread of the photoemitted electrons. The electrons are emitted into the vacuum with an angular distribution close to a cosine square function. A significant velocity component parallel to the surface will decrease the lateral resolution. The faster electrons, leaving the surface exactly along the center line of the PEEM, will also negatively influence the resolution due to the chromatic aberration of the cathode lens. The resolution is inversely proportional to the accelerating field strength at the surface but proportional to the energy spread of the electrons. So resolution r is approximately:\n\n:<math>r\\approx \\frac{d\\,\\Delta\\,E}{e\\,U}</math>\n[[Image:PEEM figure7.jpg|thumb|right|Typical photoemission electron microscope]]\nIn the equation, d is the distance between the specimen and the objective, \u0394E is the distribution width of the initial electron energies and U is the accelerating voltage.\n\nBesides the cathode or objective lens, situated on the left hand side of Figure 4, two more lenses are utilized to create an image of the specimen: an intermediate three-electrode lens is used to vary the total magnification between 100\u00d7 if the lens is deactivated, and up to 1000\u00d7 when needed. On the right-hand side of Figure 4 is the projector, a three electrode lens combined with a two-element deceleration lens. The main task of this lens combination is the deceleration of the fast 20 keV electrons to energies for which the channelplate{{not a typo}} has its highest sensitivity. Such an image intensifier has its best performance for impinging electrons with kinetic energies roughly about 1 keV.\n\n===Energy filter===\nAn energy filter can be added to the instrument in order to select the electrons that will contribute to the image. This option is particularly used for analytical applications of the PEEM. By using an energy filter, a PEEM microscope can be seen as imaging [[Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) or [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS). By using this method, spatially resolved photoemission spectra can be acquired with spatial resolutions on the 100&nbsp;nm scale and with sub-eV resolution. Using such instrument, one can acquire elemental images with chemical state sensibility or work function maps. Also, since the photoelectron are emitted only at the very surface of the material, surface termination maps can be acquired.\n\n===Detector===\nA detector is placed at the end of electron optical column. Usually, a phosphor screen is used to convert the electron image to a photon image. The choice of phosphor type is governed by resolution considerations. A multichannel plate detector that is imaged by a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera can substitute phosphor screen.\n\n==Time-resolved PEEM==\nCompared to many other electron microscopy techniques, time-resolved PEEM offers a very high temporal resolution of only a few femtoseconds with prospects of advancing it to the attosecond regime. The reason is that temporal electron pulse broadening does not deteriorate the temporal resolution because electrons are only used to achieve a high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution is reached by using very short light pulses in a pump-probe setup. A first pulse optically excites dynamics like surface plasmons on a sample surface and a second pulse probes the dynamics after a certain waiting time by photoemitting electrons. The photoemission rate is influenced by the local excitation level of the sample. Hence, spatial information about the dynamics on the sample can be gained. By repeating this experiment with a series of waiting times between pump and probe pulse, a movie of the dynamics on a sample can be recorded.\n\nLaser pulses in the visible spectral range are typically used in combination with a PEEM. They offer a temporal resolution of a few to 100 fs. In recent years, pulses with shorter wavelengths have been used to achieve a more direct access to the instantaneous electron excitation in the material. Here, a first pulse in the visible excites dynamics near the sample surface and a second pulse with a photon energy significantly above the work function of the material emits the electrons. By employing additional time-of-flight or high-pass energy recording in the PEEM, information about the instantaneous electronic distribution in a nanostructure can be extracted with high spatial and temporal resolution.\n\nEfforts to achieve attosecond temporal resolution and with that directly record optical fields around nanostructures with so far unreached spatio-temporal resolution, are still ongoing.\n\n\n==Limitations==\nThe general limitation of PEEM, which is common with most surface science methods, is that the PEEM operates only under fairly restricted vacuum conditions. Whenever electrons are used to excite a specimen or carry information from its surface there has to be a vacuum with an appropriate mean free path for the electrons. With ''In-situ'' PEEM techniques, water and aqueous solution can be observed by PEEM.\n\nThe resolution of PEEM is limited to about 10&nbsp;nm, which results from a spread of the photoelectron emission angle. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ([[ARPES]]) is a powerful tool for structure analysis. However, it may be difficult to make angle-resolved and energy-selective PEEM measurements because of a lack of intensity. The availability of synchrotron-radiation light sources can offer exciting possibilities in this regard.\n\n==Comparison from other techniques==\nTransmission electron microscopy ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) and scanning electron microscopy ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]): PEEM differs from these two microscopies by using an electric accelerating field at the surface of specimen. The specimen is part of the electron-optical system.\n\nLow-energy electron microscopy ([[LEEM]]) and mirror electron microscopy (MEM): these two electron emission microscopy use electron gun supply beams which are directed toward the specimen, decelerated and backscattered from the specimen or reflected just before reaching the specimen. In photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) the same specimen geometry and immersion lens are used, but the electron guns are omitted.\n\n==New PEEM technologies==\nTime resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM) is well suited for real-time observation of fast processes on surfaces equipped with pulsed synchrotron radiation for illumination.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=O.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=Wiemann|first3=C.|last4=Porath|first4=R.|last5=Scharte|first5=M.|last6=Andreyev|first6=O.|last7=Sch\u00f6nhense|first7=G.|last8=Aeschlimann|first8=M.|title=Time-resolved two photon photoemission electron microscopy|journal=Applied Physics B|date=11 February 2014|volume=74|issue=3|pages=223\u2013227|doi=10.1007/s003400200803}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krasyuk|first1=A.|last2=Oelsner|first2=A.|last3=Nepijko|first3=S.A.|last4=Kuksov|first4=A.|last5=Schneider|first5=C.M.|last6=Sch\u00f6nhense|first6=G.|title=Time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy of magnetic field and magnetisation changes|journal=Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing|date=1 April 2003|volume=76|issue=6|pages=863\u2013868|doi=10.1007/s00339-002-1965-8|bibcode=2003ApPhA..76..863K}}</ref>\n*Time-of-flight Photoemission electron microscopy ([[Time-of-flight|TOF]]-PEEM): TOF-PEEM is PEEM using an ultrafast gated CCD camera or a time-and space-resolving counting detector for observing fast processes on surfaces.\n*Multiphoton Photoemission electron microscopy: Multiphoton PEEM can be employed for the study of localized surface plasmon excitations in nanoclusters or for direct spatial observation of the hot-electron lifetime in structured films using femtosecond lasers.\n*PEEM in liquids and dense gases: The development of microfabricated thin liquid cells in late 90-s enabled wide field-of-view transmission X-ray microscopy of liquid and gaseous samples confined between two SiN membranes.

PEEM measures the coefficient indirectly by collecting the emitted [[secondary electron]]s generated in the electron cascade that follows the creation of the primary core hole in the absorption process. PEEM is a surface sensitive technique because the emitted electrons originate from a shallow layer. In physics, this technique is referred to as PEEM, which goes together naturally with [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED), and [[low-energy electron microscopy]] ([[LEEM]]). In biology, it is called photoelectron microscopy (PEM), which fits with [[photoelectron spectroscopy]] (PES), [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buseck|first1=Peter|last2=Cowley|first2=John|last3=Eyring|first3=Leroy|title=High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and Associated Techniques|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> and [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:PEEM figure3.jpg|thumb|Early photoelectron emission microscope of E. Br\u00fcche at AEG, Berlin, reproduced from his 1933 paper]]\n\n===Initial development===\n\nIn 1933, [[Ernst Br\u00fcche]] reported images of cathodes illuminated by UV light. This work was extended by two of his colleagues, H. Mahl and J. Pohl. Br\u00fcche made a sketch of his photoelectron emission microscope in his 1933 paper (Figure 1). This is evidently the first photoelectron emission microscope (PEEM).\n\n===Improved techniques===\nIn 1963, G. F. Rempfer designed the electron optics for an early ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) PEEM. In 1965, G. Burroughs at the Night Vision Laboratory, Fort Belvoir, Virginia built the bakeable electrostatic lenses and metal-sealed valves for PEEM. During the 1960s, in the PEEM, as well as [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]], the specimens were grounded and could be transferred in the UHV environment to several positions for photocathode formation, processing and observation. These electron microscopes were used for only a brief period of time, but the components live on. The first commercially available PEEM was designed and tested by Engel during the 1960s for his thesis work under [[Ernst Ruska|E. Ruska]] and developed it into a marketable product, called the \"Metioskop KE3\", by Balzers in 1971. The electron lenses and voltage divider of the PEEM were incorporated into one version of a PEEM for biological studies in Eugene, Oregon around 1970.\n\n===Further research===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the second generation (PEEM-2) and third generation (PEEM-3) microscopes were constructed. PEEM-2 is a conventional not aberration-corrected instrument employing electrostatic lenses. It uses a cooled [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fiber-coupled to a phosphor to detect the electron-optical image. The aberration corrected microscope PEEM-3 employs a curved electron mirror to counter the lowest order aberrations of the electron lenses and the accelerating field.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Photoelectric effect===\n{{main|Photoelectric effect}}\n\nThe photoemission or [[photoelectric effect]] is a quantum electronic phenomenon in which electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from matter after the absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation such as UV light or X-ray.\n\nWhen UV light or X-ray is absorbed by matter, electrons are excited from core levels into unoccupied states, leaving empty core states. Secondary electrons are generated by the decay of the core hole. Auger processes and inelastic electron scattering create a cascade of low-energy electrons. Some electrons penetrate the sample surface and escape into vacuum. A wide spectrum of electrons is emitted with energies between the energy of the illumination and the [[work function]] of the sample. This wide electron distribution is the principal source of image aberration in the microscope.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n[[Image:PEEM figure4.jpg|thumb|right|Photoelectric effect]]\n[[Image:PEEM figure5.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic illustration of the photoemission process]]\nUsing Einstein\u2019s method, the following equations are used:\nEnergy of photon=Energy needed to remove an electron + Kinetic energy of the emitted electron\n\n:<math>hf=\\phi + E_{k_{max}} \\,</math>\n\n''h'' is Planck\u2019s constant;\n\n''f'' is the frequency of the incident photon;\n\n:<math>\\phi=h f_0 \\ </math> is the [[work function]];\n\n:<math>E_{k_{max}}=\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 </math> is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons;\n\n''f''<sub>0</sub> is the threshold frequency for the photoelectric effect to occur;\n\n''m'' is the rest mass of the ejected electron;\n\n''v''<sub>m</sub> is the speed of the ejected electron.\n\n===Electron emission microscopy===\nElectron emission microscopy is a type of electron microscopy in which the information carrying beam of electrons originates from the specimen. The source of energy causing the electron emission can be heat (thermionic emission), light (photoelectron emission), ions, or neutral particles, but normally excludes field emission and other methods involving a point source or tip microscopy.\n\n===Photoelectron imaging===\nPhotoelectron imaging includes any form of imaging in which the source of information is the distribution of points from which electrons are ejected from the specimen by the action of photons. The technique with the highest resolution photoelectron imaging is presently photoelectron emission microscopy using UV light.\n\n==Photoemission electron microscope==\nA photoemission electron microscope is a parallel imaging instrument. It creates at any given moment a complete picture of the photoelectron distribution emitted from the imaged surface region.\n\n===Light sources===\nThe viewed area of the specimen must be illuminated homogeneously with appropriate radiation (ranging from UV to hard x-rays). [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] is the most common radiation used in PEEM because very bright sources are available, like [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] lamps. However, other wavelengths (like soft x-rays) are preferred where analytical information is required.\n\n===Electron optical column and resolution===\n[[Image:PEEM figure6.jpg|thumb|right|Scheme of the photoemission electron microscope]]\nThe electron optical column contains two or more electrostatic or magnetic electron lenses, corrector elements such as a [[stigmator]] and deflector, an angle-limiting aperture in the backfocal{{not a typo}} plane of one of the lenses.\n\nAs in any emission electron microscope, the objective or cathode lens determines the resolution. The latter is dependent on the electron-optical qualities, such as spherical aberrations, and the energy spread of the photoemitted electrons. The electrons are emitted into the vacuum with an angular distribution close to a cosine square function. A significant velocity component parallel to the surface will decrease the lateral resolution. The faster electrons, leaving the surface exactly along the center line of the PEEM, will also negatively influence the resolution due to the chromatic aberration of the cathode lens. The resolution is inversely proportional to the accelerating field strength at the surface but proportional to the energy spread of the electrons. So resolution r is approximately:\n\n:<math>r\\approx \\frac{d\\,\\Delta\\,E}{e\\,U}</math>\n[[Image:PEEM figure7.jpg|thumb|right|Typical photoemission electron microscope]]\nIn the equation, d is the distance between the specimen and the objective, \u0394E is the distribution width of the initial electron energies and U is the accelerating voltage.\n\nBesides the cathode or objective lens, situated on the left hand side of Figure 4, two more lenses are utilized to create an image of the specimen: an intermediate three-electrode lens is used to vary the total magnification between 100\u00d7 if the lens is deactivated, and up to 1000\u00d7 when needed. On the right-hand side of Figure 4 is the projector, a three electrode lens combined with a two-element deceleration lens. The main task of this lens combination is the deceleration of the fast 20 keV electrons to energies for which the channelplate{{not a typo}} has its highest sensitivity. Such an image intensifier has its best performance for impinging electrons with kinetic energies roughly about 1 keV.\n\n===Energy filter===\nAn energy filter can be added to the instrument in order to select the electrons that will contribute to the image. This option is particularly used for analytical applications of the PEEM. By using an energy filter, a PEEM microscope can be seen as imaging [[Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) or [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS). By using this method, spatially resolved photoemission spectra can be acquired with spatial resolutions on the 100&nbsp;nm scale and with sub-eV resolution. Using such instrument, one can acquire elemental images with chemical state sensibility or work function maps. Also, since the photoelectron are emitted only at the very surface of the material, surface termination maps can be acquired.\n\n===Detector===\nA detector is placed at the end of electron optical column. Usually, a phosphor screen is used to convert the electron image to a photon image. The choice of phosphor type is governed by resolution considerations. A multichannel plate detector that is imaged by a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera can substitute phosphor screen.\n\n==Time-resolved PEEM==\nCompared to many other electron microscopy techniques, time-resolved PEEM offers a very high temporal resolution of only a few femtoseconds with prospects of advancing it to the attosecond regime. The reason is that temporal electron pulse broadening does not deteriorate the temporal resolution because electrons are only used to achieve a high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution is reached by using very short light pulses in a pump-probe setup. A first pulse optically excites dynamics like surface plasmons on a sample surface and a second pulse probes the dynamics after a certain waiting time by photoemitting electrons. The photoemission rate is influenced by the local excitation level of the sample. Hence, spatial information about the dynamics on the sample can be gained. By repeating this experiment with a series of waiting times between pump and probe pulse, a movie of the dynamics on a sample can be recorded.\n\nLaser pulses in the visible spectral range are typically used in combination with a PEEM. They offer a temporal resolution of a few to 100 fs. In recent years, pulses with shorter wavelengths have been used to achieve a more direct access to the instantaneous electron excitation in the material. Here, a first pulse in the visible excites dynamics near the sample surface and a second pulse with a photon energy significantly above the work function of the material emits the electrons. By employing additional time-of-flight or high-pass energy recording in the PEEM, information about the instantaneous electronic distribution in a nanostructure can be extracted with high spatial and temporal resolution.\n\nEfforts to achieve attosecond temporal resolution and with that directly record optical fields around nanostructures with so far unreached spatio-temporal resolution, are still ongoing.\n\n\n==Limitations==\nThe general limitation of PEEM, which is common with most surface science methods, is that the PEEM operates only under fairly restricted vacuum conditions. Whenever electrons are used to excite a specimen or carry information from its surface there has to be a vacuum with an appropriate mean free path for the electrons. With ''In-situ'' PEEM techniques, water and aqueous solution can be observed by PEEM.\n\nThe resolution of PEEM is limited to about 10&nbsp;nm, which results from a spread of the photoelectron emission angle. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ([[ARPES]]) is a powerful tool for structure analysis. However, it may be difficult to make angle-resolved and energy-selective PEEM measurements because of a lack of intensity. The availability of synchrotron-radiation light sources can offer exciting possibilities in this regard.\n\n==Comparison from other techniques==\nTransmission electron microscopy ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) and scanning electron microscopy ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]): PEEM differs from these two microscopies by using an electric accelerating field at the surface of specimen. The specimen is part of the electron-optical system.\n\nLow-energy electron microscopy ([[LEEM]]) and mirror electron microscopy (MEM): these two electron emission microscopy use electron gun supply beams which are directed toward the specimen, decelerated and backscattered from the specimen or reflected just before reaching the specimen. In photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) the same specimen geometry and immersion lens are used, but the electron guns are omitted.\n\n==New PEEM technologies==\nTime resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM) is well suited for real-time observation of fast processes on surfaces equipped with pulsed synchrotron radiation for illumination.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=O.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=Wiemann|first3=C.|last4=Porath|first4=R.|last5=Scharte|first5=M.|last6=Andreyev|first6=O.|last7=Sch\u00f6nhense|first7=G.|last8=Aeschlimann|first8=M.|title=Time-resolved two photon photoemission electron microscopy|journal=Applied Physics B|date=11 February 2014|volume=74|issue=3|pages=223\u2013227|doi=10.1007/s003400200803}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krasyuk|first1=A.|last2=Oelsner|first2=A.|last3=Nepijko|first3=S.A.|last4=Kuksov|first4=A.|last5=Schneider|first5=C.M.|last6=Sch\u00f6nhense|first6=G.|title=Time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy of magnetic field and magnetisation changes|journal=Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing|date=1 April 2003|volume=76|issue=6|pages=863\u2013868|doi=10.1007/s00339-002-1965-8|bibcode=2003ApPhA..76..863K}}</ref>\n*Time-of-flight Photoemission electron microscopy ([[Time-of-flight|TOF]]-PEEM): TOF-PEEM is PEEM using an ultrafast gated CCD camera or a time-and space-resolving counting detector for observing fast processes on surfaces.\n*Multiphoton Photoemission electron microscopy: Multiphoton PEEM can be employed for the study of localized surface plasmon excitations in nanoclusters or for direct spatial observation of the hot-electron lifetime in structured films using femtosecond lasers.\n*PEEM in liquids and dense gases: The development of microfabricated thin liquid cells in late 90-s enabled wide field-of-view transmission X-ray microscopy of liquid and gaseous samples confined between two SiN membranes.

have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters are demanding an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings, and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>.

As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

Teplyakov was born in [[Tambov]], [[Russia]]. At the age of 17, in January 1943, he was drafted into the [[Red Army]] to fight in the [[World War II|Second World War]], serving in the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]. He participated in a number of operations in [[Right-bank Ukraine]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Eastern Europe]] and was awarded combat orders and medals.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jan Cherniak |author2=Jane Zavalishina |author3=Elena Kolmanovskaya |author4=Ekaterina Solntseva |title=List of Veterans in the Moscow Area| year = 2005 | url = http://www.pobediteli.ru/russia/center/moskovskaya/t/tek-tib/index.html| accessdate = 2009-12-14}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, he graduated from the All-Union Correspondence Polytechnic Institute in [[Moscow]] and joined the team of scientists at the [[Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics|Institute of Chemical Physics]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] who worked on the large particle accelerator for conversion of [[uranium-238]] into [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium-239]].<ref name=Protvinonews>[http://www.protvino.ru/news/121/ ''\"Vladimir Teplyakov\"''] Retrieved on December 12, 2009</ref> From 1959 to 1966 he worked at [[Snezhinsk|Chelyabinsk-70]] to develop a high-current proton [[linear accelerator]] for controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]]. In mid 60's, together with G.M. Anisimov, Teplyakov conceived the idea of focusing the charged particle beams by the radio-frequency (RF) accelerating electromagnetic field rather than by solenoid magnets. This work continued at the [[Institute for High Energy Physics]] (IHEP) in [[Protvino]], where his group moved in 1966 to build the I-100, a 100 MeV Alvarez drift-tube linac, which was an injector to the [[U-70 (synchrotron)|U-70]], a 70 GeV proton [[synchrotron]], the world's largest particle accelerator at that time.<ref name=IFMIF/><ref>{{cite web|title=Vladimir Aleksandrovich Teplyakov, Translation from Atomnaya Energiya, Vol. 99| date = November 5, 2005 | url = http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=a66375864pp587wm&size=largest| accessdate = 2009-12-14}}</ref>\n\nBy late 60's, Teplyakov and I.M. Kapchinsky developed the concept of the [[radio-frequency quadrupole]] (RFQ) where accelerating gaps are supplemented with spacer electrodes charged under an intermediate potential. Such a focusing system resulted in a noticeable upgrade in performance and a significant decrease of the dimensions of the drift tubes. Teplyakov subsequently developed several RFQ drift-tube structures and RF cavities to drive them.<ref name=IFMIF/><ref>{{cite web|author=Yu.

In mid 60\u2019s, together with G.M. Anisimov, Teplyakov conceived the idea of focusing the charged particle beams by the radio-frequency (RF) accelerating electromagnetic field rather than by solenoid magnets. This work continued at the [[Institute for High Energy Physics]] (IHEP) in [[Protvino]], where his group moved in 1966 to build the I-100, a 100 MeV Alvarez drift-tube linac, which was an injector to the [[U-70 (synchrotron)|U-70]], a 70 GeV proton [[synchrotron]], the world's largest particle accelerator at that time.<ref name=IFMIF/><ref>{{cite web|title=Vladimir Aleksandrovich Teplyakov, Translation from Atomnaya Energiya, Vol. 99| date = November 5, 2005 | url = http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=a66375864pp587wm&size=largest| accessdate = 2009-12-14}}</ref>\n\nBy late 60's, Teplyakov and I.M. Kapchinsky developed the concept of the [[radio-frequency quadrupole]] (RFQ) where accelerating gaps are supplemented with spacer electrodes charged under an intermediate potential. Such a focusing system resulted in a noticeable upgrade in performance and a significant decrease of the dimensions of the drift tubes.

The book's [[manifesto]] is directed toward increasing art's engagement with the reality of contemporary life through the exploration of hybrid genres such as [[prose poetry]] and literary collage. In ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Elissa Schappell called ''Reality Hunger'' \"a rousing call to arms for all artists to reject the laws governing appropriation, obliterate the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, and give rise to a new modern form for a new century.\"\n\n\n==Structure==\n''Reality Hunger'' consists of 618 numbered passages divided into twenty-six chapters.

According to his argument, traditional genres, such as [[realist fiction]], are failing to adequately reflect lived reality because they have gone largely unchanged since their early development, and are therefore obsessed with current events because society rarely experiences any.\n\nThe role of plagiarism in art also constitutes a major theme. Shields argues that plagiarism is something that artists have always partaken in, and that only recently has the act acquired the stigma it has, due in large part to copyright legislation and the culture surrounding it. Rather than shy away from wholesale appropriation, Shields encourages it, stating that \u201creality-based art hijacks its material and doesn\u2019t apologize.\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=91}}</ref> In support of this argument, the work includes a chapter on hip-hop, which, in addition to examining other facets of the genre, discusses the genre's use of [[DJing]], [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], and [[Remix|remixing]]. <ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=87}}</ref> \n\nShields also discusses, at length, the distinction between memoir and fiction-a distinction that, Shields argues, is mostly imaginary. Because writers of fiction implement a great deal of material directly from their lives, and because writers of memoir must rely on memories that don't necessarily reflect the truth of what occurred, it would seem absurd to hold the two different kinds of writer to such different standards. \u201cAnything processed by memory is fiction,\u201d Shields writes, indicating that anything written by a writer supposedly doing memoir has necessarily already been fictionalized; thus, determining whether certain events in the book actually happened or not is not the correct way to determine the book's value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=57}}</ref> The scandal surrounding [[James Frey]]\u2019s [[A Million Little Pieces]] figures largely in one chapter, as Shields argues that Frey's mistake was not lying in his so-called memoir but apologizing about it afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed not that Frey is a liar but that he isn\u2019t a better one,\u201d Shields writes. \u201cHe should have said, \u2018Everyone who writes about himself is a liar. I created a person meaner, funnier, more filled with life than I could ever be\u2019. . . Instead, he showed up for his whipping.\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=43}}</ref>\n\nShields also places great importance on working in and creating new artistic forms, emphasizing in particular that the boundaries of genre (which he refers to as a \u201cminimum-security prison\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=70}}</ref>) should constantly be bent and broken. An entire chapter is devoted to [[collage]] (a genre or \"antigenre\" of which ''Reality Hunger'' itself is explicitly a member), which Shields praises as \u201can evolution beyond narrative<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=115}}</ref>\u201d because it does not, he argues, reinforce false ideas about the world such as the inevitability of resolution that traditional narrative does: \u201cStory seems to say that everything happens for a reason and I want to say, No, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=114}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nReviews of ''Reality Hunger'' were generally favorable. Shortly after its release, [[Chuck Klosterman]] tweeted that it \u2018\u2018might be the most intense, thought-accelerating book of the last 10 years.\u201d Luc Sante wrote in the [[New York Times Book Review]] that the book \u201curgently and succinctly addresses matters that have been in the air, have relentlessly gathered momentum, and have just been waiting for someone to link them together. . . . [Shields's] book probably heralds what will be the dominant modes in years and decades to come.\u2019\u2019<ref name=nyt/>\n\nThe book also evoked a substantial amount of controversy, most of which centered around Shields's claims about the death of the novel and his advocacy of artistic plagiarism. [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] was one of the book's most prominent critics, describing it in his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as \"highly problematic\" in its \u201cunexamined promotion of what he insists on calling 'reality' over narrative.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Wood |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/03/15/100315crat_atlarge_wood?currentPage=2 |title=Chang-Rae Lee's \u201cThe Surrendered,\u201d review |publisher=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Memoirs]]\n*[[Literary theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Shields|first=David|title=Reality Hunger: a Manifesto|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=2010}}\n\n==External links==\n*Shields [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270740/april-14-2010/david-shields interview] at ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (April 2010)\n\n{{Appropriation in the arts}}\n\n[[Category:Collage]]\n[[Category:2010 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Manifestos]]\n[[Category:American non-fiction books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox book| <!--See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->   \n  | name           =  Reality Hunger\n  | title_orig     =  \n  | translator     =  \n  | image          = Reality Hunger.jpg\n| image_caption  =  \n  | author         =  David Shields\n  | illustrator    =  \n  | cover_artist   =  \n  | country        =  United States\n  |\n  | subject        =  \n  | genre          =  [[Collage]]\n  | publisher      =  [[Alfred A.

Because writers of fiction implement a great deal of material directly from their lives, and because writers of memoir must rely on memories that don\u2019t necessarily reflect the truth of what occurred, it would seem absurd to hold the two different kinds of writer to such different standards. \u201cAnything processed by memory is fiction,\u201d Shields writes, indicating that anything written by a writer supposedly doing memoir has necessarily already been fictionalized; thus, determining whether certain events in the book actually happened or not is not the correct way to determine the book's value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=57}}</ref> The scandal surrounding [[James Frey]]\u2019s [[A Million Little Pieces]] figures largely in one chapter, as Shields argues that Frey's mistake was not lying in his so-called memoir but apologizing about it afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed not that Frey is a liar but that he isn\u2019t a better one,\u201d Shields writes. \u201cHe should have said, \u2018Everyone who writes about himself is a liar. I created a person meaner, funnier, more filled with life than I could ever be\u2019. . . Instead, he showed up for his whipping.\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=43}}</ref>\n\nShields also places great importance on working in and creating new artistic forms, emphasizing in particular that the boundaries of genre (which he refers to as a \u201cminimum-security prison\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=70}}</ref>) should constantly be bent and broken. An entire chapter is devoted to [[collage]] (a genre or \"antigenre\" of which ''Reality Hunger'' itself is explicitly a member), which Shields praises as \u201can evolution beyond narrative<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=115}}</ref>\u201d because it does not, he argues, reinforce false ideas about the world such as the inevitability of resolution that traditional narrative does: \u201cStory seems to say that everything happens for a reason and I want to say, No, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d<ref>{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=114}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nReviews of ''Reality Hunger'' were generally favorable. Shortly after its release, [[Chuck Klosterman]] tweeted that it \u2018\u2018might be the most intense, thought-accelerating book of the last 10 years.\u201d Luc Sante wrote in the [[New York Times Book Review]] that the book \u201curgently and succinctly addresses matters that have been in the air, have relentlessly gathered momentum, and have just been waiting for someone to link them together. . . . [Shields's] book probably heralds what will be the dominant modes in years and decades to come.\u2019\u2019<ref name=nyt/>\n\nThe book also evoked a substantial amount of controversy, most of which centered around Shields's claims about the death of the novel and his advocacy of artistic plagiarism. [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] was one of the book's most prominent critics, describing it in his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as \"highly problematic\" in its \u201cunexamined promotion of what he insists on calling 'reality' over narrative.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Wood |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/03/15/100315crat_atlarge_wood?currentPage=2 |title=Chang-Rae Lee's \u201cThe Surrendered,\u201d review |publisher=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Memoirs]]\n*[[Literary theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Shields|first=David|title=Reality Hunger: a Manifesto|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=2010}}\n\n==External links==\n*Shields [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270740/april-14-2010/david-shields interview] at ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (April 2010)\n\n{{Appropriation in the arts}}\n\n[[Category:Collage]]\n[[Category:2010 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Manifestos]]\n[[Category:American non-fiction books]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMajor themes:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: don\u2019t \u2192 don't", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Hunger"}
