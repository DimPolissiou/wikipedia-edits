He named it ''Staphylococcus'' after its clustered appearance evident under a microscope. Then, in 1884, German scientist [[Friedrich Julius Rosenbach]] identified ''Staphylococcus aureus'', discriminating and separating it from ''[[Staphylococcus albus]]'', a related bacterium. In the early 1930s, doctors began to use a more streamlined test to detect the presence of an ''S. aureus'' infection by the means of [[coagulase]] testing, which enables detection of an enzyme produced by the bacterium. Prior to the 1940s, ''S. aureus'' infections were fatal in the majority of patients. However, doctors discovered that the use of penicillin could cure ''S. aureus'' infections. Unfortunately, by the end of the 1940s, [[antibiotic resistance|penicillin resistance]] became widespread amongst this bacterium population and outbreaks of the resistant strain began to occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orent|first=W|date=2006|title=A Brief History of Staph|journal=Proto Magazine}}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n''Staphylococcus aureus'' can be sorted into ten dominant human lineages. There are numerous minor lineages as well, but these are not seen in the population as often. Genomes of bacteria within the same lineage are mostly conserved, with the exception of mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements that are common in ''S. aureus'' include bacteriophages, pathogenicity islands, plasmids, transposons, and staphylococcal cassette chromosomes. These elements have enabled ''S. aureus'' to continually evolve and gain new traits. There is a great deal of genetic variation within the ''S. aureus'' species''.'' A study by Fitzgerald et al. (2001) revealed that approximately 22% of the ''S. aureus'' genome is non-coding and thus can differ from bacterium to bacterium. An example of this difference is seen in the species' virulence. Only a few strains of ''S. aureus'' are associated with infections in humans. This demonstrates that there is a large range of infectious ability within the species.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fitzgerald JR, Sturdevant DE, Mackie SM, Gill SR, Musser JM | year = 2001 | title = Evolutionary genomics of ''Staphylococcus aureus'': insights into the origin of methicillin resistant strains and the toxic shock syndrome epidemic | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 98 | issue = 15| pages = 8821\u20138826 | doi=10.1073/pnas.161098098| pmid = 11447287 | pmc = 37519 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.8821F }}</ref>\n\nIt has been proposed that one possible reason for the great deal of heterogeneity within the species could be due to its reliance on heterogeneous infections. This occurs when multiple different types of ''S. aureus'' cause an infection within a host. The different strains can secrete different enzymes or bring different antibiotic resistances to the group, increasing its pathogenic ability.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | author = Lindsay JA | year = 2010 | title = Genomic variation and evolution of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 300 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 98\u2013103 | doi=10.1016/j.ijmm.2009.08.013| pmid = 19811948 }}</ref> Thus, there is a need for a large number of mutations and acquisitions of mobile genetic elements.\n\nAnother notable evolutionary process within the ''S. aureus'' species is its co-evolution with its human hosts. Over time, this parasitic relationship has led to the bacterium's ability to be carried in the nasopharynx of humans without causing symptoms or infection. This allows it to be passed throughout the human population, increasing its fitness as a species.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fitzgerald JR | year = 2014 | title = Evolution of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' during human colonization and infection | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 21 | pages = 542\u2013547 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2013.04.020| pmid = 23624187 }}</ref> However, only approximately 50% of the human population are carriers of ''S. aureus'', with 20% as continuous carriers and 30% as intermittent. This leads scientists to believe that there are many factors that determine whether ''S. aureus'' is carried asymptomatically in humans, including factors that are specific to an individual person. According to a 1995 study by Hofman et al., these factors may include age, sex, diabetes, and smoking. They also determined some genetic variations in humans that lead to an increased ability for ''S. aureus'' to colonize, notably a polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that results in larger [[corticosteroid]] production. In conclusion, there is evidence that any strain of this bacterium can become invasive, as this is highly dependent upon human factors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Van B, Melles D, Nouwen J, Van L, Van W, Vos M, Verbrugh H | year = 2009 | title = Co-evolutionary aspects of human colonisation and infection by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 32\u201347 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.012| pmid = 19000784 }}</ref>\n\nThough ''S. aureus'' has quick reproductive and micro-evolutionary rates, there are multiple barriers that prevent evolution with the species. One such barrier is AGR, which is a global accessory gene regulator within the bacteria. This such regulator has been linked to the virulence level of the bacteria. Loss of function mutations within this gene have been found to increase the fitness of the bacterium containing it. Thus, ''S. aureus'' must make a trade-off to increase their success as a species, exchanging reduced virulence for increased drug resistance. Another barrier to evolution is the Sau1 Type I restriction modification (RM) system. This system exists to protect the bacterium from foreign DNA by digesting it. Exchange of DNA between the same lineage is not blocked, since they have the same enzymes and the RM system does not recognize the new DNA as foreign, but transfer between lineages is blocked.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Microbiology ==\n[[Image:Staphylococcus aureus Gram.jpg|thumb|250px|Gram stain of ''[[S. saprophyticus]]'' cells, which typically occur in clusters: The cell wall readily absorbs the [[crystal violet]] stain.]]\n[[File:Staphylococcus aureus biochemical tests for identification.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Key characteristics of ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]\n''S. aureus'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|s|t|\u00e6|f|\u1d7b|l|\u0259|\u02c8|k|\u0252|k|\u0259|s|_|\u02c8|\u0254\u02d0r|i|\u0259|s|,_|-|l|o\u028a|-}},{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Staphylococcus}} {{Dictionary.com|aureus}}}}{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/staphylococcus |title=staphylococcus \u2013 definition of staphylococcus in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=20 January 2016 }} {{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aureus |title=aureus \u2013 definition of aureus in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=20 January 2016 }}}} [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"grape-cluster berry\", [[Latin]] ''aureus'', \"golden\") is a [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobic]], Gram-positive [[coccus|coccal]] (round) bacterium also known as \"golden staph\" and \"oro staphira\".

An antibiotic derived from some ''[[Penicillium]]'' [[fungus|fungal]] species, penicillin inhibits the formation of [[peptidoglycan]] cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a [[Cell wall#Bacterial cell walls|bacterial cell wall]]. The four-membered \u03b2-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase]], an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of \u03b2-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme's functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant [[\u03b2-lactam antibiotic]] (for example, [[oxacillin]] or [[flucloxacillin]], both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin).

He named it ''Staphylococcus'' after its clustered appearance evident under a microscope. Then, in 1884, German scientist [[Friedrich Julius Rosenbach]] identified ''Staphylococcus aureus'', discriminating and separating it from ''[[Staphylococcus albus]]'', a related bacterium. In the early 1930s, doctors began to use a more streamlined test to detect the presence of an ''S. aureus'' infection by the means of [[coagulase]] testing, which enables detection of an enzyme produced by the bacterium. Prior to the 1940s, ''S. aureus'' infections were fatal in the majority of patients. However, doctors discovered that the use of penicillin could cure ''S. aureus'' infections. Unfortunately, by the end of the 1940s, [[antibiotic resistance|penicillin resistance]] became widespread amongst this bacterium population and outbreaks of the resistant strain began to occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orent|first=W|date=2006|title=A Brief History of Staph|journal=Proto Magazine}}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n''Staphylococcus aureus'' can be sorted into ten dominant human lineages. There are numerous minor lineages as well, but these are not seen in the population as often. Genomes of bacteria within the same lineage are mostly conserved, with the exception of mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements that are common in ''S. aureus'' include bacteriophages, pathogenicity islands, plasmids, transposons, and staphylococcal cassette chromosomes. These elements have enabled ''S. aureus'' to continually evolve and gain new traits. There is a great deal of genetic variation within the ''S. aureus'' species''.'' A study by Fitzgerald et al. (2001) revealed that approximately 22% of the ''S. aureus'' genome is non-coding and thus can differ from bacterium to bacterium. An example of this difference is seen in the species' virulence. Only a few strains of ''S. aureus'' are associated with infections in humans. This demonstrates that there is a large range of infectious ability within the species.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fitzgerald JR, Sturdevant DE, Mackie SM, Gill SR, Musser JM | year = 2001 | title = Evolutionary genomics of ''Staphylococcus aureus'': insights into the origin of methicillin resistant strains and the toxic shock syndrome epidemic | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 98 | issue = 15| pages = 8821\u20138826 | doi=10.1073/pnas.161098098| pmid = 11447287 | pmc = 37519 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.8821F }}</ref>\n\nIt has been proposed that one possible reason for the great deal of heterogeneity within the species could be due to its reliance on heterogeneous infections. This occurs when multiple different types of ''S. aureus'' cause an infection within a host. The different strains can secrete different enzymes or bring different antibiotic resistances to the group, increasing its pathogenic ability.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | author = Lindsay JA | year = 2010 | title = Genomic variation and evolution of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 300 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 98\u2013103 | doi=10.1016/j.ijmm.2009.08.013| pmid = 19811948 }}</ref> Thus, there is a need for a large number of mutations and acquisitions of mobile genetic elements.\n\nAnother notable evolutionary process within the ''S. aureus'' species is its co-evolution with its human hosts. Over time, this parasitic relationship has led to the bacterium's ability to be carried in the nasopharynx of humans without causing symptoms or infection. This allows it to be passed throughout the human population, increasing its fitness as a species.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fitzgerald JR | year = 2014 | title = Evolution of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' during human colonization and infection | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 21 | pages = 542\u2013547 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2013.04.020| pmid = 23624187 }}</ref> However, only approximately 50% of the human population are carriers of ''S. aureus'', with 20% as continuous carriers and 30% as intermittent. This leads scientists to believe that there are many factors that determine whether ''S. aureus'' is carried asymptomatically in humans, including factors that are specific to an individual person. According to a 1995 study by Hofman et al., these factors may include age, sex, diabetes, and smoking. They also determined some genetic variations in humans that lead to an increased ability for ''S. aureus'' to colonize, notably a polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that results in larger [[corticosteroid]] production. In conclusion, there is evidence that any strain of this bacterium can become invasive, as this is highly dependent upon human factors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Van B, Melles D, Nouwen J, Van L, Van W, Vos M, Verbrugh H | year = 2009 | title = Co-evolutionary aspects of human colonisation and infection by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 32\u201347 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.012| pmid = 19000784 }}</ref>\n\nThough ''S. aureus'' has quick reproductive and micro-evolutionary rates, there are multiple barriers that prevent evolution with the species. One such barrier is AGR, which is a global accessory gene regulator within the bacteria. This such regulator has been linked to the virulence level of the bacteria. Loss of function mutations within this gene have been found to increase the fitness of the bacterium containing it. Thus, ''S. aureus'' must make a trade-off to increase their success as a species, exchanging reduced virulence for increased drug resistance. Another barrier to evolution is the Sau1 Type I restriction modification (RM) system. This system exists to protect the bacterium from foreign DNA by digesting it. Exchange of DNA between the same lineage is not blocked, since they have the same enzymes and the RM system does not recognize the new DNA as foreign, but transfer between lineages is blocked.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Microbiology ==\n[[Image:Staphylococcus aureus Gram.jpg|thumb|250px|Gram stain of ''[[S. saprophyticus]]'' cells, which typically occur in clusters: The cell wall readily absorbs the [[crystal violet]] stain.]]\n[[File:Staphylococcus aureus biochemical tests for identification.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Key characteristics of ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]\n''S. aureus'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|s|t|\u00e6|f|\u1d7b|l|\u0259|\u02c8|k|\u0252|k|\u0259|s|_|\u02c8|\u0254\u02d0r|i|\u0259|s|,_|-|l|o\u028a|-}},{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Staphylococcus}} {{Dictionary.com|aureus}}}}{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/staphylococcus |title=staphylococcus \u2013 definition of staphylococcus in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=20 January 2016 }} {{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aureus |title=aureus \u2013 definition of aureus in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=20 January 2016 }}}} [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"grape-cluster berry\", [[Latin]] ''aureus'', \"golden\") is a [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobic]], Gram-positive [[coccus|coccal]] (round) bacterium also known as \"golden staph\" and \"oro staphira\".

An antibiotic derived from some ''[[Penicillium]]'' [[fungus|fungal]] species, penicillin inhibits the formation of [[peptidoglycan]] cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a [[Cell wall#Bacterial cell walls|bacterial cell wall]]. The four-membered \u03b2-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase]], an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of \u03b2-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme's functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant [[\u03b2-lactam antibiotic]] (for example, [[oxacillin]] or [[flucloxacillin]], both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin).

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft's writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329210515/http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |archive-date=March 29, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n{{Clear|left}}\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with barge approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in [[Lincoln Park (Duluth)|Lincoln Park]], an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to the growing revitalization of this neighborhood, many developers are also investing in increased housing projects in anticipation of local growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/real-estate/4984156-Following-business-boom-Duluth%E2%80%99s-Lincoln-Park-sees-housing-influx|title=Following business boom, Duluth\u2019s Lincoln Park sees housing influx|last=Busche|first=Kelly|date=March 9th, 2020|website=Duluth News Tribune|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 25th, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports.

Duluth and Lake Superior coast are visible at far left]]\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, so Duluth is primarily a southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways.

As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city.

Not a commercial success, the flights ended later that summer when the designer of the aircraft's engine crashed it. After being purchased and used for scheduled flights in Florida, the plane returned to Duluth and other locations for passenger flights in 1914, until it was ultimately damaged in a hard landing later that year in California and pronounced unsalvageable.

A 4.2-mile lakewalk cuts through the area, offering a view of Park Point's extensive sandy dunes and beaches. Swimming is an option, though few are willing to swim in Lake Superior's icy waters.

The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs, using their voices to entertain the crowd. Recorded by [[Merv Griffin]] in 1962, the \"Christmas City\" song is the parade's signature sound. According to Rich's grandson, the song was written by a local resident and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin, at that time not the well-known TV personality he later became, if he would sing the song and put it to music.<ref>[http://christmascityparade.com/ Christmas City of the North Parade:<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072214/http://christmascityparade.com/ |date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ Grandson of Christmas City Parade Creator Shares History | Christmas City of the North Parade<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902015321/http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ |date=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n====Gichi-Ode' Akiing====\n[[File:Mural at Gichi-Ode' Akiing Park.jpg|thumb|alt=Red, green, black, yellow and blue figures outlined in black|Gichi-Ode' Akiing memorial for [[Kechewaishke]]]]\nJust off the Lakewalk, Lake Place Park became Gichi-Ode' Akiing, Ojibwe for ''\"a grand heart place.\"''<ref>{{cite news|title=Ceremony Friday to rename Lake Place Park as Gichi-ode\u2019 Akiing|author=News Tribune|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|publisher=Duluth News Tribune and Forum Communications Company|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/incoming/1354590-Ceremony-Friday-to-rename-Lake-Place-Park-as-Gichi-ode%E2%80%99-Akiing|newspaper=Duluth News Tribune}}</ref> The [[Duluth City Council]] approved the name change in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth renames city park in the Ojibwe language|author=Kraker, Dan|date=June 1, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/01/duluth-renames-city-park-ojibwe-language|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref> A memorial to [[Kechewaishke]], also known as Chief Buffalo, honors his symbolic petition carried to president [[Millard Fillmore]] in 1849.<ref name=WIHS>{{cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM1871|title=Symbolic Petition of the Chippewa Chiefs|accessdate=April 4, 2020|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society}}</ref> Kechewaishke signed the [[Treaty_of_La_Pointe#1854_Treaty_of_La_Pointe|1854 Treaty of La Pointe]] a year before his death, with the provision that one square mile of land at the corner of Lake Superior be given to his adopted son [[Benjamin G.

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

A [[Duluth pack]] is a traditional [[portage]] pack used in canoe travel. A specialized type of backpack, Duluth packs are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier. Arriving in Duluth in 1870 with a small stock of leather and tools, he began a shoe store and quickly made a go of it in what was then a booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]]. Although not the first elevator, the design was important for improving the method of opening and closing elevator doors, as well as closing the opening to the elevator shaft when an elevator was between floors. At that time, elevator patrons or operators were required to manually shut a door to cut off access to the shaft, and Miles created an automatic mechanism that closed that access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_Alexander_Miles.htm|title=How Black Inventor Alexander Miles Improved Elevator Safety|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===First whole-plane parachute system on a certified aircraft===\n\n{{Main|Cirrus Airframe Parachute System}}\n[[File:Caps deploy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Cirrus Airframe Parachute System]] deployment (1998)]]\n \t\t \t\nIn association with southern Minnesota company [[Ballistic Recovery Systems]] (BRS), Duluth-based aircraft manufacturing company [[Cirrus Aircraft]] developed the [[Cirrus Airframe Parachute System]] (CAPS), the first whole-plane, emergency parachute recovery system to be installed on a line of [[type certification|type certified]] aircraft, the [[Cirrus SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]].<ref name=TheAtlantic/> A [[solid-fuel rocket]] housed in the [[fuselage]] is used to pull the parachute out from its housing and deploy the canopy full within seconds.

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft's writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329210515/http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |archive-date=March 29, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n{{Clear|left}}\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with barge approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

Duluth has been called \"the San Francisco of the Midwest,\" alluding to [[San Francisco]]'s similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The [[weather station]] at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).<ref name=wunderground>{{cite web|title=Duluth, Minnesota|publisher=The Weather Underground, Inc.

Duluth and Lake Superior coast are visible at far left]]\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, so Duluth is primarily a southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:Large anorthosite xenolith in ophitic ilmenite gabbro (anorthosite series, Duluth Complex, Mesoproterozoic, 1099 Ma; Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) 1 (22039818790).jpg|thumb|Large [[anorthosite]] [[xenolith]] in ophitic ilmenite gabbro, Duluth Complex, Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota]]\n[[File:Agat Lake Superior - Duluth, Minnesota, USA..jpg|thumb|[[Lake Superior agate]] - Duluth, Minnesota]]\n\nThe geology of Duluth demonstrates the [[Midcontinent Rift]], formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior.

The average annual snowfall is 81.5 in.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city. Mayor Don Ness called it \"the single most important volunteer effort in our city's history.\" After reforming and restructuring the benefits and a court case that went all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, in 2013 the liability stood at an estimated $191 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/business/yourmoney/11retire.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Milt | last1=Freudenheim | title=The Next Retirement Time Bomb | date=December 11, 2005}}</ref> In 2014, the mayor announced \"a full solution for the retiree health care issue that once threatened to bankrupt our city.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth mayor touts plan for retiree health care|url=http://www.twincities.com/2014/10/07/duluth-mayor-touts-plan-for-retiree-health-care/|access-date=April 23, 2017|publisher=Pioneer Press|date=October 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085535/http://www.twincities.com/2014/10/07/duluth-mayor-touts-plan-for-retiree-health-care/|archive-date=April 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Largest Employers in Duluth (2005)\n|-\n!

Not a commercial success, the flights ended later that summer when the designer of the aircraft's engine crashed it.

The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs, using their voices to entertain the crowd. Recorded by [[Merv Griffin]] in 1962, the \"Christmas City\" song is the parade's signature sound. According to Rich's grandson, the song was written by a local resident and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin, at that time not the well-known TV personality he later became, if he would sing the song and put it to music.<ref>[http://christmascityparade.com/ Christmas City of the North Parade:<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072214/http://christmascityparade.com/ |date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ Grandson of Christmas City Parade Creator Shares History | Christmas City of the North Parade<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902015321/http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ |date=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n====Gichi-Ode' Akiing====\n[[File:Mural at Gichi-Ode' Akiing Park.jpg|thumb|alt=Red, green, black, yellow and blue figures outlined in black|Gichi-Ode' Akiing memorial for [[Kechewaishke]]]]\nJust off the Lakewalk, Lake Place Park became Gichi-Ode' Akiing, Ojibwe for ''\"a grand heart place.\"''<ref>{{cite news|title=Ceremony Friday to rename Lake Place Park as Gichi-ode\u2019 Akiing|author=News Tribune|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|publisher=Duluth News Tribune and Forum Communications Company|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/incoming/1354590-Ceremony-Friday-to-rename-Lake-Place-Park-as-Gichi-ode%E2%80%99-Akiing|newspaper=Duluth News Tribune}}</ref> The [[Duluth City Council]] approved the name change in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth renames city park in the Ojibwe language|author=Kraker, Dan|date=June 1, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/01/duluth-renames-city-park-ojibwe-language|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref> A memorial to [[Kechewaishke]], also known as Chief Buffalo, honors his symbolic petition carried to president [[Millard Fillmore]] in 1849.<ref name=WIHS>{{cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM1871|title=Symbolic Petition of the Chippewa Chiefs|accessdate=April 4, 2020|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society}}</ref> Kechewaishke signed the [[Treaty_of_La_Pointe#1854_Treaty_of_La_Pointe|1854 Treaty of La Pointe]] a year before his death, with the provision that one square mile of land at the corner of Lake Superior be given to his adopted son [[Benjamin G.

In Duluth the right season for surfing is winter, especially during one of Lake Superior's infamous [[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|gales of November]]. Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

He rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a [[Shakespearean]] stage actor and went on to appear in more than 70 films, primarily costume dramas, [[swashbuckler]]s and, occasionally, horror films.\n\nRathbone frequently portrayed suave villains or morally ambiguous characters, such as [[Edward Murdstone|Mr. Murdstone]] in ''[[David Copperfield (1935 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1935) and [[Sir Guy of Gisbourne]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938). His most famous role was that of [[Sherlock Holmes]] in [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|fourteen Hollywood films made between 1939 and 1946]] and in a radio series. His later career included roles on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], as well as self-ironic film and television work. He received a [[Tony Award]] in 1948 as [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play|Best Actor in a Play]]. He was also nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] and was honoured with three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}\nRathbone was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South African Republic|South Africa]],<ref name=\"baptism\">\"South Africa, Church of the Province of South Africa, Parish Registers, 1801-2004,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVSH-SB15 : 16 August 2019), Philip St John Basil Rathbone, 26 Mar 1894; citing Baptism, Transvaal, South Africa, p. , William Cullen Library, Wits University, Johannesburg.</ref> to British parents. His mother, Anna Barbara (n\u00e9e George), was a violinist, and his father, Edgar Philip Rathbone, was a mining engineer and scion of the [[Liverpool]] [[Rathbone family]]. He had two older half-brothers, Harold and Horace, as well as two younger siblings, Beatrice and John. Basil was the great-grandson of the noted Victorian philanthropist, [[William Rathbone V]], and thus a descendant of [[William Rathbone II]]. The Rathbones fled to Britain when Basil was three years old when his father was accused by the [[Boer]]s of being a spy after the [[Jameson Raid]]. He was a distant cousin of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Colonel]] [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present at the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], and was seriously wounded trying to stop [[John Wilkes Booth]].\n\nRathbone attended [[Repton School]] in [[Derbyshire]] from 1906 to 1910, where he excelled at sports and was given the nickname \"Ratters\" by schoolmates. Thereafter, he was briefly employed as an insurance clerk by the Liverpool and Globe Insurance Companies,<ref name=\"1911census\">\"England and Wales Census, 1911,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XWG3-B6W : 8 May 2019), Basil Philip St John Rathbone in household of Colin Forsyth Burn, Stoke Newington, London, England, United Kingdom; from \"1911 England and Wales census,\" database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing PRO RG 14, The National Archives of the UK, Kew, Surrey.</ref> to appease his father's wish for him to have a conventional career.<ref>[http://www.basilrathbone.net/biography/ basilrathbone.net] Retrieved 22 May 2018.</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1911, Rathbone made his first appearance on stage at the Theatre Royal, [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], as Hortensio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', with his cousin Sir Frank Benson's No. 2 Company, under the direction of [[Henry Herbert (actor)|Henry Herbert]]. In October 1912, he went to the United States with Benson's company, playing such parts as Paris in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Fenton in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', and Silvius in ''[[As You Like It]]''. Returning to Britain, he made his first appearance in London at the [[Savoy Theatre]] on 9 July 1914, as Finch in ''The Sin of David''. That December, he appeared at the [[Original Shaftesbury Theatre|Shaftesbury Theatre]] as the Dauphin in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. During 1915, he toured with Benson and appeared with him at London's Court Theatre in December as Lysander in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\n\n==Military service==\nDuring the [[First World War]], Rathbone was called up in 1915 via the [[Derby Scheme]] into the [[British Army]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] with the [[London Scottish Regiment]], joining a regiment that also included his future professional acting contemporaries [[Claude Rains]], [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[Ronald Colman]] at different points through the conflict. After [[basic training]] with the London Scots in early 1916 he received a commission as a [[lieutenant]] in the 2/10th Battalion of the King's Liverpool Regiment ([[Liverpool Scottish]]), where he served as an [[intelligence officer]] and attained the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].  Basil Rathbone was twice the British Army Fencing Champ, a skill that would serve him well in movies and allow him to even teach actors Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power the finer art of swordsmanship. Rathbone's younger brother John was killed in action on 4 June 1918.<ref>\"Famous 1914-18,\"  Richard Van Emden, 2010, p. 132</ref> In 2012 two letters Rathbone wrote to his family while serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were published. One reveals the anguish and anger he felt following the death of his brother, John:\n\n<blockquote> I want to tell him to mind his place. I think of his ridiculous belief that everything would always be well, his ever-hopeful smile, and I want to cuff him for a little fool. He had no business to let it happen and it maddens me that I shall never be able to tell him so, or change it or bring him back. I can\u2019t think of him without being consumed with anger at him for being dead and beyond anything I can do to him.\n:\u2014 26 July 1918<ref name=\"army\">{{cite web|url=http://www.basilrathbone.net/biography/ww1.htm |title=Basil Rathbone, Master of Stage and Screen: The Great War |publisher=Basilrathbone.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing his brother's death, Rathbone appears to have become unconcerned about the dangers of serving at the front. Author [[Richard Van Emden]] in ''Famous 1914\u201318'' speculates that his extreme bravery may have been a form of guilt or need for vengeance.<ref>''Famous 1914\u201318'',  Richard Van Emden, 2010, p. 134</ref> He persuaded his superiors to allow him to scout enemy positions during daylight rather than at night, as was the usual practice to minimise the chance of detection.<ref>{{Youtube|g2Fl8zYO9u8|title=A 1957 interview with Basil Rathbone talking about WWI}}</ref> Rathbone wore a special camouflage suit that resembled a tree with a wreath of freshly plucked foliage on his head with burnt cork applied to his hands and face.<ref>''In and Out of Character'', Basil Rathbone, 1962, p. 2</ref> As a result of these highly dangerous daylight reconnaissance missions in September 1918, he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for \"conspicuous daring and resource on patrol\".<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30997 |supp=y |date=5 November 1918 |page=13166}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDuring the Summer Festival of 1919, he appeared at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] with the New Shakespeare Company playing Romeo, Cassius, Ferdinand in ''[[The Tempest]]'' and Florizel in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''; in October he was at London's [[Queen's Theatre]] as the aide de camp in ''Napoleon'', and in February 1920 he was at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the title role in ''[[Peter Ibbetson (play)|Peter Ibbetson]]'' with huge success.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Rathbone appeared regularly in Shakespearean and other roles on the British stage. He began to travel and appeared at the [[Cort Theatre]], [[New York City|New York]], in October 1923 in a production of ''[[The Swan (ballet)|The Swan]]'' opposite [[Eva Le Gallienne]], which made him a star on Broadway. He toured in the United States in 1925, appearing in [[San Francisco]] in May and the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]], New York, in October. He was in the US again in 1927 and 1930 and again in 1931, when he appeared on stage with [[Ethel Barrymore]]. He continued his stage career in Britain, returning late in 1934 to the US, where he appeared with [[Katharine Cornell]] in several plays.\n\nRathbone was once arrested in 1926 along with every other member of the cast of ''[[The Captive (play)|The Captive]]'', a play in which his character's wife left him for another woman. Though the charges were eventually dropped, Rathbone was very angry about the censorship because he believed that [[homosexuality]] needed to be brought into the open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/wiki/New_York_Times:_Reaction_to_%22The_Captive%22,_1926-1927 |title=New York Times: Reaction to 'The Captive', 1926-1927 - OutHistory |work=outhistory.org |year=2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basilrathbone.net/biography/ |title=Basil Rathbone, Master of Stage and Screen: Biography |publisher=Basilrathbone.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Romeo and Juliet lobby card 2.jpg|thumb|right|With [[John Barrymore]] and [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] in ''Romeo and Juliet'', 1936]]\nHe commenced his film career in 1921 in silent movies and appeared in 1923's \"School for Scandal\", later appearing in ''[[The Masked Bride]]'', appeared in a few [[silent film]]s, and played the detective [[Philo Vance]] in the 1930 film ''[[The Bishop Murder Case (film)|The Bishop Murder Case]]'', based on the best selling novel. In the film there is a coincidental reference to Sherlock Holmes. Like [[George Sanders]] and [[Vincent Price]] after him, Rathbone made a name for himself in the 1930s by playing suave villains in costume dramas and swashbucklers, including ''[[Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger|David Copperfield]]'' (1935) as the abusive stepfather Mr. Murdstone; ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935) as her distant husband, Karenin; ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) as [[Pontius Pilate]]; ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935); ''[[A Tale of Two Cities (1935 film)|A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1935), as the Marquis St. Evremonde; ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (movie)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938) playing his best-remembered villain, Sir [[Guy of Gisbourne]]; ''[[The Adventures of Marco Polo]]'' (1938); and ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) as Captain Esteban Pasquale. He also appeared in several early horror films: ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1939), as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), portraying the dedicated surgeon [[Wolf Frankenstein|Baron Wolf von Frankenstein]], son of [[Frankenstein's monster|the monster]]'s creator, and, in 1949, was also the narrator for the segment \"The Wind in the Willows\" in the Disney animated feature, ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''.\n\nHe was admired for his athletic cinema swordsmanship (he listed [[fencing]] among his favourite recreations). He fought and lost to [[Errol Flynn]] in a duel on the beach in ''Captain Blood'' and in an elaborate fight sequence in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''. He was also involved in noteworthy sword fights in ''Tower of London'', ''The Mark of Zorro'', and ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956). Despite his real life skill, Rathbone won only twice on screen, against [[John Barrymore]] in ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1936) and against [[Eugene Pallette]] in ''The Mark of Zorro'' (1940). Rathbone earned [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] for his performances as Tybalt in ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1936) and as King [[Louis XI]] in ''[[If I Were King]]'' (1938), a truly remarkable, comedic performance as the wily king. In ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'' (1938), he played one of his few heroic roles in the 1930s, as a [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) squadron commander brought to the brink of a [[nervous breakdown]] by the strain and guilt of sending his battle-weary pilots off to near-certain death in the skies of 1915 France. Errol Flynn, Rathbone's perennial foe, starred in the film as his successor when Rathbone's character was promoted.\n\nAccording to Hollywood legend, Rathbone was [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s first choice to play [[Rhett Butler]] in the film version of her novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. The reliability of this story may be suspect, however, as on another occasion Mitchell chose [[Groucho Marx]] for the role, apparently in jest. Rathbone actively campaigned for the role, however, but to no avail.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nDespite his film success, Rathbone always insisted that he wished to be remembered for his stage career. He said that his favourite role was that of Romeo.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} \n\n===The Sherlock Holmes films===\n[[File:Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes.jpeg|thumb|Basil Rathbone as [[Sherlock Holmes]]]]\n{{main article|Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)}}\nRathbone is most widely recognised for his many portrayals of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. In a radio interview Rathbone recalled that [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] producer and director [[Gene Markey]], lunching with producer-director-actor [[Gregory Ratoff]] and 20th Century-Fox mogul [[Daryl Zanuck]] at Lucey's Restaurant in [[Hollywood]], proposed a film version of [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''. When asked who could possibly play Holmes, Markey incredulously replied, \"''Who?!'' Basil Rathbone!\" The film was so successful that Fox produced a sequel which appeared later in 1939. Interest in Holmes cooled at Fox, but [[Universal Pictures]] picked up the character, and twelve feature films were made between 1941 and 1944 for release until 1947, all of which co-starred [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Dr. Watson]].\n\nThe first two films, ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (both produced by Fox in 1939), were set in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] of the original stories. The later instalments, produced by Universal, beginning with ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942), were set in contemporary times. The first three had [[World War II]]-related plots.\n\nConcurrent with the films, Rathbone and Bruce reprised their film roles in a radio series, ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', which began in October 1939. Rathbone appeared in the radio series as long as the film series was active, but after the films lapsed in 1946, Rathbone ceded his radio part to [[Tom Conway]]. Conway and Bruce carried on with the series for two seasons, until both dropped out in July 1947.\n\nThe many Holmes sequels [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] Rathbone, and he was unable to shake himself completely free from the shadow of the Great Detective despite appearing in other film roles. Resenting the typecasting, Rathbone refused to renew his contract at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and returned to Broadway. In later years, however, Rathbone willingly made the Holmes association, as in a TV sketch with [[Milton Berle]] in the early 1950s, in which he donned the [[deerstalker]] cap and [[Inverness cape]]. In the 1960s, dressed as Holmes, he appeared in a series of TV commercials for Getz Exterminators (\"Getz gets 'em, since 1888!'\").\n\nRathbone also brought Holmes to the stage in a play written by his wife Ouida. [[Thomas Gomez]], who had appeared as a [[Nazi]] ringleader in ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'', played the villainous [[Professor Moriarty]]. Nigel Bruce was slated to portray Dr Watson once more but became too ill and the part was played by character actor [[Jack Raine]]. Bruce's absence depressed Rathbone, particularly after Bruce died on 8 October 1953, while the play was in rehearsals. The play ran for only three performances.\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1950s, Rathbone appeared in two spoofs of his earlier swashbuckling villains: ''[[Casanova's Big Night]]'' (1954) opposite [[Bob Hope]] and ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956) with [[Danny Kaye]]. He appeared frequently on TV game shows and continued to appear in major films, including the [[Humphrey Bogart]] comedy ''[[We're No Angels (1955 film)|We're No Angels]]'' (1955) and [[John Ford]]'s political drama ''[[The Last Hurrah (1958 film)|The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958).\n\nRathbone also appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] numerous times. In 1948, he won a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor for his performance as the unyielding Dr. Austin Sloper in the original production of ''The Heiress'', which featured [[Wendy Hiller]] as his timid, spinster daughter. He also received accolades for his performance in [[Archibald Macleish]]'s ''[[J.B. (play)|J.B.]]'', a modernisation of the Biblical trials of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]].\n\nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, he continued to appear in several dignified anthology programmes on television. To support his second wife's lavish tastes, he appeared as a panelist on the television game show ''[[The Name's the Same]]'' (in 1954), and he also took roles in cheap film thrillers of far lesser quality, such as ''[[The Black Sleep]]'' (1956), ''[[Queen of Blood]]'' (1966), ''[[The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini]]'' (1966, wherein the character ' Eric Von Zipper' played by [[Harvey Lembeck]] jokes, \"That guy looks like Sherlock Holmes\"), ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967, also featuring [[Lon Chaney Jr]] and [[John Carradine]]), and his last film, a low budget, [[Mexico|Mexican]] horror film called ''Autopsy of a Ghost'' (1968).\n\nHe is also known for his [[spoken word]] recordings, including his interpretation of [[Clement C. Moore]]'s \"[[The Night Before Christmas]]\". Rathbone's readings of the stories and poems of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] are collected together with readings by [[Vincent Price]] in [[Caedmon Audio]]'s ''The Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection'' on CD. \n\nIn four Caedmon albums Rathbone revisited his characterization of Sherlock Holmes. The first, \"The Speckled Band\" (Caedmon Records TC 1172, recorded in 1963), is a straight narration of the tale. In the rest he changes his voice for each character, including an rendition of Nigel Bruce for Dr Watson.<ref name=BRR1>{{cite web | url=http://www.basilrathbone.net/recordings | title=Recordings made by Basil Rathbone | publisher=basilrathbone.net | accessdate=10 November 2019 }}</ref>\n\nRathbone also made many other recordings, of everything from a dramatised version of ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' to a recording of [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' (with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting) to a dramatised version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.<ref name=BRR1 />\n\nOn television he appeared in two musical versions of Dickens's ''A Christmas Carol'': one in 1954, in which he played [[Marley's Ghost]] opposite [[Fredric March]]'s Scrooge, and the original 1956 live action version of ''[[The Stingiest Man In Town]]'', in which he starred as a singing Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nIn the 1960s, he also toured with a one-man show titled (like his autobiography) ''In and Out of Character''. In this show, he recited poetry and Shakespeare as well as giving reminiscences from his life and career (e.g., the humorous, \"I could have killed Errol Flynn any time I wanted to!\"). As an encore, he recited \"221B\" a poem written by writer-critic [[Vincent Starrett]], one of the preeminent members of the [[Baker Street Irregulars]] whom Rathbone held in high regard.\n\nVincent Price and Rathbone appeared together, along with [[Boris Karloff]], in ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1963). The latter was the only film to feature the \"Big Four\" of [[American International Pictures]]' horror films: Price, Rathbone, Karloff and [[Peter Lorre]]. Rathbone also appeared with Price in the final segment of [[Roger Corman]]'s 1962 anthology film ''[[Tales of Terror]]'', a loose dramatisation of Poe's \"[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]\".\n\nIn 1965 Belmont Books issued the anthology ''Basil Rathbone Selects Strange Tales'', a collection of classic [[Horror novel|horror]] stories by Poe, Hawthorne, Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Dickens, Allston Collins, Le Fanu, and Wilkie Collins. The volume features a cover portrait of Rathbone; however, the back cover's legend \"Produced by Lyle Kenyon Engel\" indicates the anthology was probably not edited by Rathbone himself. Canadian editor and book packager Engel packaged shows and magazines for other horror film stars including [[Boris Karloff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/engel_lyle_kenyon|title=Authors : Engel, Lyle Kenyon : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com}}</ref>\n\nBasil Rathbone has three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one for films, at 6549 Hollywood Boulevard; one for radio, at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard; and one for television, at 6915 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Frank Robert Benson as Petruchio.jpg|thumb|A photograph of [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Robert Benson]] as Petruchio, from a 1911 performance of ''The Taming of the Shrew'']]\n\nRathbone married actress Ethel Marion Foreman (1887\u20131976) in 1914. They had one son, Rodion Rathbone (1915\u20131996), who had a brief Hollywood career under the name John Rodion. The couple [[divorce]]d in 1926. In 1924 he was involved in a brief relationship with [[Eva Le Gallienne]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}  In 1926, he married writer [[Ouida Berg\u00e8re]]; the couple adopted a daughter, Cynthia Rathbone (1939\u20131969).

This trend inspired a joke in ''[[The Ghost Breakers]]'' (1940), a film in which Rathbone does not appear: During a tremendous thunderstorm in New York City, [[Bob Hope]] observes that \"Basil Rathbone must be throwing a party\". Actress [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] described Rathbone as \"two profiles pasted together\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Basil Rathbone, ''In and Out of Character'' (New York: [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1962).</ref> As cited in the same autobiography, Mrs Campbell would later refer to him as \"a folded umbrella taking elocution lessons.\"{{cn|date=July 2019}} \n\nHe was a devout [[Episcopalian]] and a member of the Episcopal Actors Guild.<ref>http://littlechurch.org/#/who-we-are/episcopal-actors-guild</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRathbone died suddenly of a [[heart attack]] in [[New York City]] on 21 July 1967 at the age of 75.

He rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a [[Shakespearean]] stage actor and went on to appear in more than 70 films, primarily costume dramas, [[swashbuckler]]s and, occasionally, horror films.\n\nRathbone frequently portrayed suave villains or morally ambiguous characters, such as [[Edward Murdstone|Mr. Murdstone]] in ''[[David Copperfield (1935 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1935) and [[Sir Guy of Gisbourne]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938). His most famous role was that of [[Sherlock Holmes]] in [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|fourteen Hollywood films made between 1939 and 1946]] and in a radio series. His later career included roles on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], as well as self-ironic film and television work. He received a [[Tony Award]] in 1948 as [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play|Best Actor in a Play]]. He was also nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] and was honoured with three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}\nRathbone was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South African Republic|South Africa]],<ref name=\"baptism\">\"South Africa, Church of the Province of South Africa, Parish Registers, 1801-2004,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVSH-SB15 : 16 August 2019), Philip St John Basil Rathbone, 26 Mar 1894; citing Baptism, Transvaal, South Africa, p. , William Cullen Library, Wits University, Johannesburg.</ref> to British parents. His mother, Anna Barbara (n\u00e9e George), was a violinist, and his father, Edgar Philip Rathbone, was a mining engineer and scion of the [[Liverpool]] [[Rathbone family]]. He had two older half-brothers, Harold and Horace, as well as two younger siblings, Beatrice and John. Basil was the great-grandson of the noted Victorian philanthropist, [[William Rathbone V]], and thus a descendant of [[William Rathbone II]]. The Rathbones fled to Britain when Basil was three years old when his father was accused by the [[Boer]]s of being a spy after the [[Jameson Raid]]. He was a distant cousin of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Colonel]] [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present at the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], and was seriously wounded trying to stop [[John Wilkes Booth]].\n\nRathbone attended [[Repton School]] in [[Derbyshire]] from 1906 to 1910, where he excelled at sports and was given the nickname \"Ratters\" by schoolmates. Thereafter, he was briefly employed as an insurance clerk by the Liverpool and Globe Insurance Companies,<ref name=\"1911census\">\"England and Wales Census, 1911,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XWG3-B6W : 8 May 2019), Basil Philip St John Rathbone in household of Colin Forsyth Burn, Stoke Newington, London, England, United Kingdom; from \"1911 England and Wales census,\" database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing PRO RG 14, The National Archives of the UK, Kew, Surrey.</ref> to appease his father's wish for him to have a conventional career.<ref>[http://www.basilrathbone.net/biography/ basilrathbone.net] Retrieved 22 May 2018.</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1911, Rathbone made his first appearance on stage at the Theatre Royal, [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], as Hortensio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', with his cousin Sir Frank Benson's No. 2 Company, under the direction of [[Henry Herbert (actor)|Henry Herbert]]. In October 1912, he went to the United States with Benson's company, playing such parts as Paris in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Fenton in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', and Silvius in ''[[As You Like It]]''. Returning to Britain, he made his first appearance in London at the [[Savoy Theatre]] on 9 July 1914, as Finch in ''The Sin of David''. That December, he appeared at the [[Original Shaftesbury Theatre|Shaftesbury Theatre]] as the Dauphin in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. During 1915, he toured with Benson and appeared with him at London's Court Theatre in December as Lysander in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\n\n==Military service==\nDuring the [[First World War]], Rathbone was called up in 1915 via the [[Derby Scheme]] into the [[British Army]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] with the [[London Scottish Regiment]], joining a regiment that also included his future professional acting contemporaries [[Claude Rains]], [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[Ronald Colman]] at different points through the conflict. After [[basic training]] with the London Scots in early 1916 he received a commission as a [[lieutenant]] in the 2/10th Battalion of the King's Liverpool Regiment ([[Liverpool Scottish]]), where he served as an [[intelligence officer]] and attained the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].  Basil Rathbone was twice the British Army Fencing Champ, a skill that would serve him well in movies and allow him to even teach actors Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power the finer art of swordsmanship. Rathbone's younger brother John was killed in action on 4 June 1918.<ref>\"Famous 1914-18,\"  Richard Van Emden, 2010, p. 132</ref> In 2012 two letters Rathbone wrote to his family while serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were published. One reveals the anguish and anger he felt following the death of his brother, John:\n\n<blockquote> I want to tell him to mind his place. I think of his ridiculous belief that everything would always be well, his ever-hopeful smile, and I want to cuff him for a little fool. He had no business to let it happen and it maddens me that I shall never be able to tell him so, or change it or bring him back. I can\u2019t think of him without being consumed with anger at him for being dead and beyond anything I can do to him.\n:\u2014 26 July 1918<ref name=\"army\">{{cite web|url=http://www.basilrathbone.net/biography/ww1.htm |title=Basil Rathbone, Master of Stage and Screen: The Great War |publisher=Basilrathbone.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing his brother's death, Rathbone appears to have become unconcerned about the dangers of serving at the front. Author [[Richard Van Emden]] in ''Famous 1914\u201318'' speculates that his extreme bravery may have been a form of guilt or need for vengeance.<ref>''Famous 1914\u201318'',  Richard Van Emden, 2010, p. 134</ref> He persuaded his superiors to allow him to scout enemy positions during daylight rather than at night, as was the usual practice to minimise the chance of detection.<ref>{{Youtube|g2Fl8zYO9u8|title=A 1957 interview with Basil Rathbone talking about WWI}}</ref> Rathbone wore a special camouflage suit that resembled a tree with a wreath of freshly plucked foliage on his head with burnt cork applied to his hands and face.<ref>''In and Out of Character'', Basil Rathbone, 1962, p. 2</ref> As a result of these highly dangerous daylight reconnaissance missions in September 1918, he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for \"conspicuous daring and resource on patrol\".<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30997 |supp=y |date=5 November 1918 |page=13166}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDuring the Summer Festival of 1919, he appeared at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] with the New Shakespeare Company playing Romeo, Cassius, Ferdinand in ''[[The Tempest]]'' and Florizel in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''; in October he was at London's [[Queen's Theatre]] as the aide de camp in ''Napoleon'', and in February 1920 he was at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the title role in ''[[Peter Ibbetson (play)|Peter Ibbetson]]'' with huge success.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Rathbone appeared regularly in Shakespearean and other roles on the British stage. He began to travel and appeared at the [[Cort Theatre]], [[New York City|New York]], in October 1923 in a production of ''[[The Swan (ballet)|The Swan]]'' opposite [[Eva Le Gallienne]], which made him a star on Broadway. He toured in the United States in 1925, appearing in [[San Francisco]] in May and the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]], New York, in October. He was in the US again in 1927 and 1930 and again in 1931, when he appeared on stage with [[Ethel Barrymore]]. He continued his stage career in Britain, returning late in 1934 to the US, where he appeared with [[Katharine Cornell]] in several plays.\n\nRathbone was once arrested in 1926 along with every other member of the cast of ''[[The Captive (play)|The Captive]]'', a play in which his character's wife left him for another woman. Though the charges were eventually dropped, Rathbone was very angry about the censorship because he believed that [[homosexuality]] needed to be brought into the open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/wiki/New_York_Times:_Reaction_to_%22The_Captive%22,_1926-1927 |title=New York Times: Reaction to 'The Captive', 1926-1927 - OutHistory |work=outhistory.org |year=2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basilrathbone.net/biography/ |title=Basil Rathbone, Master of Stage and Screen: Biography |publisher=Basilrathbone.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Romeo and Juliet lobby card 2.jpg|thumb|right|With [[John Barrymore]] and [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] in ''Romeo and Juliet'', 1936]]\nHe commenced his film career in 1921 in silent movies and appeared in 1923's \"School for Scandal\", later appearing in ''[[The Masked Bride]]'', appeared in a few [[silent film]]s, and played the detective [[Philo Vance]] in the 1930 film ''[[The Bishop Murder Case (film)|The Bishop Murder Case]]'', based on the best selling novel. In the film there is a coincidental reference to Sherlock Holmes. Like [[George Sanders]] and [[Vincent Price]] after him, Rathbone made a name for himself in the 1930s by playing suave villains in costume dramas and swashbucklers, including ''[[Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger|David Copperfield]]'' (1935) as the abusive stepfather Mr. Murdstone; ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935) as her distant husband, Karenin; ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) as [[Pontius Pilate]]; ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935); ''[[A Tale of Two Cities (1935 film)|A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1935), as the Marquis St. Evremonde; ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (movie)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938) playing his best-remembered villain, Sir [[Guy of Gisbourne]]; ''[[The Adventures of Marco Polo]]'' (1938); and ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) as Captain Esteban Pasquale. He also appeared in several early horror films: ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1939), as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), portraying the dedicated surgeon [[Wolf Frankenstein|Baron Wolf von Frankenstein]], son of [[Frankenstein's monster|the monster]]'s creator, and, in 1949, was also the narrator for the segment \"The Wind in the Willows\" in the Disney animated feature, ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''.\n\nHe was admired for his athletic cinema swordsmanship (he listed [[fencing]] among his favourite recreations). He fought and lost to [[Errol Flynn]] in a duel on the beach in ''Captain Blood'' and in an elaborate fight sequence in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''. He was also involved in noteworthy sword fights in ''Tower of London'', ''The Mark of Zorro'', and ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956). Despite his real life skill, Rathbone won only twice on screen, against [[John Barrymore]] in ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1936) and against [[Eugene Pallette]] in ''The Mark of Zorro'' (1940). Rathbone earned [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] for his performances as Tybalt in ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1936) and as King [[Louis XI]] in ''[[If I Were King]]'' (1938), a truly remarkable, comedic performance as the wily king. In ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'' (1938), he played one of his few heroic roles in the 1930s, as a [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) squadron commander brought to the brink of a [[nervous breakdown]] by the strain and guilt of sending his battle-weary pilots off to near-certain death in the skies of 1915 France. Errol Flynn, Rathbone's perennial foe, starred in the film as his successor when Rathbone's character was promoted.\n\nAccording to Hollywood legend, Rathbone was [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s first choice to play [[Rhett Butler]] in the film version of her novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. The reliability of this story may be suspect, however, as on another occasion Mitchell chose [[Groucho Marx]] for the role, apparently in jest. Rathbone actively campaigned for the role, however, but to no avail.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nDespite his film success, Rathbone always insisted that he wished to be remembered for his stage career. He said that his favourite role was that of Romeo.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===The Sherlock Holmes films===\n[[File:Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes.jpeg|thumb|Basil Rathbone as [[Sherlock Holmes]]]]\n{{main article|Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)}}\nRathbone is most widely recognised for his many portrayals of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. In a radio interview Rathbone recalled that [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] producer and director [[Gene Markey]], lunching with producer-director-actor [[Gregory Ratoff]] and 20th Century-Fox mogul [[Daryl Zanuck]] at Lucey's Restaurant in [[Hollywood]], proposed a film version of [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''. When asked who could possibly play Holmes, Markey incredulously replied, \"''Who?!'' Basil Rathbone!\" The film was so successful that Fox produced a sequel which appeared later in 1939. Interest in Holmes cooled at Fox, but [[Universal Pictures]] picked up the character, and twelve feature films were made between 1941 and 1944 for release until 1947, all of which co-starred [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Dr. Watson]].\n\nThe first two films, ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (both produced by Fox in 1939), were set in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] of the original stories. The later instalments, produced by Universal, beginning with ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942), were set in contemporary times. The first three had [[World War II]]-related plots.\n\nConcurrent with the films, Rathbone and Bruce reprised their film roles in a radio series, ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', which began in October 1939. Rathbone appeared in the radio series as long as the film series was active, but after the films lapsed in 1946, Rathbone ceded his radio part to [[Tom Conway]]. Conway and Bruce carried on with the series for two seasons, until both dropped out in July 1947.\n\nThe many Holmes sequels [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] Rathbone, and he was unable to shake himself completely free from the shadow of the Great Detective despite appearing in other film roles. Resenting the typecasting, Rathbone refused to renew his contract at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and returned to Broadway. In later years, however, Rathbone willingly made the Holmes association, as in a TV sketch with [[Milton Berle]] in the early 1950s, in which he donned the [[deerstalker]] cap and [[Inverness cape]]. In the 1960s, dressed as Holmes, he appeared in a series of TV commercials for Getz Exterminators (\"Getz gets 'em, since 1888!'\").\n\nRathbone also brought Holmes to the stage in a play written by his wife Ouida. [[Thomas Gomez]], who had appeared as a [[Nazi]] ringleader in ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'', played the villainous [[Professor Moriarty]]. Nigel Bruce was slated to portray Dr Watson once more but became too ill and the part was played by character actor [[Jack Raine]]. Bruce's absence depressed Rathbone, particularly after Bruce died on 8 October 1953, while the play was in rehearsals. The play ran for only three performances.\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1950s, Rathbone appeared in two spoofs of his earlier swashbuckling villains: ''[[Casanova's Big Night]]'' (1954) opposite [[Bob Hope]] and ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956) with [[Danny Kaye]]. He appeared frequently on TV game shows and continued to appear in major films, including the [[Humphrey Bogart]] comedy ''[[We're No Angels (1955 film)|We're No Angels]]'' (1955) and [[John Ford]]'s political drama ''[[The Last Hurrah (1958 film)|The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958).\n\nRathbone also appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] numerous times. In 1948, he won a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor for his performance as the unyielding Dr. Austin Sloper in the original production of ''The Heiress'', which featured [[Wendy Hiller]] as his timid, spinster daughter. He also received accolades for his performance in [[Archibald Macleish]]'s ''[[J.B. (play)|J.B.]]'', a modernisation of the Biblical trials of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]].\n\nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, he continued to appear in several dignified anthology programmes on television. To support his second wife's lavish tastes, he appeared as a panelist on the television game show ''[[The Name's the Same]]'' (in 1954), and he also took roles in cheap film thrillers of far lesser quality, such as ''[[The Black Sleep]]'' (1956), ''[[Queen of Blood]]'' (1966), ''[[The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini]]'' (1966, wherein the character ' Eric Von Zipper' played by [[Harvey Lembeck]] jokes, \"That guy looks like Sherlock Holmes\"), ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967, also featuring [[Lon Chaney Jr]] and [[John Carradine]]), and his last film, a low budget, [[Mexico|Mexican]] horror film called ''Autopsy of a Ghost'' (1968).\n\nHe is also known for his [[spoken word]] recordings, including his interpretation of [[Clement C. Moore]]'s \"[[The Night Before Christmas]]\". Rathbone's readings of the stories and poems of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] are collected together with readings by [[Vincent Price]] in [[Caedmon Audio]]'s ''The Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection'' on CD. \n\nIn four Caedmon albums Rathbone revisited his characterization of Sherlock Holmes. The first, \"The Speckled Band\" (Caedmon Records TC 1172, recorded in 1963), is a straight narration of the tale. In the rest he changes his voice for each character, including an rendition of Nigel Bruce for Dr Watson.<ref name=BRR1>{{cite web | url=http://www.basilrathbone.net/recordings | title=Recordings made by Basil Rathbone | publisher=basilrathbone.net | accessdate=10 November 2019 }}</ref>\n\nRathbone also made many other recordings, of everything from a dramatised version of ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' to a recording of [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' (with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting) to a dramatised version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.<ref name=BRR1 />\n\nOn television he appeared in two musical versions of Dickens's ''A Christmas Carol'': one in 1954, in which he played [[Marley's Ghost]] opposite [[Fredric March]]'s Scrooge, and the original 1956 live action version of ''[[The Stingiest Man In Town]]'', in which he starred as a singing Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nIn the 1960s, he also toured with a one-man show titled (like his autobiography) ''In and Out of Character''. In this show, he recited poetry and Shakespeare as well as giving reminiscences from his life and career (e.g., the humorous, \"I could have killed Errol Flynn any time I wanted to!\"). As an encore, he recited \"221B\" a poem written by writer-critic [[Vincent Starrett]], one of the preeminent members of the [[Baker Street Irregulars]] whom Rathbone held in high regard.\n\nVincent Price and Rathbone appeared together, along with [[Boris Karloff]], in ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1963). The latter was the only film to feature the \"Big Four\" of [[American International Pictures]]' horror films: Price, Rathbone, Karloff and [[Peter Lorre]]. Rathbone also appeared with Price in the final segment of [[Roger Corman]]'s 1962 anthology film ''[[Tales of Terror]]'', a loose dramatisation of Poe's \"[[The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar]]\".\n\nIn 1965 Belmont Books issued the anthology ''Basil Rathbone Selects Strange Tales'', a collection of classic [[Horror novel|horror]] stories by Poe, Hawthorne, Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Dickens, Allston Collins, Le Fanu, and Wilkie Collins. The volume features a cover portrait of Rathbone; however, the back cover's legend \"Produced by Lyle Kenyon Engel\" indicates the anthology was probably not edited by Rathbone himself. Canadian editor and book packager Engel packaged shows and magazines for other horror film stars including [[Boris Karloff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/engel_lyle_kenyon|title=Authors : Engel, Lyle Kenyon : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com}}</ref>\n\nBasil Rathbone has three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one for films, at 6549 Hollywood Boulevard; one for radio, at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard; and one for television, at 6915 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Frank Robert Benson as Petruchio.jpg|thumb|A photograph of [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Robert Benson]] as Petruchio, from a 1911 performance of ''The Taming of the Shrew'']]\n\nRathbone married actress Ethel Marion Foreman (1887\u20131976) in 1914. They had one son, Rodion Rathbone (1915\u20131996), who had a brief Hollywood career under the name John Rodion. The couple [[divorce]]d in 1926.

The term ''thymesia'' is derived from the Greek word ''thymesis'', meaning \"memory\" and the Greek meaning of \"hyper\" means \"over\".<ref name=parker>Parker, E. S.; Cahill, L.; McGaugh, J. L. (2006). ''Psychology Press''. \"[http://zfhindbrain.com/files/75583289.pdf A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering]\", 12, 35\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe capabilities of the affected individuals are not limited to recalling specific events from their personal experience. Hyperthymesia has both enhanced autobiographical and [[episodic memory]]<ref name=parker/> There is an important characteristic of hyperthymesia: People with the syndrome have an unusual form of eidetic memory to remember as well as recall any specific personal events or trivial details, including a date, the weather, what people wore on that day, from their past, almost in an organized manner.\n\nUnlike other people with advanced memory abilities, such as [[savant syndrome]] (who tend to use [[calendrical calculation]]), individuals with hyperthymestic syndrome rely heavily on their personal \"mental calendar\",<ref name=parker/> which is an automatic and obsessive process. Moreover, individuals with hyperthymesia do not focus on practiced [[mnemonic]] strategies.<ref name=parker/> For example, \"AJ\", who has the first documented case of hyperthymesia, has difficulty consciously applying her memory strategies to help her memorize new knowledge, making her rote memorization abilities below average. Importantly, having superior autobiographical memory does not translate to broadly superior memory, in fact across tests like a digit span, visual reproduction, and word-pair memorization, those with hyperthymesia have no statistically significant difference from a control group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LePort|first=Aurora K.R.|last2=Stark|first2=Shauna M.|last3=McGaugh|first3=James L.|last4=Stark|first4=Craig E.L.|date=February 2017|title=A Cognitive Assessment of Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488704/|journal=Memory (Hove, England)|volume=25|issue=2|pages=276\u2013288|doi=10.1080/09658211.2016.1160126|issn=0965-8211|pmc=5488704|pmid=26982996}}</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nBecause it is a recently discovered memory capability, neuroscientific explanations of hyperthymesia are scarce. McGaugh, who coined the term, provides mostly speculation in \"A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering\". He suggests that \"AJ\"'s superior autobiographical memory is largely the result of specific impairments rather than enhancements. Her sensitivity to cues that trigger her memories suggest that \"AJ\" has trouble inhibiting episodic-retrieval mode, which is the neurocognitive state required for present stimuli to be interpreted as memory cues. Because she is unable to \"turn off\" her retrieval mode, the smallest associations may bring on detailed recollections of \"AJ\"'s past.<ref name=parker/>\n\n[[Memory inhibition|Inhibition]] in itself is a type of executive functioning, thought to be associated with the right inferior [[frontal cortex]].<ref name=parker/> Although \"AJ\" is not autistic, McGaugh and colleagues note that she shares some of the executive-functioning deficits that occur with autism. These deficits, along with anomalous lateralization and \"AJ\"'s obsessive\u2013compulsive tendencies, point to a neurodevelopmental frontostriatal disorder common in autism, OCD, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The frontostriatal system is made up of the dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], lateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[cingulate]], supplementary motor area, and associated [[basal ganglia]] structures.<ref name=parker/>\n\n=== Cases ===\n{{As of|April 2016}}, there are an estimated 60 confirmed cases of hyperthymesia worldwide. Cases of hyperthymesia differ from related cases of savant memory in that savants have an extraordinary memory for specific hobbies, and events of a narrow basis, whereas cases of confirmed hyperthymesia show surprisingly detailed memory for specific and general events.\n\nOne subject, who, given any date in history, can recall what the weather was like on said date, personal details of their life at the time, and other news events that occurred at that time. Details of what the subject recalls may be significant to them in some way, but they may not be. Personal meaning does not seem to affect the subject's memory&nbsp;\u2013 they simply recall everything.<ref name=abc>(2006). [https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1738881&page=1 Woman with perfect memory baffles scientists]. ABC News, Retrieved 19 March 2009, from http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=1738881&page=1</ref> In another confirmed case, the subject, when shown a photograph from his past, can recall the date it was taken, where it was taken, what they had done that day, and even more detailed information such as the temperature on said day.<ref name=martin>Martin, S (2008). Man's rare ability may unlock secret of memory. CNN, Retrieved 19 March 2009, from http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/05/07/miraculous.memory/index.html</ref>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAJ describes her memory as a \"running movie that never stops\".<ref name=parker/>  She views the world in \"split screen\", with the past constantly playing at the same time as the present.  She explains that although \"most have called it a gift\", she calls it a \"burden\".  AJ's superior memory does not seem to be due to a desire to apply memorizing techniques; her [[memorization]] of autobiographical information is [[unconscious mind|non-conscious]].  It is possible that AJ's memory could stem from the traumatic experience of having her family move when she was 8, at which point she began to \"organize her memories\" and think about the life she had left behind a great deal.\n\n== Eidetic memory ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Eidetic memory]]\u2014total recall memory\u2014refers to the ability of an individual who can accurately recall a large number of images, sounds and objects in a seemingly unlimited volume. Eidetic has a meaning of \"related extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images\" in Greek.<ref name=abc/> The term eidetic memory can become more clinical when the memory experts use the picture elicitation method to detect the ability.<ref name=martin/> In the picture elicitation method, children are asked to study an image for approximately twenty to thirty minutes, and then the researchers remove the picture, it has been found that children with such ability are able to recall the image with perfect accuracy after the picture has been removed. It has been suggested that children with eidetic memory can maintain the image in their memory as vividly as if it were still there.<ref name=abc/>\n\nThere are reports of different forms of eidetic memory as well as new case studies that suggest a difference between photographic and eidetic memory, although not enough scientific data exist currently from the medical community.{{example needed|date=December 2019}} Public documents from the APA, Yale, and Harvard suggest otherwise and that more studies are being done in order to properly stimulate the differences; all current noted forms of memory are open to the public but not meant to discriminate against the hypothesis of new types. Older studies have claimed to have observed a variety of drawbacks among those who have an apparent eidetic memory. Eidetic imagery can be so vivid as to mimic actual perception of stimuli, which can be much like a [[hallucination]].<ref name=gray>{{cite journal|last1 = Gray|first1 = C.

The experiment was intended to investigate chess grandmasters' ability to memorize positions of chess pieces on a chessboard.<ref name=groot>{{cite book|last1 = De Groot|first1 = A.|authorlink1 = Adriaan de Groot|last2 = Gobet|first2 = F.|authorlink2 = Fernand Gobet|last3 = Jongman|first3 = R. W.|date = 1996|title = Perception and memory in chess studies in the heuristics of the professional eye|location = Assen|publisher = Van Gorcum|isbn = 9789023229490}}</ref> When those chess experts were provided with arrangements that were inconsistent with a real chess game, their performance was about the same as non-experts. These results indicate that the eidetic ability of those chess grandmasters were not innate, but a learned strategy with certain types of information.<ref name=groot/> Wilding and Valentine searched for people claiming to have an eidetic or otherwise superior memory via public media. Out of the 31&nbsp;people who called in, only three actually had a significantly above-average but not eidetic memory.<ref name=vild>{{cite book|last1 = Wilding|first1 = J. M.|last2 = Valentine|first2 = E. R.|date = 1997|title = Superior memory|location = Hove|publisher = Psychology Press|isbn = 9780863774560}}</ref>\n\nFurther cause for skepticism is given by a non-scientific event: The [[World Memory Championships]]. Held since 1991, this is an annual competition in different memory disciplines and is nearly totally based on visual tasks&nbsp;\u2013 nine out of ten events are displayed visually, the tenth event is presented by audio. Since the champions can win interesting prizes, it should attract people who can beat those tests easily by reproducing visual images of the presented material during the recall. But indeed not a single memory champion has ever been reported to have an eidetic memory. Instead without a single exception all winners consider themselves mnemonists (see below) and rely on using [[mnemonic]] strategies, mostly the [[method of loci]].\n\n=== Cases ===\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John von Neumann]] possessed near-total recall]]\n[[List of people claimed to possess an eidetic memory|Cases of eidetic memory]] have been reported for generations,{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} with a 1970 study on a woman being called the most convincing documentation yet. Her memory was extraordinary in that she could see an image once and retain it in memory for years to come. The classic study of the subject's memory documents her writing out poetry in a foreign language, of which she had no prior knowledge, years after seeing the original text. This suggests that her memory retained the image of the foreign words vividly enough to recall years later.

It is unclear what this illness was exactly but, symptoms included high fever, weight loss, delirium, and possibly even seizures. For this, Magnani was placed into a sanatorium. Here he had vivid dreams of his hometown, not of his family or friends or even of events, but of the town itself. According to Magnani, the dreams were in a detail beyond anything he could consciously imagine.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=An Anthropologist On Mars|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Public Random House, LLC|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-75697-2|location=New York|pages=153\u2013187}}</ref>\n\nAfter getting released from the hospital, Franco Magnani considered, but ultimately rejected medical possibilities that were suggested. These possibilities included some sort of freudian splitting of the ego which could have resulted in hypermnesia hysteria. While Magnani rejected these notions, he never allowed them to be properly explored.<ref name=\":2\" /> Once relocating to San Francisco, Magnani picked up painting, which he had no formal training in. His first painting was of his childhood home in Pontito. Magnani painted the house in remarkable accuracy, so much so that he himself was amazed. This was especially surprising considering the fact that at this point, Magnani had not been to Pontito in over 25 years. Over time, he grew an obsession to painting the town in which he grew up in, famed psychologist Oliver Sacks noted in 1987, Magnini seemed \"possessed.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThat same year, photographer Susan Schwartzenberg went to Pontito to photograph the scenes of many of Magnani's paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was done as part of a study to document the astonishing accuracy of the artists work.

This garnered lots of attention by researchers such as Bob Miller who suggested that this work could reveal the accuracy, distortions, and inventions of Magnani's memory. These photographs showed something interesting about Magnani's work that was not previously evident.

Mnemonic devices are usually verbal, such as a special phrase, word or a short poem that individuals are familiar with.\n\nEach individual has two types of memory, termed \"natural memory\" and \"artificial memory\".<ref name=parker/> Mnemonic strategy is said to help develop artificial memory through learning and practicing [[Art of memory|memory techniques]].<ref name=parker/>\n\nCommon mnemonics for memorizing lists of words is through the use of acronym, which is the abbreviation that consists of the initial letter in a phrase or word. For example, HOMES is often used to help remember the names of the [[Great Lakes]] of North America. Most techniques for memorizing numbers involve turning the numbers into visual images that are then placed along points of an imaginary [[Method of loci|memory journey]]. The mind has difficulty remembering abstract concepts like numbers, but can easily remember visual images. The imaginary memory journey orders the images in the correct sequence. Two common techniques for converting numbers and playing cards into visual images are the [[Mnemonic major system]] and the [[Mnemonic dominic system]].\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nNo structural differences have been found in the brains of accomplished memorists, who have achieved superior memory with the practiced use of mnemonic devices. One study that sought to locate the neural differences between these and people with typical memory abilities using [[fMRI]], was unable to find any differences. For memorists, the right [[cingulate cortex]], [[ventral fusiform cortex]], and left posterior [[inferior frontal sulcus]] were more active for [[Piphilology|digit span memorization]] (a feat memorists are often very good at).<ref name=maguire>Maguire, E.

This ability was discovered during a work meeting where Shereshvskii was scolded for not taking notes until he was able to perfectly recite the conversation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-mystery-of-s-the-man-with-an-impossible-memory|title=The Mystery of S., the Man with an Impossible Memory|last=Johnson|first=Reed|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> \"S\" had [[synaesthesia]], a condition in which the stimulation of one sense prompts a reaction in another sense. [[Alexander Luria]] reported that \"S\" had the unique ability to recall almost everything he heard or saw though did not provide detailed evidence or clearly distinguish between \"natural\" abilities and his use of the [[method of loci]]. There are several anecdotal reports of \"S\" recalling a speech word for word without taking notes along with his peers.\n\nAnother interesting case of recall is of the subject S.F., who began testing with an average intelligence and average memory capabilities. With the use of mnemonic strategies (practice sessions in the laboratory) he was able to increase his digit span from 7 to 79.<ref name=ericson>Ericsson, A, Chase, W, & Faloon, S Acquisition of a memory skill.

Qualifying times). Using mnemonics for memory recall may also have played a part in [[Akira Haraguchi]]'s world record citation of mathematical pi. Cases such as these suggest that superior memory can be achieved with the proper mnemonic techniques.\n\nAlso all competitors of the annual [[World Memory Championships]] name mnemonic strategies the source for their performances (including performances like memorizing a list of more than 2000 digits in an hour, 280 words in 15 minutes or the order of a deck of cards in under 25 seconds).\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n[[Solomon Shereshevskii]], or 'S', was viewed by peers as disorganized and unintelligent.  His extreme case of synesthesia, causing highly detailed and recallable memory traces, made understanding abstract concepts not based on sensory and perceptual qualities very difficult for him.<ref name=luria>Luria, A.R.

They are also associated with typical and atypical functioning in memory.<ref name=gaigg>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.011|pmid = 18164320|year = 2008|last1 = Gaigg|first1 = S.|last2 = Gardiner|first2 = J.|last3 = Bowler|first3 = D.|title = Free recall in autism spectrum disorder: the role of relational and item-specific encoding|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 983\u2013992|pmc = 2265793|journal = Neuropsychologia}}</ref>  Structural abnormalities have been found to affect the [[hippocampus]], with the [[perirhinal]], [[entorhinal]], and [[parahippocampus]] less affected (these are areas in the [[medial temporal lobe]] outside of the hippocampus). The hippocampus is thought to be involved in domain-general relational processes, with surrounding areas mediating more domain and item-specific and contextual processing. This is consistent with observed memory effects of ASD which shows superior low-level and item-specific processing, at a cost of having impairments in higher level relational processes.<ref name=gaigg/>\n\nOne example found in the literature is J.S., with high functioning autism. J.S. has no [[episodic memory]] (which is highly associative or relational in nature) and must rely on memorizing facts.

Wawro is known for his paintings of landscapes and seascapes, all done in elaborate detail.<ref name=treffert/> What is interesting about Wawro's art is that he paints from seeing a scene only once and does not use a model. His memory for the scene is so elaborate that he can also report where he drew the picture and when. Similarities across cases indicate that savant memory may be similar to eidetic memory.<ref name=treffert/>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\nIndividuals with [[autism]] are more likely to have savant skills so, for them, the most obvious drawback could be the drawbacks they link to autism itself.  Most cases of [[calendrical calculation]] involve individuals with IQs that are below average.  Autism spectrum disorders contain criteria for diagnosis based on difficulties with social behaviour and communicating with others, amongst other debilitating criteria.<ref name=gaigg/> Researchers have proposed two hypotheses to explain how autistic individuals may develop advanced skills;<ref name=oconnor>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(99)00028-8 | last = O'Connor | first = N |author2=Cowan R |author3=Samella K | year = 2000 | title = Calendrical Calculation and Intelligence | journal = Intelligence | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 31\u201348 }}</ref> the first is the obsession with constricted areas of interest (a common symptom of autism) and [[central coherence]].  Central coherence is a style of [[cognitive processing]] indicative of an autistic individual, which involves a focus on local features during processing.  Researchers feel that this style of processing may aid in the increase of savant skills, but this style also sacrifices global processing in the process.\n\n== Emotional memory ==\n{{Main|Flashbulb memory}}\nAn '''emotional''' or '''flashbulb''' memory refers to the memory of a personal significant event with distinctly vivid and long-lasting detailed information. These events are usually shocking and with photographic quality. Brown and Kulik, who coined the term, found that many highly emotional memories can be recalled with very accurate details, even when there is a delay after the event.<ref name=brown>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = R. | last2 = Kulik | first2 = J. | year = 1977 | title = Flashbulb memories | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 73\u201399 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(77)90018-X }}</ref>\n\nA Flashbulb memory is said to be less accurate and less permanent than [[photographic memory|photographic memories]], but its [[forgetting curve]] is less affected by time in comparing to other types of memories.<ref name=markham>Markham, A.

Retrieved 2 April 2009, from http://www.uic.edu/classes/comm/comm200am/teamprojects/MemoryTechnologies/Flashbulb_Memory.htm</ref> One important aspect of flashbulb memory is that it involves emotional arousal when the event is being remembered. Therefore, this kind of memory does not have to be accurate, and the accuracy usually decreases during the first 3 months and goes up again at about 12 months.<ref name=markham/> An example of the errors and malleability of flashbulb memories is found in the El Al Flight 1862 crash. Despite widespread photos and videos of the effects of the crash, there is no video evidence of the crash itself. Despite this, when study participants were asked if they witnessed a video of the crash, over 60 percent claimed to have seen the video on television. Some participants were even willing to offer more information such as the angle of the crash or whether the plane was on fire, despite the lack of video.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ost|first=James|last2=Hogbin|first2=Ian|last3=Granhag|first3=P\u00e4r-Anders|date=2006-06-01|title=Altering false reports via confederate influence|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15534510500480273|journal=Social Influence|volume=1|issue=2|pages=105\u2013116|doi=10.1080/15534510500480273|issn=1553-4510}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by Sharot et al.

Retrieved April 2, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nThe focus of the research on [[emotional memory]] is on the role of the [[amygdala]].  In one study participants watched either an emotionally arousing film or a neutral film. Results of a [[PET scan]] showed correlation between right [[Archistriatum|Amygdaloid Complex]] (AC) activity and recall for emotional elements of the film when participants were asked to remember the film a few weeks later.<ref name=cahill/> Although this study demonstrates the involvement of the AC, it offers no insight as to the specific role of the amygdala. [[James McGaugh|McGaugh]] and colleagues posit that although electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation directly to the amygdala can enhance or decrease memory, the amygdala is not the main site for any [[long-term memory]] storage. Rather, the amygdala acts as a modulator for storage processes occurring in other areas of the brain. Long-term memories are not created automatically, they must be consolidated over time. Research indicates that it is this consolidation process in which the AC plays an assisting role (there is no evidence that it aids in retrieval). Specifically, McGaugh suggests that emotional arousal activates the amygdala, which regulates the strength of a memory, lending to enhanced memory for emotionally charged events.<ref name=roozendaal>McGaugh, J. L., Cahill, L., & Roozendaal, B. (1996). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage: interaction with other brain systems, 93(24), 13508-13514.</ref>\n\nThe amygdala itself is a collection of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] with distinct functions, the basolateral AC the most involved with memory.<ref name=cahill/> The BL projects into the hippocampus and [[entorhinal cortex]] and stimulation of the AC functioning activates both of these areas.<ref name=cahill/> Further indication that the amygdala works to modulate other areas of the brain is supported by the fact that AC stimulation is mediated by the [[stria terminalis]] (ST), a major AC pathway. Lesions of the ST block AC stimulation effects.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nAC and ST lesions also appear to block [[hormonal]] and [[adrenaline]] enhancements. [[Stress hormones]] produced by emotional situations influence memory storage. Memory can also be selectively enhanced by post-training administration of drugs and hormones. It is also well known that emotional situations produce an \"[[Fight-or-flight response|adrenaline rush]]\". This adrenaline, as well as [[cortisol]] (adrenocortical hormone) serve to influence an organism's response to stress, but also may aid future responding by enhancing declarative memory of them.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nNegative emotional experiences may be remembered better than positive experiences. [[Ben Goddard|Goddard]] found that retention was disrupted with electrical stimulation of AC after aversive learning, but not with appetitively motivated learning.\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAn experience must be very arousing to an individual for it to be consolidated as an [[emotional memory]], and this arousal can be negative, thus causing a negative memory to be strongly retained.<ref name=cahill>{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = L. | last2 = McGaugh | first2 = J.L. | year = 1998 | title = Mechanisms of emotional arousal and lasting declarative memory | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b27/f7ccbc68e6bf9bc1538f7ed8d1ca9d8e563a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 21 | issue = 7| pages = 294\u2013299 | doi = 10.1016/s0166-2236(97)01214-9 }}</ref>  Having a long-lasting extremely vivid and detailed memory for negative events can cause a great deal of [[anxiety]], as seen in [[post-traumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorders]].

Hyperthymesia has both enhanced autobiographical and [[episodic memory]]<ref name=parker/> There is an important characteristic of hyperthymesia: People with the syndrome have an unusual form of eidetic memory to remember as well as recall any specific personal events or trivial details, including a date, the weather, what people wore on that day, from their past, almost in an organized manner.\n\nUnlike other people with advanced memory abilities, such as [[savant syndrome]] (who tend to use [[calendrical calculation]]), individuals with hyperthymestic syndrome rely heavily on their personal \"mental calendar\",<ref name=parker/> which is an automatic and obsessive process. Moreover, individuals with hyperthymesia do not focus on practiced [[mnemonic]] strategies.<ref name=parker/> For example, \"AJ\", who has the first documented case of hyperthymesia, has difficulty consciously applying her memory strategies to help her memorize new knowledge, making her rote memorization abilities below average. Importantly, having superior autobiographical memory does not translate to broadly superior memory, in fact across tests like a digit span, visual reproduction, and word-pair memorization, those with hyperthymesia have no statistically significant difference from a control group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LePort|first=Aurora K.R.|last2=Stark|first2=Shauna M.|last3=McGaugh|first3=James L.|last4=Stark|first4=Craig E.L.|date=2017-2|title=A Cognitive Assessment of Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488704/|journal=Memory (Hove, England)|volume=25|issue=2|pages=276\u2013288|doi=10.1080/09658211.2016.1160126|issn=0965-8211|pmc=5488704|pmid=26982996}}</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nBecause it is a recently discovered memory capability, neuroscientific explanations of hyperthymesia are scarce. McGaugh, who coined the term, provides mostly speculation in \"A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering\". He suggests that \"AJ\"'s superior autobiographical memory is largely the result of specific impairments rather than enhancements. Her sensitivity to cues that trigger her memories suggest that \"AJ\" has trouble inhibiting episodic-retrieval mode, which is the neurocognitive state required for present stimuli to be interpreted as memory cues. Because she is unable to \"turn off\" her retrieval mode, the smallest associations may bring on detailed recollections of \"AJ\"'s past.<ref name=parker/>\n\n[[Memory inhibition|Inhibition]] in itself is a type of executive functioning, thought to be associated with the right inferior [[frontal cortex]].<ref name=parker/> Although \"AJ\" is not autistic, McGaugh and colleagues note that she shares some of the executive-functioning deficits that occur with autism. These deficits, along with anomalous lateralization and \"AJ\"'s obsessive\u2013compulsive tendencies, point to a neurodevelopmental frontostriatal disorder common in autism, OCD, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The frontostriatal system is made up of the dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], lateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[cingulate]], supplementary motor area, and associated [[basal ganglia]] structures.<ref name=parker/>\n\n=== Cases ===\n{{As of|April 2016}}, there are an estimated 60 confirmed cases of hyperthymesia worldwide. Cases of hyperthymesia differ from related cases of savant memory in that savants have an extraordinary memory for specific hobbies, and events of a narrow basis, whereas cases of confirmed hyperthymesia show surprisingly detailed memory for specific and general events.\n\nOne subject, who, given any date in history, can recall what the weather was like on said date, personal details of their life at the time, and other news events that occurred at that time. Details of what the subject recalls may be significant to them in some way, but they may not be. Personal meaning does not seem to affect the subject's memory&nbsp;\u2013 they simply recall everything.<ref name=abc>(2006).

Man's rare ability may unlock secret of memory. CNN, Retrieved 19 March 2009, from http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/05/07/miraculous.memory/index.html</ref>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAJ describes her memory as a \"running movie that never stops\".<ref name=parker/>  She views the world in \"split screen\", with the past constantly playing at the same time as the present.  She explains that although \"most have called it a gift\", she calls it a \"burden\".  AJ's superior memory does not seem to be due to a desire to apply memorizing techniques; her [[memorization]] of autobiographical information is [[unconscious mind|non-conscious]].  It is possible that AJ's memory could stem from the traumatic experience of having her family move when she was 8, at which point she began to \"organize her memories\" and think about the life she had left behind a great deal.\n\n== Eidetic memory ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Eidetic memory]]\u2014total recall memory\u2014refers to the ability of an individual who can accurately recall a large number of images, sounds and objects in a seemingly unlimited volume. Eidetic has a meaning of \"related extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images\" in Greek.<ref name=abc/> The term eidetic memory can become more clinical when the memory experts use the picture elicitation method to detect the ability.<ref name=martin/> In the picture elicitation method, children are asked to study an image for approximately twenty to thirty minutes, and then the researchers remove the picture, it has been found that children with such ability are able to recall the image with perfect accuracy after the picture has been removed. It has been suggested that children with eidetic memory can maintain the image in their memory as vividly as if it were still there.<ref name=abc/>\n\nThere are reports of different forms of eidetic memory as well as new case studies that suggest a difference between photographic and eidetic memory, although not enough scientific data exist currently from the medical community.{{example needed|date=December 2019}} Public documents from the APA, Yale, and Harvard suggest otherwise and that more studies are being done in order to properly stimulate the differences; all current noted forms of memory are open to the public but not meant to discriminate against the hypothesis of new types. Older studies have claimed to have observed a variety of drawbacks among those who have an apparent eidetic memory.

Held since 1991, this is an annual competition in different memory disciplines and is nearly totally based on visual tasks&nbsp;\u2013 nine out of ten events are displayed visually, the tenth event is presented by audio. Since the champions can win interesting prizes, it should attract people who can beat those tests easily by reproducing visual images of the presented material during the recall. But indeed not a single memory champion has ever been reported to have an eidetic memory. Instead without a single exception all winners consider themselves mnemonists (see below) and rely on using [[mnemonic]] strategies, mostly the [[method of loci]].\n\n=== Cases ===\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John von Neumann]] possessed near-total recall]]\n[[List of people claimed to possess an eidetic memory|Cases of eidetic memory]] have been reported for generations,{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} with a 1970 study on a woman being called the most convincing documentation yet. Her memory was extraordinary in that she could see an image once and retain it in memory for years to come. The classic study of the subject's memory documents her writing out poetry in a foreign language, of which she had no prior knowledge, years after seeing the original text. This suggests that her memory retained the image of the foreign words vividly enough to recall years later.

It is unclear what this illness was exactly but, symptoms included high fever, weight loss, delirium, and possibly even seizures. For this, Magnani was placed into a sanatorium. Here he had vivid dreams of his hometown, not of his family or friends or even of events, but of the town itself. According to Magnani, the dreams were in a detail beyond anything he could consciously imagine.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=An Anthropologist On Mars|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Public Random House, LLC|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-75697-2|location=New York|pages=153\u2013187}}</ref>\n\nAfter getting released from the hospital, Franco Magnani considered, but ultimately rejected medical possibilities that were suggested. These possibilities included some sort of freudian splitting of the ego which could have resulted in hypermnesia hysteria. While Magnani rejected these notions, he never allowed them to be properly explored.<ref name=\":2\" /> Once relocating to San Francisco, Magnani picked up painting, which he had no formal training in. His first painting was of his childhood home in Pontito. Magnani painted the house in remarkable accuracy, so much so that he himself was amazed. This was especially surprising considering the fact that at this point, Magnani had not been to Pontito in over 25 years. Over time, he grew an obsession to painting the town in which he grew up in, famed psychologist Oliver Sacks noted in 1987, Magnini seemed \"possessed.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThat same year, photographer Susan Schwartzenberg went to Pontito to photograph the scenes of many of Magnani's paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was done as part of a study to document the astonishing accuracy of the artists work. This study would be revealed in an art exhibit on memory in 1988. This garnered lots of attention by researchers such as Bob Miller who suggested that this work could reveal the accuracy, distortions, and inventions of Magnani's memory. These photographs showed something interesting about Magnani's work that was not previously evident. The Exploratorium, which hosted the exhibit for which Schwartzenberg took photos for, explains this observation while examining a drawing of a church. \"This drawing, looking down from a point high above the path approaching the church, shows a view that Magnani could never have seen.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Work done by Baddley and Hitch in 1974<ref>{{Citation|title=Baddeley's model of working memory|date=2019-12-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory&oldid=930708873|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> showed the importance of the visuospatial sketchpad in their model of working memory.

His visual sensory information was stored long term which he was able to recall more than a quarter of a century later in intricate detail. This prompted praise from Sacks, stating that this rare phenomenon made him an eidetic artist.<ref name=\":2\" /> Sacks went on to say, \"he could seemingly reproduce with almost photographic accuracy every building, every street, every stone of Pontito, far away, close up, from any possible angle.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Mnemonists==\nA [[mnemonic device]] is a memory aid that is used to help an individual remember and recall information. Mnemonic devices are usually verbal, such as a special phrase, word or a short poem that individuals are familiar with.\n\nEach individual has two types of memory, termed \"natural memory\" and \"artificial memory\".<ref name=parker/> Mnemonic strategy is said to help develop artificial memory through learning and practicing [[Art of memory|memory techniques]].<ref name=parker/>\n\nCommon mnemonics for memorizing lists of words is through the use of acronym, which is the abbreviation that consists of the initial letter in a phrase or word. For example, HOMES is often used to help remember the names of the [[Great Lakes]] of North America. Most techniques for memorizing numbers involve turning the numbers into visual images that are then placed along points of an imaginary [[Method of loci|memory journey]]. The mind has difficulty remembering abstract concepts like numbers, but can easily remember visual images. The imaginary memory journey orders the images in the correct sequence. Two common techniques for converting numbers and playing cards into visual images are the [[Mnemonic major system]] and the [[Mnemonic dominic system]].\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nNo structural differences have been found in the brains of accomplished memorists, who have achieved superior memory with the practiced use of mnemonic devices. One study that sought to locate the neural differences between these and people with typical memory abilities using [[fMRI]], was unable to find any differences. For memorists, the right [[cingulate cortex]], [[ventral fusiform cortex]], and left posterior [[inferior frontal sulcus]] were more active for [[Piphilology|digit span memorization]] (a feat memorists are often very good at).<ref name=maguire>Maguire, E.

There are several anecdotal reports of \"S\" recalling a speech word for word without taking notes along with his peers.\n\nAnother interesting case of recall is of the subject S.F., who began testing with an average intelligence and average memory capabilities. With the use of mnemonic strategies (practice sessions in the laboratory) he was able to increase his digit span from 7 to 79.<ref name=ericson>Ericsson, A, Chase, W, & Faloon, S Acquisition of a memory skill.

Qualifying times). Using mnemonics for memory recall may also have played a part in [[Akira Haraguchi]]'s world record citation of mathematical pi. Cases such as these suggest that superior memory can be achieved with the proper mnemonic techniques.\n\nAlso all competitors of the annual [[World Memory Championships]] name mnemonic strategies the source for their performances (including performances like memorizing a list of more than 2000 digits in an hour, 280 words in 15 minutes or the order of a deck of cards in under 25 seconds).\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n[[Solomon Shereshevskii]], or 'S', was viewed by peers as disorganized and unintelligent.

Central coherence is a style of [[cognitive processing]] indicative of an autistic individual, which involves a focus on local features during processing.

These events are usually shocking and with photographic quality. Brown and Kulik, who coined the term, found that many highly emotional memories can be recalled with very accurate details, even when there is a delay after the event.<ref name=brown>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = R. | last2 = Kulik | first2 = J. | year = 1977 | title = Flashbulb memories | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 73\u201399 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(77)90018-X }}</ref>\n\nA Flashbulb memory is said to be less accurate and less permanent than [[photographic memory|photographic memories]], but its [[forgetting curve]] is less affected by time in comparing to other types of memories.<ref name=markham>Markham, A. N. (Ed.). (8 November 2001). Flashbulb Memory. In Welcome to UIC. Retrieved 2 April 2009, from http://www.uic.edu/classes/comm/comm200am/teamprojects/MemoryTechnologies/Flashbulb_Memory.htm</ref> One important aspect of flashbulb memory is that it involves emotional arousal when the event is being remembered. Therefore, this kind of memory does not have to be accurate, and the accuracy usually decreases during the first 3 months and goes up again at about 12 months.<ref name=markham/> An example of the errors and malleability of flashbulb memories is found in the El Al Flight 1862 crash. Despite widespread photos and videos of the effects of the crash, there is no video evidence of the crash itself. Despite this, when study participants were asked if they witnessed a video of the crash, over 60 percent claimed to have seen the video on television. Some participants were even willing to offer more information such as the angle of the crash or whether the plane was on fire, despite the lack of video. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ost|first=James|last2=Hogbin|first2=Ian|last3=Granhag|first3=P\u00e4r-Anders|date=2006-06-01|title=Altering false reports via confederate influence|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15534510500480273|journal=Social Influence|volume=1|issue=2|pages=105\u2013116|doi=10.1080/15534510500480273|issn=1553-4510}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by Sharot et al. (2006) showed that the rating of vividness of terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, by the participants is related to the physical location of the person when the event happened.<ref name=kensinger>Kensinger, E. A. (2009). [http://emr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/1/2/99 \"Remembering the Details: Effects of Emotion\"]. ''The International Society for Research on Emotion''. 99\u2013113. Retrieved April 2, 2009</ref> \n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nThe focus of the research on [[emotional memory]] is on the role of the [[amygdala]].  In one study participants watched either an emotionally arousing film or a neutral film. Results of a [[PET scan]] showed correlation between right [[Archistriatum|Amygdaloid Complex]] (AC) activity and recall for emotional elements of the film when participants were asked to remember the film a few weeks later.<ref name=cahill/> Although this study demonstrates the involvement of the AC, it offers no insight as to the specific role of the amygdala. [[James McGaugh|McGaugh]] and colleagues posit that although electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation directly to the amygdala can enhance or decrease memory, the amygdala is not the main site for any [[long-term memory]] storage. Rather, the amygdala acts as a modulator for storage processes occurring in other areas of the brain. Long-term memories are not created automatically, they must be consolidated over time. Research indicates that it is this consolidation process in which the AC plays an assisting role (there is no evidence that it aids in retrieval). Specifically, McGaugh suggests that emotional arousal activates the amygdala, which regulates the strength of a memory, lending to enhanced memory for emotionally charged events.<ref name=roozendaal>McGaugh, J. L., Cahill, L., & Roozendaal, B. (1996). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage: interaction with other brain systems, 93(24), 13508-13514.</ref>\n\nThe amygdala itself is a collection of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] with distinct functions, the basolateral AC the most involved with memory.<ref name=cahill/> The BL projects into the hippocampus and [[entorhinal cortex]] and stimulation of the AC functioning activates both of these areas.<ref name=cahill/> Further indication that the amygdala works to modulate other areas of the brain is supported by the fact that AC stimulation is mediated by the [[stria terminalis]] (ST), a major AC pathway. Lesions of the ST block AC stimulation effects.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nAC and ST lesions also appear to block [[hormonal]] and [[adrenaline]] enhancements. [[Stress hormones]] produced by emotional situations influence memory storage. Memory can also be selectively enhanced by post-training administration of drugs and hormones. It is also well known that emotional situations produce an \"[[Fight-or-flight response|adrenaline rush]]\". This adrenaline, as well as [[cortisol]] (adrenocortical hormone) serve to influence an organism's response to stress, but also may aid future responding by enhancing declarative memory of them.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nNegative emotional experiences may be remembered better than positive experiences. [[Ben Goddard|Goddard]] found that retention was disrupted with electrical stimulation of AC after aversive learning, but not with appetitively motivated learning.\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAn experience must be very arousing to an individual for it to be consolidated as an [[emotional memory]], and this arousal can be negative, thus causing a negative memory to be strongly retained.<ref name=cahill>{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = L. | last2 = McGaugh | first2 = J.L. | year = 1998 | title = Mechanisms of emotional arousal and lasting declarative memory | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b27/f7ccbc68e6bf9bc1538f7ed8d1ca9d8e563a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 21 | issue = 7| pages = 294\u2013299 | doi = 10.1016/s0166-2236(97)01214-9 }}</ref>  Having a long-lasting extremely vivid and detailed memory for negative events can cause a great deal of [[anxiety]], as seen in [[post-traumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorders]].
