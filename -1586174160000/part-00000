Therefore, the tour began in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], on 18 May 1978, and ended in Miami on 5 August 1978. The tour was divided into three legs, two U.S. legs and one European leg between. Before the tour Marley performed at the [[One Love Peace Concert]] on 22 April 1978.\n\nNumerous concerts including the performances in Paris' Pavillon Baltard were recorded in order to release a second live album, ''[[Babylon by Bus]]'' which is a compilation of songs performed in Paris as well as from earlier shows from the tours in 1975 and 1976.\n\nOn 21 July, [[Peter Tosh]], who was on tour with [[The Rolling Stones]] and performing in Anaheim, stopped by the [[Starlight Bowl (Burbank, California)|Starlight Bowl]] in Burbank (where Bob was playing) and performed \"[[Get Up, Stand Up]]\" with Marley. [[Mick Jagger]] is said to have watched the entire show from off stage.\n\nOn 23 July, the birthday of Ethiopian emperor [[Haile Selassie]], reincarnated God of the [[Rastafari movement]], Marley performed in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and did a very rare live performance of his song ''[[Sun Is Shining (Bob Marley and the Wailers song)|Sun Is Shining]]''.\n\nWhile on the tour Marley performed for the first time in Spain and Norway, and also premiered at the [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\n[[Steel Pulse]] were the opening act on several of Marley's European dates on the tour.\n\n== Setlist ==\nAfter the first quarter of the tour the setlists became more standardised and mostly looked like the following:\n\n* \"Positive Vibration\"\n* \"them Belly Full (but We Hungry)\"\n* \"Concrete Jungle\"\n* \"Rebel Music (3 O'Clock Roadblock)\"\n* \"the Heathen\"\n* \"[[War (Bob Marley song)|War]]\" / \"No More Trouble\" (medley)\n* \"Running Away\" / \"Crazy Baldhead\" (medley)\n* \"Crisis\"\n* \"I Shot The Sheriff\"\n* \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\"\n* \"[[Is This Love (Bob Marley & The Wailers song)|is this Love]]\"\n* \"[[Jamming (song)|Jamming]]\"\n* \"Lively Up Yourself\"\n* \"Easy Skanking\"\n* \"[[Get Up, Stand Up]]\"\n* \"Exodus\"\n\nAt the beginning of the tour a [[Nyabinghi rhythm|Nyabinghi]] chant called \"So Long Rastafari\" (sometimes as a medley with \"Time Will Tell\") had been performed at the start of the show, followed by \"Concrete Jungle\", \"Burnin' and Lootin'\" and \"them Belly Full (but We Hungry)\". Since the Nyabinghi chant was very meditative and slow until it segued into the lively reggae beat of \"Concrete Jungle\", it was decided to replace the chant by the classic and instantly lively \"Positive Vibration\" to better catch the audience from the beginning. The same procedure was done at the beginning of the [[Rastaman Vibration Tour]] in 1976 when a medley of Nyabinghi chants, like \"Lion of Judah\" and \"Rastaman Chant\", opened the sets, but was later replaced.\n\nIt is reported that all songs from the Kaya album had been performed at least once. There are reports of various people (concert attenders, band members) that Marley did unusual long concerts in Ann Arbor Michigan, Lenox, Massachusetts, and Oslo (Norway), each with a setlist full of rarely performed songs. There were also performances of an earlier song, \"Punky Reggae Party\", which is not featured on any of Marley's Island albums released at that time, but was released as a single in 1977. When performed it was part of a medley along with \"[[Get Up, Stand Up]]\".\n\nFrom show to show sometimes an additional song was edged in somewhere in the setlist, like \"Slave Driver\", \"Burnin' and Lootin'\", \"Punky Reggae Party\", \"Kaya\", \"[[Sun Is Shining (Bob Marley and the Wailers song)|Sun Is Shining]]\", \"Time Will Tell\", \"One Love\", \"Natural Mystic\", \"[[Waiting in Vain]]\", \"So Much Things To Say\", \"Talkin' Blues\", \"Who the Cap Fit\", \"Rat Race\" and \"Roots, Rock, Reggae\". Live performances of each of these songs happened very rarely during the tour.\n\n== Tour dates ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"150\"| Date\n! width=\"150\"| City\n!

Unlike the pyramidal structure of the [[Sicilian Mafia]], the Camorra's organizational structure is more horizontal than vertical. Consequently, individual Camorra clans act independently, and are more prone to feuding among themselves. The Camorra's main businesses are [[Drug Trafficking|drug trafficking]], [[racketeering]], [[counterfeiting]] and [[money laundering]].\n\nSince the early 1980s and its involvement in the drug trafficking business, Camorra has acquired a strong presence in other European countries, particularly Spain, but also in nations of South America. Little is known about  current leader \u2018Ezio Auditoris Da Roma\u2019. Other then he is considered one of the youngest leading bosses of this new generation. \n\nAccording to Naples public prosecutor Giovanni Melillo, during a 2019 speech of the [[Antimafia Commission]], the most powerful groups of the Camorra in the present day are the [[Mazzarella clan]] and the [[Secondigliano Alliance]].

The first official mention of the Camorra as an organisation dates from 1820, when police records detail a disciplinary meeting of the Camorra, a tribunal known as the ''Gran Mamma''. That year the first written statute of the Camorra, the ''frieno'', was discovered, indicating a stable organisational structure in the underworld. Another statute was discovered in 1842, related to initiation rites and funds set aside for the families of those imprisoned. The organisation was also known as the ''Bella Societ\u00e0 Riformata'', ''Societ\u00e0 dell'Umirt\u00e0'' or ''Onorata Societ\u00e0''.<ref name=behan12>Behan, ''The Camorra'', pp. 12</ref><ref name=sales72>Sales, ''La camorra, le camorre'', pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nThe evolution into more organised formations indicated a qualitative change: the Camorra and ''camorristi'' were no longer local gangs living off theft and extortion; they had a fixed structure and some kind of hierarchy. Another qualitative leap was the agreement between the liberal opposition and the Camorra, following the defeat of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|1848 revolution]]. The liberals realised that they needed popular support to overthrow the king. They turned to the Camorra and paid them because the ''camorristi'' were the leaders of the city's poor. The new police chief, [[Liborio Romano]], appealed to the head of the Camorra, Salvatore De Crescenzo, to maintain order and appointed him as head of the municipal guard.<ref name=paliotti149>{{in lang|it}} Paliotti, ''Storia della Camorra'', pp. 149\u2013153</ref> In a few decades, the Camorra had developed into power brokers.<ref name=behan12/> In 1869, [[Ciccio Cappuccio]] was elected as the ''capintesta'' (head-in-chief) of the Camorra by the twelve district heads (''capintriti''), succeeding De Crescenzo after a short interregnum.<ref name=paliotti143>{{in lang|it}} Paliotti, ''Storia della Camorra'', p. 143</ref> Nicknamed \"The king of Naples\" (\"o rre 'e Napole\"), he died in 1892.<ref name=mat061292>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=27 La morte di Ciccio Cappuccio], Il Mattino, December 6, 1892</ref><ref name=fiore96>{{in lang|it}} Di Fiore, ''Potere camorrista: quattro secoli di malanapoli'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xmxoTqJUkL8C&pg=PA96 p. 96\u201397]</ref>\n\nFollowing Italian unification in 1861, the government made attempts to suppress the Camorra. From 1882, it conducted a series of manhunts.

This high camorra strikes deals and does business with the low camorra, swapping promises for favours and favours for promises. The high camorra thinks of the state bureaucracy as being like a field it has to harvest and exploit. Its tools are cunning, nerve and violence. Its strength comes from the streets. And it is rightly considered to be more dangerous, because it has re-established the worst form of despotism by founding a regime based on bullying.

Each group was bound by kinship ties and controlled economic activities that took place in its particular geographic territory. Each took care of its own business, protected its territory, and sometimes tried to expand at another group's expense. There was some minimal coordination to avoid mutual interference. The families competed to maintain a system of checks and balances among equal powers.<ref name=jacq24>Jacquemet, ''Credibility in Court'', p. 24</ref>\n\nOne of the Camorra's strategies to gain social prestige was and remains political patronage. The family clans became the preferred go-betweens of local politicians and public officials because of their grip on the community. In turn, the family bosses used their political sway to assist and protect their clients against the local authorities. Through a mixture of brute force, political status, and social leadership, the Camorra clans gained ground as middlemen between the local community and bureaucrats and politicians at national level. They granted privileges and protection, and intervened in favour of their clients, in return for their silence and connivance against local authorities and the police. With their political connections, the heads of the major Neapolitan families became power brokers in local and national political contexts, providing Neapolitan politicians with broad electoral support, and in return receiving benefits for their constituency.<ref name=jacq24/>\n\n==Activities==\nCompared to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]'s pyramidal structure, the Camorra has more of a 'horizontal' than a 'vertical' structure.<ref>https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/86/2/457/5060718</ref> As a result, Camorra clans act independently of each other and are more prone to feuding. This, however, makes the Camorra more resilient when top leaders are arrested or killed, with new clans and organisations emerging from the remnants of old ones. Clan leader [[Pasquale Galasso]] stated in court; \"Campania can get worse because you could cut into a Camorra group, but another ten could emerge from it.\"<ref name=behan184>Behan, ''Camorra'', pp. 184</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, [[Raffaele Cutolo]] made an unsuccessful attempt to unify the Camorra families in the manner of the Sicilian Mafia, by forming the [[Nuova Camorra Organizzata|New Organized Camorra]] (''Nuova Camorra Organizzata'' or ''NCO''). [[Drive-by shooting]]s by ''camorristi'' often result in casualties among the local population but such episodes are often difficult to investigate because of the widespread practise of [[omert\u00e0]] (code of silence). According to a report published in 2007 by Confesercenti, the second-largest Italian trade organisation, the Camorra control the milk and fish industries, the coffee trade, and over 2,500 bakeries in Naples.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article1292115/Die_Mafia_ist_Italiens_fuehrendes_Unternehmen.html \"Die Mafia ist Italiens f\u00fchrendes Unternehmen\"], [[Die Welt]], October 23, 2007</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Italian law enforcement estimated that there were about a dozen Camorra clans.

Saviano said Scotland's third city, with no history of organized crime, was seen as an attractive safe haven away from the violent inter-gang bloodletting that had engulfed their Neapolitan stronghold of Mondragone. Saviano claims that before the Italian clans arrived, Aberdeen did not know how to exploit its resources for recreation and tourism. He further states that the Italians infused the city with economic energy, revitalised the tourist industry, inspired new import-export activities and injected new vigour in the real-estate sector. It thereby turned Aberdeen into a chic, elegant address for fine dining and important dealings.<ref name=Horne/>\n\nThe hub of La Torre's UK empire, Pavarotti's restaurant, now under different ownership, was even feted at Italissima, a prestigious gastronomic fair held in Paris. The restaurant was even advertised on the city's local tourist guides. Saviano further claims to have gone to Aberdeen and worked in a restaurant run by Antonio La Torre. The Camorristas operated a system known as \"scratch\" where they used to step up illegal activities if their legitimate ventures were struggling. If cash was short they had counterfeit notes printed; if capital was needed in a hurry, they sold bogus treasury bonds. They annihilated the competition through extortions and imported merchandise tax-free. The Camorra were able to run all sort of deals because the local police had virtually no experience in dealing with organized crime. Although they broke the law, there were never any guns or serious violence, due to lack of rivals.<ref name=Horne/>\n\nHowever, the suggestion that the city remains in the grip of mobsters has been strongly denied by leaders of the 300 strong Italian community in Aberdeen.

The first official mention of the Camorra as an organisation dates from 1820, when police records detail a disciplinary meeting of the Camorra, a tribunal known as the ''Gran Mamma''. That year the first written statute of the Camorra, the ''frieno'', was discovered, indicating a stable organisational structure in the underworld. Another statute was discovered in 1842, related to initiation rites and funds set aside for the families of those imprisoned. The organisation was also known as the ''Bella Societ\u00e0 Riformata'', ''Societ\u00e0 dell'Umirt\u00e0'' or ''Onorata Societ\u00e0''.<ref name=behan12>Behan, ''The Camorra'', pp. 12</ref><ref name=sales72>Sales, ''La camorra, le camorre'', pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nThe evolution into more organised formations indicated a qualitative change: the Camorra and ''camorristi'' were no longer local gangs living off theft and extortion; they had a fixed structure and some kind of hierarchy. Another qualitative leap was the agreement between the liberal opposition and the Camorra, following the defeat of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|1848 revolution]]. The liberals realised that they needed popular support to overthrow the king. They turned to the Camorra and paid them because the ''camorristi'' were the leaders of the city's poor. The new police chief, [[Liborio Romano]], appealed to the head of the Camorra, Salvatore De Crescenzo, to maintain order and appointed him as head of the municipal guard.<ref name=paliotti149>{{in lang|it}} Paliotti, ''Storia della Camorra'', pp. 149\u2013153</ref> In a few decades, the Camorra had developed into power brokers.<ref name=behan12/> In 1869, [[Ciccio Cappuccio]] was elected as the ''capintesta'' (head-in-chief) of the Camorra by the twelve district heads (''capintriti''), succeeding De Crescenzo after a short interregnum.<ref name=paliotti143>{{in lang|it}} Paliotti, ''Storia della Camorra'', p. 143</ref> Nicknamed \"The king of Naples\" (\"o rre 'e Napole\"), he died in 1892.<ref name=mat061292>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=27 La morte di Ciccio Cappuccio], Il Mattino, December 6, 1892</ref><ref name=fiore96>{{in lang|it}} Di Fiore, ''Potere camorrista: quattro secoli di malanapoli'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xmxoTqJUkL8C&pg=PA96 p. 96\u201397]</ref>\n\nFollowing Italian unification in 1861, the government made attempts to suppress the Camorra. From 1882, it conducted a series of manhunts. The [[Saredo Inquiry]] (1900\u20131901), established to investigate corruption and bad governance in Naples, identified a system of political patronage run by what the report called the \"high Camorra\":\n{{quote|The original ''low camorra'' held sway over the poor plebs in an age of abjection and servitude. Then there arose a ''high camorra'' comprising the most cunning and audacious members of the middle class. They fed off trade and public works contracts, political meetings and government bureaucracy. This high camorra strikes deals and does business with the low camorra, swapping promises for favours and favours for promises. The high camorra thinks of the state bureaucracy as being like a field it has to harvest and exploit. Its tools are cunning, nerve and violence. Its strength comes from the streets. And it is rightly considered to be more dangerous, because it has re-established the worst form of despotism by founding a regime based on bullying. The high camorra has replaced free will with impositions, it has nullified individuality and liberty, and it has defrauded the law and public trust.<ref name=machetti>{{in lang|it}} ''[http://www.rivistameridiana.it/files/Machetti,-La-lobby-di-piazza-Municipio.pdf La lobby di piazza Municipio: gli impiegati comunali nella Napoli di fine Ottocento]'', by Giulio Machetti, ''Meridiana'', pp. 38\u201339, 2000</ref><ref name=dickie88>Dickie, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=c7v3UWkI8LEC&pg=PT88 pp. 88\u201389]</ref>}}\n\nThe inquiry introduced the terminology of \"high Camorra\", as having a bourgeois character, and distinct from the plebeian Camorra proper.

Each group was bound by kinship ties and controlled economic activities that took place in its particular geographic territory. Each took care of its own business, protected its territory, and sometimes tried to expand at another group's expense. There was some minimal coordination to avoid mutual interference. The families competed to maintain a system of checks and balances among equal powers.<ref name=jacq24>Jacquemet, ''Credibility in Court'', p. 24</ref>\n\nOne of the Camorra's strategies to gain social prestige was and remains political patronage. The family clans became the preferred go-betweens of local politicians and public officials because of their grip on the community. In turn, the family bosses used their political sway to assist and protect their clients against the local authorities. Through a mixture of brute force, political status, and social leadership, the Camorra clans gained ground as middlemen between the local community and bureaucrats and politicians at national level. They granted privileges and protection, and intervened in favour of their clients, in return for their silence and connivance against local authorities and the police. With their political connections, the heads of the major Neapolitan families became power brokers in local and national political contexts, providing Neapolitan politicians with broad electoral support, and in return receiving benefits for their constituency.<ref name=jacq24/>\n\n==Activities==\nCompared to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]'s pyramidal structure, the Camorra has more of a 'horizontal' than a 'vertical' structure.<ref>https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/86/2/457/5060718</ref> As a result, Camorra clans act independently of each other and are more prone to feuding. This, however, makes the Camorra more resilient when top leaders are arrested or killed, with new clans and organisations emerging from the remnants of old ones. Clan leader [[Pasquale Galasso]] stated in court; \"Campania can get worse because you could cut into a Camorra group, but another ten could emerge from it.\"<ref name=behan184>Behan, ''Camorra'', pp. 184</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, [[Raffaele Cutolo]] made an unsuccessful attempt to unify the Camorra families in the manner of the Sicilian Mafia, by forming the [[Nuova Camorra Organizzata|New Organized Camorra]] (''Nuova Camorra Organizzata'' or ''NCO''). [[Drive-by shooting]]s by ''camorristi'' often result in casualties among the local population but such episodes are often difficult to investigate because of the widespread practise of [[omert\u00e0]] (code of silence). According to a report published in 2007 by Confesercenti, the second-largest Italian trade organisation, the Camorra control the milk and fish industries, the coffee trade, and over 2,500 bakeries in Naples.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article1292115/Die_Mafia_ist_Italiens_fuehrendes_Unternehmen.html \"Die Mafia ist Italiens f\u00fchrendes Unternehmen\"], [[Die Welt]], October 23, 2007</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Italian law enforcement estimated that there were about a dozen Camorra clans.

The Camorristas operated a system known as \"scratch\" where they used to step up illegal activities if their legitimate ventures were struggling. If cash was short they had counterfeit notes printed; if capital was needed in a hurry, they sold bogus treasury bonds. They annihilated the competition through extortions and imported merchandise tax-free. The Camorra were able to run all sort of deals because the local police had virtually no experience in dealing with organized crime. Although they broke the law, there were never any guns or serious violence, due to lack of rivals.<ref name=Horne/>\n\nHowever, the suggestion that the city remains in the grip of mobsters has been strongly denied by leaders of the 300 strong Italian community in Aberdeen.
