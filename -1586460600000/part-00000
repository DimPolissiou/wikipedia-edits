To this end, Millennium 3D Chess has not \"created\" new chess rules, but instead extended the traditional rules to allow for multi-board (multi-level) play. Other than the concept of moving between chess boards (levels), all traditional two-dimensional chess rules apply.\n\n[[File:Millennium 3D Chess Abridged Rules.pdf|thumb|Millennium 3D Chess Abridged Rules.]]\n\nThe strategy for playing Millennium 3D Chess is similar to playing a traditional (2D) with a few exceptions.  Millennium 3D Chess is played a multi-level environment without distorting the basic chess game. Other than the concept of moving between chess boards (levels), all traditional two-dimensional chess rules apply.\n\n[[File:Millennium 3D Chess Strategy.pdf|thumb|Strategy for playing Millennium 3D Chess.]]\n\nThe three board levels are denoted ''1'',  ''2'' (the middle board), and ''3''. Moves are recorded in the same manner as chess, using [[algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]], with the only difference that each square is prefaced by its level number. The [[White and Black in chess|white and black]] armies begin, in standard formation, on boards 1 and 3 respectively.\n\nFor example, in standard chess, White's [[King (chess)|king]] starts on square e1 and Black's king starts on square e8. In Millennium 3D chess, White's king starts on ''1e1'' and Black's king starts on ''3e8''.\n\nAll pieces can always move as normal whilst staying on the same board. Additionally, every piece is able to move between boards. Each piece's additional permitted movement in the third dimension is extrapolated from its traditional movement as follows:\n*[[king (chess)|Kings]] can move one square up or down in addition to their regular movement.\n*[[knight (chess)|Knights]]' L-shaped move can involve moving one or two steps up or down. As in standard chess, the knight is the only piece able to \"jump\" over other pieces.\n*[[bishop (chess)|Bishops]] can move up or down one or two boards, as long as it also moves the same number of squares in a diagonal direction.\n*[[rook (chess)|Rook]]s can move vertically up and down while not moving in the other two dimensions. Additionally, a rook can move an equal number of squares vertically as it does in one of the lateral dimensions.\n*A [[queen (chess)|Queen]] moves as the bishop and rook combined.\n*[[Pawn (chess)|Pawns]] can move one square up or down whilst staying in the same position laterally, or they can advance one square and additionally move one board up or down. A pawn's first move can, optionally, be two squares vertically, or two squares forward and two squares vertically. Pawns can capture diagonally forwards on boards immediately above and below. ''[[En passant]]'' rules allow capture on the square passed through on a two-step first move, but a pawn cannot be captured ''en passant'' if its first move is two squares vertically only. [[Promotion (chess)|Promotion]] requires the pawn to reach the opponent's back rank and starting board, i.e. white promotes at rank 8 of board 3, and black promotes at rank 1 of board 1.\n{{clear}}\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|{{3D_chess_diagram\n|\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n\n| Diagram of initial setup\n}}\n| {{3D_chess_diagram\n| \n|\n\n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |nd \n|oo|  |  |  |  |xo|  |\n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |xo|  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|rl|oo|oo|oo|oo|oo|oo|oo\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |xo|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |xo\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |xo|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |xo\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |oo|  |  |  |  |  \n\n| Movement of the rook and knight\n}}\n|-\n| {{3D_chess_diagram\n|\n|\n\n|  |  |  |xo|  |xo|oo|xo \n|  |  |  |  |  |oo|  |\n|  |  |  |xo|oo|xo|  |xo\n|  |  |  |oo|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |oo|xo|  |xo|  |xo\n|  |oo|  |  |  |  |  |  \n|bl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |oo|  |  |  |  |  |  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | |  \n|  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo|  \n|  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo|  \n|  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |oo|  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |oo|  |  |  |  |  |  \n\n|  |  |  |xo|  |xo|  |xo\n|  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo|  \n|xo|xo|xo|xo|xo|qd|xo|xo\n|  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo|  \n|  |  |oo|xo|  |xo|  |xo\n|  |  |xo|  |  |xo|  |  \n|  |xo|  |  |  |xo|  |  \n|xo|  |  |  |  |xo|  |  \n\n| Movement of the bishop and queen\n}}\n| {{3D_chess_diagram\n|\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |ox|oo|ox|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |oo|  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|ox|  |  |  |xo|xo|xo  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |xo|kd|xo  \n|  |  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |ox|oo|ox|  |\n|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|ox|  |  |  |xo|xo|xo  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo  \n|  |  |  |  |  |xo|xo|xo  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |ox|oo|ox|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |oo|  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|oo|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n\n| Movement of the pawn and king.

Varuzhan and his fellow intellectualists organized the first Armenian hetanist group/organization - ''Mehian,'' which printed articles about armenian nationalism and Hetanism. According to the ideology of Varuzhan and his followers, the Christian ideology of \"[[Turn the other cheek|turning the cheek]]\" has become a disaster for the Armenian nation, which before was a great nation with brave soldiers and wise rulers. According to them, the Armenian nation fell low after the acceptance of Christianity and became a slave to the west and the east.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Garegin Nzhdeh ===\n[[File:Garegin_Nzhdeh_5.jpg|thumb|Garegin Nzhdeh, the ideologue of an Armenian \"national religion\".]]\n\n[[Garegin Nzhdeh]] is considered one of the most important figures of the armenian history. He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\n=== Theology and cosmology ===\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Ar]]\n\n==== Ar and Ara ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]: According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, who was the creator of the reality .{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n==== Deities ====\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar. They are not separate beings, but merely different manifestations of Ar. Though monotheistic in theology, the Armenian Native Faith is mostly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Name\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Also known as\n!Details\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |[[Hayk]]\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aramazd, Khaldi\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The primary God of ancient armenians, head of the pantheon, manifestation of fatherhood, the earth and the sky. He was called almighty and all-father. His temple was in Kamakh, Ani province, which also was a grave for Armenian kings of the [[Artaxiad|artaxiad dynasty of Armenia.]] Along with Anahit and Vahagn contituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Anahit\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Teisheba\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Daughter of Aramazd. She was the mother god, and was pictured with a long veil coming down from her hair, she was referenced to as the great mother Anahit, the good-bringer, maifestation of motherhood and the personofication and mother-protector of Armenia. It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live. Armenian kings, before enacting decisions or going to wars would ask the goddess for approval and tips, to succee in what they plan. She was also the devine manifestation  and personofication of motherhood and fertility.\nTogether with Aramazd and Vahagn she constituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Vahagn\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aray, Demetr\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The third God of the pantheon was Vahagn, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky. \nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik, Astlik\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Astghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite. She was the goddess of love and water. According to folk tradition, Vahagn met Astghik in the field of Ararat.

Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Afterlife and eschatology ===\nHetanists have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between light and dark unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn is born again and brings the warrior forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}}\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\n=== Holidays ===\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n{{Neopaganism}}\n\n[[Category:Modern Pagan traditions]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism by country]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hetanism}}\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Hetanism}}\n{{short description|Armenian Neopaganism}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{sidebar\n|name = Armenian Native Faith\n|title = [[Hetanism]]<br />and [[Armenian mythology]]\n|image = [[File:Left-Facing Armenian Eternity Sign UC 058E SVG.svg|150px]]\n|caption = Arevakhach, symbol of hetanism\n|captionstyle = font-style:italic\n|headingstyle = background:#B0CBAC\n|contentclass = hlist\n\n|heading1 = Practices\n|content1 =\n* [[Pantheism]]\n* Semi-[[Polytheistic]] [[Monotheism]]\n* [[Matagh]]\n* [[Knunk]]\n* [[Vardavar]]\n* [[Fire worship]]\n* [[List of water deities|Water woship]]\n* [[Veneration of the dead|Worship of ancestors]]\n\n|heading2 = Places\n|content2 =\n* [[Garni temple]]\n* [[Zorats qarer]]\n* [[Khustup mountain]]\n\n|heading3 = Deities and beings\n|content3 =\n* Ar\n* [[Hayk]] (Aramazd)\n* [[Anahit]]\n* [[Vahagn]]\n* [[Tir]]\n* [[Mihr]]\n* [[Vanatur]]\n* [[Ara the Beautiful]]\n* [[Turk' Angegh]]\n* [[Nane]]\n* [[Astghik]]\n* [[Spandaramet]]\n* [[Barshamin]]\n|heading4 = Ancient Sources\n|content4 =\n* [[Moses of Chorene]]\n* [[Anania Shirakatsi]]\n* [[Ukhtagirq]]\n\n}}\n'''Hetanism''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0540\u0565\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 ''Hetanosutiwn'') or '''Armenian native faith''', was the dominant<ref name=\"Romeny 2010\">{{Cite book|last=Romeny|first=R.

Varuzhan and his fellow intellectualists organized the first Armenian hetanist group/organization - ''Mehian,'' which printed articles about armenian nationalism and Hetanism. According to the ideology of Varuzhan and his followers, the Christian ideology of \"[[Turn the other cheek|turning the cheek]]\" has become a disaster for the Armenian nation, which before was a great nation with brave soldiers and wise rulers. According to them, the Armenian nation fell low after the acceptance of Christianity and became a slave to the west and the east.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Garegin Nzhdeh ===\n[[File:Garegin_Nzhdeh_5.jpg|thumb|Garegin Nzhdeh, the ideologue of an Armenian \"national religion\".]]\n\n[[Garegin Nzhdeh]] is considered one of the most important figures of the armenian history. He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\n=== Theology and cosmology ===\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Ar]]\n\n==== Ar and Ara ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]: According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, who was the creator of the reality .{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n==== Deities ====\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar. They are not separate beings, but merely different manifestations of Ar. Though monotheistic in theology, the Armenian Native Faith is mostly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Name\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Also known as\n!Details\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |[[Hayk]]\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aramazd, Khaldi\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The primary God of ancient armenians, head of the pantheon, manifestation of fatherhood, the earth and the sky. He was called almighty and all-father. His temple was in Kamakh, Ani province, which also was a grave for Armenian kings of the [[Artaxiad|artaxiad dynasty of Armenia.]] Along with Anahit and Vahagn contituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Anahit\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Teisheba\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Daughter of Aramazd. She was the mother god, and was pictured with a long veil coming down from her hair, she was referenced to as the great mother Anahit, the good-bringer, maifestation of motherhood and the personofication and mother-protector of Armenia. It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live. Armenian kings, before enacting decisions or going to wars would ask the goddess for approval and tips, to succee in what they plan. She was also the devine manifestation  and personofication of motherhood and fertility.\nTogether with Aramazd and Vahagn she constituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Vahagn\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aray, Demetr\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The third God of the pantheon was Vahagn, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky. \nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik, Astlik\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Astghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite.

Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Afterlife and eschatology ===\nHetanists have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between light and dark unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn is born again and brings the warrior forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself.

To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n{{Neopaganism}}\n\n[[Category:Modern Pagan traditions]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism by country]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "name_user": "\u054d\u0561\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0567\u056c", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Native_Faith"}

Colonel C.D. Murray was the agent at Kokomo for stock subscriptions in support of the railroad. In 1852 the construction of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad commenced. In Kokomo Samuel C. Mills and Dr. Corydon Richmond, commercial competitors of David Foster, donated several lots to the railroad in order to secure the location of the rail depot near their commercial property. The route was laid along Buckeye Street at the insistence of the merchants who hoped to reduced drayage expenses. Samuel Mills built a large frame structure at the Howard flouring mills, which served as a warehouse for the company's freight and a passenger depot. For some time after 1854 Kokomo was the terminus of the line, but eventually the line was extended to Peru and then to Michigan City.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Railroads\n | last = Pollard | first = Otis C.\n | publisher = by Jackson Morrow (Indianapolis: B.F.

By 1853 a line was commenced between Kokomo and [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] (which was intended to become the hub of a network of lines for the company). Railroad service was inaugurated on that line on July 4, 1855.<ref>Watt, William J. (1999) ''The Pennsylvania Railroad in Indiana''. Indiana University Press. p. 30.</ref>\n\nThe most important rail line for Kokomo became the standard-gauge Clover Leaf line. This railroad would eventually link Kokomo with both the West Coast and the Eastern Seaboard. It began as a short line linking Frankfort and Kokomo, the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]. Henry Y. Morrison of Frankfort was the principal promoter, and A.Y. Comstock acted for him in Kokomo. A failure of the proposed subsidy caused the promoters to turn all assets over to the contractors, who promised to complete the line. Construction began in 1873 and was completed the following year. Limited freight between the two cities made the line unprofitable. After a series of acquisitions by other railroads, the line became part of the [[Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad]]. A line connecting it to the east reached Kokomo on January 1, 1881.<ref>Railroads, pp. 419\u201320.</ref>\n\n===Mayor Cole===\nIn 1881, one of the most remarkable and controversial events in Kokomo's history took place. Mayor Henry C. Cole was shot to death by a sheriff's posse. Dr. Cole had a curious history and had stirred up a great deal of passion in the previous fifteen years. He was reputed to have been a gifted surgeon, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War and when afterwards he settled in Kokomo, he became a prominent physician.

In March 1886, a group of citizens, led principally by A.Y. Comstock (who had promoted the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]) and D.C. Spraker (later President of Kokomo Rubber Company), circulated a memorandum seeking subscribers (at $100 each) for the purpose of boring for gas at a distance of at least {{convert|2000|ft}} below ground. It took until September to obtain the necessary 22 subscribers.

White was a teenage hemophiliac who had been infected with [[HIV]] through contaminated blood products (Factor 8). At the time blood products were often collected through state prison systems. Factor 8 was made from pooled plasma of thousands of donors. Later the plasma was screened for HIV and Hepatitis and heat treated to inactive HIV and Hepatitis. The teen had been attending [[Western School Corporation|Western Middle School]] (which is actually in [[Russiaville, Indiana|Russiaville]]) but was ostracized by his classmates, and forced to eat lunch alone and use a separate restroom. Many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied in support of banning White from attending the school. A lengthy administrative appeal process with the school system ensued, followed by death threats and violence against White and his family, including a bullet being fired through the window of their Kokomo home. Media coverage of the case made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCMr9jbq3Tk|title=AIDS Boy Banned From Attending School - 1st August 1985|first=|last=CampaignTB|date=November 2, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=August 18, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 1987, the White family left Kokomo for [[Cicero, Indiana]]. Ryan attended [[Hamilton Heights School Corporation|Hamilton Heights High School]] in nearby Arcadia, where he was welcomed by faculty and students.\n\n===Gas tower===\nThe Kokomo Gas Tower had been a symbol of Kokomo since it was constructed in 1954. The tower was {{convert|378|ft}} tall and had a capacity of {{convert|12000000|cuft}}. Due to high maintenance costs of $75,000 a year, and up to $1,000,000 to paint it, the gas company decided to demolish it in 2003. Other ideas were reviewed before settling on this decision, including a plan to turn the tower into a giant [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement. On September 7, 2003, at approximately 7:30&nbsp;a.m., the Gas Tower was demolished by [[Controlled Demolition, Inc.]] (CDI). Pieces of the tower were sold to the public for $20\u201330, and proceeds went to a planned Kokomo technology incubation center and [[Bona Vista (charity)|Bona Vista]].<ref>{{Cite news\n | title = Crowds flooded the intersection of Firmin and Home Avenue\n | newspaper = Kokomo Tribune\n | url = http://kokomotribune.com/archive/x518862403 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120308200658/http://kokomotribune.com/archive/x518862403 | url-status = dead | archive-date = March 8, 2012 | date = December 16, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2016 Tornado ===\n{{Main|2016 Kokomo tornado}}\nOn August 24, 2016 a strong EF3 tornado caused major damage in the southern part of Kokomo. 1,000 homes were damaged, 170 of which sustained major damage. 80 of these homes were destroyed, some sustaining loss of roofs and exterior walls.

The first tornado was rated F0 and caused little damage to homes and trees. The second tornado was rated F1 and caused a roof to collapse at the local skating rink, and damaged three other homes and a truck stop. Both tornadoes caused 1 injury and no fatalities.

Manufacturing operations in the steel plant and on other portions of the property included the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Steel-making operations had included reheating, casting rolling, drawing, pickling, galvanizing, tinning and tempering.\n\nAfter the company filed for bankruptcy in 1986, EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management investigated the plant and property and found soil, sediments, surface water and ground water contaminated with volatile organic compounds (PCBs) and several metals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Lead contamination was also detected in soils on nearby residential properties.\n\nThe site was proposed to the [[National Priorities List]] as a [[Superfund]] site in 1988 and formally added in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Indiana Superfund sites\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/query/queryhtm/nplfin.htm#IN\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, EPA received almost $6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to complete needed cleanup at two problems at the Continental Steel Superfund site: the former Slag Processing Area and the site's contaminated ground water. The ARRA funding helped accelerate the cleanup of hazardous waste on the site. In the process, total of 15 Indiana contractors or subcontractors were involved in the ARRA-funded work, creating at least 45 temporary jobs.\n\nIn August 2010, using the ARRA funds, EPA completed the cleanup of the former slag processing area of the Superfund Site. Approximately {{convert|86000|short ton}} of slag were moved to the site's acid lagoon area for use as fill on that portion of the site. {{convert|2|ft|m|1|spell=In}} of clean soil were used to cap the former slag processing area, leaving it suitable for potential redevelopment. ARRA funds were also used to address contaminated groundwater at the site. This work included extensive groundwater sampling to determine the contaminated plume area and installation of groundwater extraction and monitoring wells. Three wind turbines will be used to generate much of the power needed to operate the groundwater extraction system.\n\nSite cleanup was completed in August 2011.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Region 5 Cleanup Sites, Continental Steel Corp.\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/continental/\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 the former site was approved as the location of a [[Solar farm]] with installation of panels beginning in August 2016.

Some of these potential sources are currently being managed under other authorities but there is no cleanup approach focusing on the ground water plume.

Before the Civil War, it was connected with Indianapolis and then the Eastern cities by railroad, which resulted in sustained growth. Substantial growth came after the discovery of large natural gas reserves, which produced an economic boom in the mid-1880s. Among the businesses which the boom attracted was the fledgling automobile industry. A significant number of technical and engineering innovations were developed in Kokomo, particularly in automobile production, and, as a result, Kokomo became known as the \"City of Firsts.\" A substantial portion of Kokomo's employment still depends on the automobile industry.\n\n==History==\n===Historic Buildings in Kokomo, Indiana===\n[[File:ElliottHouseKokomo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Photograph of the Elliott House in the [[Old Silk Stocking Historic District]]]]\n\nThe following is a list of all the buildings in Kokomo, Indiana, that are listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n*[[Elwood Haynes Museum|Elwood Haynes House]]\n*[[Kokomo City Building]]\n*[[Kokomo Country Club|Kokomo Country Club Golf Course]]\n*[[Kokomo Courthouse Square Historic District]]\n*[[Kokomo High School and Memorial Gymnasium]]\n*[[Lake Erie and Western Depot Historic District]]\n*[[Learner Building]]\n*[[Old Silk Stocking Historic District]]\n*[[Seiberling Mansion]]<ref name=nris>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===Early history and incorporation===\nThe settler tradition says Kokomo was named for Kokomoko or [[Ma-Ko-Ko-Mo]] (meaning \"black walnut\"), shortened to Kokomo, said to have been one of the four sons of [[Jean Baptiste Richardville|Chief Richardville]] last of the chiefs of the [[Miami people]].<ref name=\"Blanchard1883\">{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Charles|date=1883|title=History of Howard and Tipton Counties, Indiana|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=F.A.

Colonel C.D. Murray was the agent at Kokomo for stock subscriptions in support of the railroad. In 1852 the construction of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad commenced. In Kokomo Samuel C. Mills and Dr. Corydon Richmond, commercial competitors of David Foster, donated several lots to the railroad in order to secure the location of the rail depot near their commercial property. The route was laid along Buckeye Street at the insistence of the merchants who hoped to reduced drayage expenses. Samuel Mills built a large frame structure at the Howard flouring mills, which served as a warehouse for the company's freight and a passenger depot. For some time after 1854 Kokomo was the terminus of the line, but eventually the line was extended to Peru and then to Michigan City.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Railroads\n | last = Pollard | first = Otis C.\n | publisher = by Jackson Morrow (Indianapolis: B.F.

By 1853 a line was commenced between Kokomo and [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] (which was intended to become the hub of a network of lines for the company). Railroad service was inaugurated on that line on July 4, 1855.<ref>Watt, William J. (1999) ''The Pennsylvania Railroad in Indiana''. Indiana University Press. p. 30.</ref>\n\nThe most important rail line for Kokomo became the standard-gauge Clover Leaf line. This railroad would eventually link Kokomo with both the West Coast and the Eastern Seaboard. It began as a short line linking Frankfort and Kokomo, the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]. Henry Y. Morrison of Frankfort was the principal promoter, and A.Y. Comstock acted for him in Kokomo. A failure of the proposed subsidy caused the promoters to turn all assets over to the contractors, who promised to complete the line. Construction began in 1873 and was completed the following year. Limited freight between the two cities made the line unprofitable. After a series of acquisitions by other railroads, the line became part of the [[Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad]]. A line connecting it to the east reached Kokomo on January 1, 1881.<ref>Railroads, pp. 419\u201320.</ref>\n\n===Mayor Cole===\nIn 1881, one of the most remarkable and controversial events in Kokomo's history took place. Mayor Henry C. Cole was shot to death by a sheriff's posse. Dr. Cole had a curious history and had stirred up a great deal of passion in the previous fifteen years. He was reputed to have been a gifted surgeon, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War and when afterwards he settled in Kokomo, he became a prominent physician.

In March 1886, a group of citizens, led principally by A.Y. Comstock (who had promoted the [[Frankfort and Kokomo Railroad]]) and D.C. Spraker (later President of Kokomo Rubber Company), circulated a memorandum seeking subscribers (at $100 each) for the purpose of boring for gas at a distance of at least {{convert|2000|ft}} below ground. It took until September to obtain the necessary 22 subscribers.

White was a teenage hemophiliac who had been infected with [[HIV]] through contaminated blood products (Factor 8). At the time blood products were often collected through state prison systems. Factor 8 was made from pooled plasma of thousands of donors. Later the plasma was screened for HIV and Hepatitis and heat treated to inactive HIV and Hepatitis. The teen had been attending [[Western School Corporation|Western Middle School]] (which is actually in [[Russiaville, Indiana|Russiaville]]) but was ostracized by his classmates, and forced to eat lunch alone and use a separate restroom. Many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied in support of banning White from attending the school. A lengthy administrative appeal process with the school system ensued, followed by death threats and violence against White and his family, including a bullet being fired through the window of their Kokomo home. Media coverage of the case made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCMr9jbq3Tk|title=AIDS Boy Banned From Attending School - 1st August 1985|first=|last=CampaignTB|date=November 2, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=August 18, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 1987, the White family left Kokomo for [[Cicero, Indiana]]. Ryan attended [[Hamilton Heights School Corporation|Hamilton Heights High School]] in nearby Arcadia, where he was welcomed by faculty and students.\n\n===Gas tower===\nThe Kokomo Gas Tower had been a symbol of Kokomo since it was constructed in 1954. The tower was {{convert|378|ft}} tall and had a capacity of {{convert|12000000|cuft}}. Due to high maintenance costs of $75,000 a year, and up to $1,000,000 to paint it, the gas company decided to demolish it in 2003. Other ideas were reviewed before settling on this decision, including a plan to turn the tower into a giant [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement. On September 7, 2003, at approximately 7:30&nbsp;a.m., the Gas Tower was demolished by [[Controlled Demolition, Inc.]] (CDI). Pieces of the tower were sold to the public for $20\u201330, and proceeds went to a planned Kokomo technology incubation center and [[Bona Vista (charity)|Bona Vista]].<ref>{{Cite news\n | title = Crowds flooded the intersection of Firmin and Home Avenue\n | newspaper = Kokomo Tribune\n | url = http://kokomotribune.com/archive/x518862403 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120308200658/http://kokomotribune.com/archive/x518862403 | url-status = dead | archive-date = March 8, 2012 | date = December 16, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2016 Tornado ===\n{{Main|2016 Kokomo tornado}}\nOn August 24, 2016 a strong EF3 tornado caused major damage in the southern part of Kokomo. 1,000 homes were damaged, 170 of which sustained major damage. 80 of these homes were destroyed, some sustaining loss of roofs and exterior walls.

The first tornado was rated F0 and caused little damage to homes and trees. The second tornado was rated F1 and caused a roof to collapse at the local skating rink, and damaged three other homes and a truck stop. Both tornadoes caused 1 injury and no fatalities.

Manufacturing operations in the steel plant and on other portions of the property included the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Steel-making operations had included reheating, casting rolling, drawing, pickling, galvanizing, tinning and tempering.\n\nAfter the company filed for bankruptcy in 1986, EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management investigated the plant and property and found soil, sediments, surface water and ground water contaminated with volatile organic compounds (PCBs) and several metals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Lead contamination was also detected in soils on nearby residential properties.\n\nThe site was proposed to the [[National Priorities List]] as a [[Superfund]] site in 1988 and formally added in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Indiana Superfund sites\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/query/queryhtm/nplfin.htm#IN\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, EPA received almost $6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to complete needed cleanup at two problems at the Continental Steel Superfund site: the former Slag Processing Area and the site's contaminated ground water. The ARRA funding helped accelerate the cleanup of hazardous waste on the site. In the process, total of 15 Indiana contractors or subcontractors were involved in the ARRA-funded work, creating at least 45 temporary jobs.\n\nIn August 2010, using the ARRA funds, EPA completed the cleanup of the former slag processing area of the Superfund Site. Approximately {{convert|86000|short ton}} of slag were moved to the site's acid lagoon area for use as fill on that portion of the site. {{convert|2|ft|m|1|spell=In}} of clean soil were used to cap the former slag processing area, leaving it suitable for potential redevelopment. ARRA funds were also used to address contaminated groundwater at the site. This work included extensive groundwater sampling to determine the contaminated plume area and installation of groundwater extraction and monitoring wells. Three wind turbines will be used to generate much of the power needed to operate the groundwater extraction system.\n\nSite cleanup was completed in August 2011.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Region 5 Cleanup Sites, Continental Steel Corp.\n | url = http://www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/continental/\n | access-date = August 31, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 the former site was approved as the location of a [[Solar farm]] with installation of panels beginning in August 2016.

Some of these potential sources are currently being managed under other authorities but there is no cleanup approach focusing on the ground water plume.
