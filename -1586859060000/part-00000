The series follows [[Eve Polastri]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] investigator tasked with capturing psychopathic assassin [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]] ([[Jodie Comer]]); as the chase progresses, the two [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|develop a mutual obsession]]. Based on the ''[[Codename Villanelle|Villanelle]]'' novel series by [[Luke Jennings]], each of the show's series has featured a different female [[showrunner]]. [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]] was head writer of the first series, while [[Emerald Fennell]] took over for the second series. Suzanne Heathcote will serve as showrunner for the third series.\n\nThe show has been highly successful in both the United States and the United Kingdom, receiving critical acclaim for both the first and second series, particularly for its writing and the lead actresses' performances. The first series had unbroken weekly ratings increases, among adults especially. It has received several accolades, including a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]]. Both Oh and Comer have won multiple Best Actress awards for their roles, with [[Fiona Shaw]] winning one for Best Supporting Actress as Carolyn Martens.\n\nBy January 2020, ''Killing Eve'' had been renewed for both a third and a fourth series.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite web |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |title=''Killing Eve'' Renewed for Season 3 |url=https://tvline.com/2019/04/08/killing-eve-renewed-season-3/ |website=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=8 April 2019 |location=United States |date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/03/killing-eve-renewed-season-4/|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=3 January 2020|title=Killing Eve renewed for season 4|last=Snierson|first=Dan}}</ref> The third series premiered on 12 April 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\nBored with her protection role within the British intelligence agencies, [[Eve Polastri]] is overly interested with female assassins, their psychologies, and their methods of killing. After brashly investigating behind-the-scenes in relation to a witness she is handling, she is fired from [[MI5]]; however, to her delight, she is recruited by a secret division within [[MI6]] chasing an international assassin who calls herself [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]]. Eve crosses paths with Villanelle and discovers that members within both of their secret circles may be more interconnected than she is comfortable with, but forms [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|an obsession with Villanelle that is more enthusiastically reciprocated]].

television series, produced in the United Kingdom by Sid Gentle Films for [[BBC America]]. The series follows [[Eve Polastri]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] investigator tasked with capturing psychopathic assassin [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]] ([[Jodie Comer]]); as the chase progresses, the two [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|develop a mutual obsession]]. Based on the ''[[Codename Villanelle|Villanelle]]'' novel series by [[Luke Jennings]], each of the show's series has featured a different female [[showrunner]]. [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]] was head writer of the first series, while [[Emerald Fennell]] took over for the second series. Suzanne Heathcote will serve as showrunner for the third series.\n\nThe show has been highly successful in both the United States and the United Kingdom, receiving critical acclaim for both the first and second series, particularly for its writing and the lead actresses' performances. The first series had unbroken weekly ratings increases, among adults especially. It has received several accolades, including a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]]. Both Oh and Comer have won multiple Best Actress awards for their roles, with [[Fiona Shaw]] winning one for Best Supporting Actress as Carolyn Martens.\n\nBy January 2020, ''Killing Eve'' had been renewed for both a third and a fourth series.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite web |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |title=''Killing Eve'' Renewed for Season 3 |url=https://tvline.com/2019/04/08/killing-eve-renewed-season-3/ |website=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=8 April 2019 |location=United States |date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/03/killing-eve-renewed-season-4/|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=3 January 2020|title=Killing Eve renewed for season 4|last=Snierson|first=Dan}}</ref> The third series premiered on 12 April 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\nBored with her protection role within the British intelligence agencies, [[Eve Polastri]] is overly interested with female assassins, their psychologies, and their methods of killing. After brashly investigating behind-the-scenes in relation to a witness she is handling, she is fired from [[MI5]]; however, to her delight, she is recruited by a secret division within [[MI6]] chasing an international assassin who calls herself [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]]. Eve crosses paths with Villanelle and discovers that members within both of their secret circles may be more interconnected than she is comfortable with, but forms [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|an obsession with Villanelle that is more enthusiastically reciprocated]]. Both women begin to focus less on their initial missions in order to desperately seek more about the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/killing-eve/about|title=About the Show|website=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as [[Eve Polastri]], an agent with [[MI5]] (the UK's domestic [[counter-intelligence]] and security agency) who becomes obsessed with a notorious assassin and is recruited on an off-the-books basis to the foreign [[intelligence agency]] [[MI6]].\n* [[Jodie Comer]] as [[Villanelle (character)|Oksana Astankova / Villanelle]], a psychopathic, skilled assassin who becomes obsessed with the MI5 officer who is tracking her.\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Carolyn Martens, head of the Russia Section at [[MI6]].\n* [[Kim Bodnia]] as Konstantin Vasiliev, Villanelle's handler.\n* [[Owen McDonnell]] as Niko Polastri, Eve's English-Polish husband, a teacher.\n* Sean Delaney as Kenny Stowton, Carolyn's son, an ex-hacker who has been recruited by MI6.

This facility was then the second largest hog-packing plant in North America.]]\nThe '''meat packing industry''' handles the [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughtering]], [[Food processing|processing]], [[packaging]],  and distribution of [[meat]] from animals such  as [[cattle]], [[pigs]], [[sheep]] and other [[livestock]]. [[Poultry]] is generally not included. This greater part of the entire [[meat industry]] is primarily focused on producing meat for [[meat consumption|human consumption]], but it also yields a variety of [[by-product]]s including [[Hide (skin)|hides]], [[feather]]s, dried blood, and, through the process of [[rendering (industrial)|rendering]], [[fat]] such as [[tallow]] and [[protein]] meals such as [[meat & bone meal]].\n\nIn the United States and some other countries, the facility where the meat packing is done is called a ''[[slaughterhouse]]'', ''packinghouse'' or a ''meat packing plant''; in [[New Zealand]], where most of the products are exported, it is called a ''freezing works''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.noted.co.nz/life/life-in-nz/abandoned-freezing-works-new-zealand-following-the-call/|title=Following the call of New Zealand's abandoned freezing works|last=Noted|website=Noted|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> An [[abattoir]] is a place where animals are slaughtered for food.\n\n[[File:Pork packing in Cincinnati 1873.jpg|thumb|Pork packing in Cincinnati, 1873]]\nThe meat packing industry grew with the construction of the railroads and methods of [[refrigeration]] for [[meat preservation]]. Railroads made possible the transport of stock to central points for processing, and the transport of products.\n\n== History ==\n===  United States ===\nBefore the Civil War, the [[meat industry]] was localized, with nearby farmers providing beef and hogs for local butchers to serve the local market. Large Army contracts during the war attracted entrepreneurs with a vision for building much larger markets. The 1865\u20131873 era provided five factors that nationalized the industry: \n\n* The rapid growth of cities provided a lucrative new market for fresh meat. \n\n* The emergence of large-scale ranching, the role of the railroads, refrigeration, and entrepreneurial skills.  \n\n* Cattle ranching on a large-scale moved to the Great Plains, from Texas northward.\n\n* Overland cattle drives moved large herds to the railheads in Kansas, where cattle cars brought live animals eastward.  \n\n* Abilene, Kansas, became the chief railhead, shipping 35,000 cattle a year, mostly to Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago. \n\nIn Milwaukee, [[Philip Armour]], an ambitious entrepreneur from New York who made his fortune in Army contracts during the war, partnered with Jacob Plankinton to build a highly efficient stockyard that serviced the upper Midwest. Chicago built the famous Union Stockyards in 1865 on 345 swampy acres to the south of downtown. Armour opened the Chicago plant, as did Nelson Morris, another wartime contractor. Cincinnati and Buffalo, both with good water and rail service, also opened stockyards.  Perhaps the most energetic entrepreneur was [[Gustavus Franklin Swift]], the Yankee who operated out of Boston and moved to Chicago in 1875, specializing in long distance refrigerated meat shipments to eastern cities.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''The emergence of modern America, 1865-1878'' (1927) pp 35-39.</ref> \n\nA practical refrigerated (ice cooled) rail car was introduced in 1881. This made it possible to ship cattle and hog carcasses, which weighed only 40% as much as live animals; the entire national market, served by the railroads, was opened up, as well as transatlantic markets using refrigerated ships. Swift developed an integrated network of cattle procurement, slaughtering, meat-packing and shipping meat to market. Up to that time cattle were driven great distances to railroad shipping points, causing the cattle to lose considerable weight. Swift developed a large business, which grew in size with the entry of several competitors.<ref> Alfred D. Chandler, ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise'' (1962). pp 25-28 </ref>\n\nThe [[Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]] was the first of a series of legislation that led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).  Another such act passed the same year was the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]].  The new laws helped the large packers, and hurt small operations that lacked economy of scale or quality controls.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roots|first=Roger|date=2001-01-01|title=A Muckraker's Aftermath: The Jungle of Meat-packing Regulation after a Century|url=https://open.mitchellhamline.edu/wmlr/vol27/iss4/1|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|volume=27|issue=4|issn=0270-272X}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[ William Cronon]]  concludes:\n:Because of the Chicago packers, ranchers in Wyoming and feedlot farmers in Iowa regularly found a reliable market for their animals, and on average received better prices for the animals they sold there. At the same time and for the same reason, Americans of all classes found a greater variety of more and better meats on their tables, purchased on average at lower prices than ever before. Seen in this light, the packers' \"rigid system of economy\" seemed a very good thing indeed.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Cronon|title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OCQAwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=254|isbn=9780393072457}}</ref>\n\n====Labor issues====\n{{see also|The Jungle#Federal response}}\nIn the early part of the 19th century, they used the most recent immigrants and migrants as strikebreakers in labor actions taken by other workers, also usually immigrants or early descendants. The publication of the [[Upton Sinclair]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' in the U.S. in 1906, shocked the public with the poor working conditions and unsanitary practices in meat packing plants in the United States, specifically [[Chicago]].\n\nMeat packing plants, like many industries in the early 20th century, were known to overwork their employees, failed to maintain adequate safety measures, and actively fought unionization. Public pressure to [[U.S. Congress]] led to the passage of the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], both passed in 1906 on the same day to ensure better regulations of the meat packing industry as well as better treatment of its employees working there. Before the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], workers were exposed to dangerous chemicals, sharp machinery, and horrible injuries. \n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, workers achieved unionization under the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]'s [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] (UPWA). An interracial committee led the organizing in [[Chicago]], where the majority of workers in the industry were black, and other major cities, such as [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where they were an important minority in the industry. UPWA workers made important gains in wages, hours and benefits. In 1957 the stockyards and meat packing employed half the workers of Omaha. The union supported a progressive agenda, including the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s. While the work was still difficult, for a few decades workers achieved [[blue-collar]], middle-class lives from it.\n\nThough the meat packing industry has made many improvements since the early 1900s, extensive changes in the industry since the late 20th century have caused new labor issues to arise. Today, the rate of injury in the meat packing industry is three times that of private industry overall, and meat packing was noted by [[Human Rights Watch]] as being \"the most dangerous factory job in America\". The meatpacking industry continues to employ many immigrant laborers, including some who are [[undocumented worker]]s. In the early 20th century the workers were immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, and black migrants from the South. Today many are Hispanic, from Mexico, Central and South America. Many are from Peru, leading to the formation of a large Peruvian community. The more isolated areas in which the plants are located put workers at greater risk due to their limited ability to organize and to seek redress for work-related injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/business/meat-packing-industry-criticized-on-human-rights-grounds.html|title=Meat Packing Industry Criticized on Human Rights Grounds|date=2005-01-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/1.htm|title=Blood, Sweat, and Fear|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/opinion/13sun2.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Shame of Postville, Iowa|date=2008-07-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n====Changing geography====\nThe industry after 1945 closed its stockyards in big cities like Chicago and moved operations to small towns close to cattle ranches, especially in Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado.   Historically, besides Cincinnati, Chicago and Omaha, the other major meat packing cities had been  [[South St. Paul, Minnesota]]; [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]; [[Dubuque, Iowa]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Austin, Minnesota]]; [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]; and [[Sioux City, Iowa]].  \n\n====Rail to truck====\nMid-century restructuring by the industry of the stockyards, slaughterhouses and meat packing led to relocating facilities closer to cattle feedlots and swine production facilities, to more rural areas, as transportation shifted from rail to truck. It has been difficult for labor to organize in such locations. In addition, the number of jobs fell sharply due to technology and other changes. Wages fell during the latter part of the 20th century, and eventually, both Chicago (in 1971) and Omaha (in 1999) closed their stockyards. The work force increasingly relied on recent migrants from Mexico.\n\n==Argentina==\nArgentina had the natural resources and human talent to build a world-class meat-packing industry.  However its success in reaching European markets was limited by the poor quality control in the production of their meat and the general inferiority of frozen meat to the chilled meat exported by the United States and Australia, By 1900, the Argentine government encouraged investment in the industry to improve quality. The British dominated the world shipping industry, and  began fitting  their ships for cold air containers, and built new refrigerated steamers. When the Argentine industry finally secured a large slice of the British market, [[Foot-and-mouth disease|Pateros]] and trade restrictions limited its penetration of the Continent.  <ref>Robert Greenhill, \"Shipping and the Refrigerated Meat Trade from the River Plate, 1900\u20131930.\" ''International Journal of Maritime History'' 4.1 (1992): 65-82.</ref>\n\n==China==\nMeat in China moved from a minor specialty commodity to a major factor in the food supply in the late 20th century thanks to the rapid emergence of a middle-class with upscale tastes and plenty of money. It was a transition from a small ration of meat only for urban citizens to the world's largest meat-producer; it was a movement from a handful of processing facilities in major cities to thousands of modern meat packing and processing plants throughout the country. With the rapid growth of a middle-class with spending money,<ref>Guanghong Zhou,  Wangang Zhang, and Xinglian Xu. \"China's meat industry revolution: Challenges and opportunities for the future.\" ''Meat science'' 92.3 (2012): 188-196. </ref>\n\n== Negative effects on meat packers ==\n{{further|Labor rights in American meatpacking industry}}\nAmerican slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker.<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/meatpacking/index.html |title=Meatpacking |website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration |access-date=23 May 2019}} </ref> [[NPR]] reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average.<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/11/489468205/working-the-chain-slaughterhouse-workers-face-lifelong-injuries |title=Working 'The Chain,' Slaughterhouse Workers Face Lifelong Injuries |last=Lowe  |first=Peggy |date=11 August 2016 |website=National Public Radio |access-date=23 May 2019}} </ref> [[The Guardian]] reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the [[United States]].<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant |title=Two amputations a week: the cost of working in a US meat plant  |date=5 July 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=23 May 2019}} </ref> On average, one employee of [[Tyson Foods]], the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month.<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/coralewis/americas-largest-meat-producer-one-amputation-per-month#.pxxm3zY5Z |title=America's Largest Meat Producer Averages One Amputation Per Month |last=Lewis  |first=Cora |date=18 February 2018 |website=Buzzfeed News |access-date=23 May 2019}} </ref> The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years, in the [[UK]] 78 slaughter workers lost fingers, parts of fingers or limbs, more than 800 workers had serious injuries, and at least 4,500 had to take more than three days off after accidents.<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-07-29/uk-meat-plant-injuries |title=Revealed: Shocking safety record of UK meat plants |date=29 July 2018 |website=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism  |access-date=23 May 2019}} </ref> In a 2018 study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed.<ref> {{cite journal |last1=Francesca Iulietto |first1=Maria |last2=Sechi |first2=Paola |date=3 July 2018 |title=Noise assessment in slaughterhouses by means of a smartphone app |journal=Italian Journal of Food Safety |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=7053 |doi=10.4081/ijfs.2018.7053 |pmid=30046554 |pmc=6036995 }} </ref> A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that \"excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes, all cancers, and lung cancer\" in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry.<ref> {{cite journal |last1=McLean |first1=D |last2=Cheng |first2=S |date=June 2004 |title=Mortality and cancer incidence in New Zealand meat workers |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=541\u2013547 |doi=10.1136/oem.2003.010587 |pmid=15150395 |pmc=1763658 }} </ref> \n\t \n{{Cquote|The worst thing, worse than the physical danger, is the emotional toll.

Railroads made possible the transport of stock to central points for processing, and the transport of products.\n\n== History ==\n===  United States ===\nBefore the Civil War, the [[meat industry]] was localized, with nearby farmers providing beef and hogs for local butchers to serve the local market. Large Army contracts during the war attracted entrepreneurs with a vision for building much larger markets. The 1865\u20131873 era provided five factors that nationalized the industry: \n\n* The rapid growth of cities provided a lucrative new market for fresh meat. \n\n* The emergence of large-scale ranching, the role of the railroads, refrigeration, and entrepreneurial skills.  \n\n* Cattle ranching on a large-scale moved to the Great Plains, from Texas northward.\n\n* Overland cattle drives moved large herds to the railheads in Kansas, where cattle cars brought live animals eastward.  \n\n* Abilene, Kansas, became the chief railhead, shipping 35,000 cattle a year, mostly to Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago. \n\nIn Milwaukee, [[Philip Armour]], an ambitious entrepreneur from New York who made his fortune in Army contracts during the war, partnered with Jacob Plankinton to build a highly efficient stockyard that serviced the upper Midwest. Chicago built the famous Union Stockyards in 1865 on 345 swampy acres to the south of downtown. Armour opened the Chicago plant, as did Nelson Morris, another wartime contractor. Cincinnati and Buffalo, both with good water and rail service, also opened stockyards.  Perhaps the most energetic entrepreneur was [[Gustavus Franklin Swift]], the Yankee who operated out of Boston and moved to Chicago in 1875, specializing in long distance refrigerated meat shipments to eastern cities.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''The emergence of modern America, 1865-1878'' (1927) pp 35-39.</ref> \n\nA practical refrigerated (ice cooled) rail car was introduced in 1881. This made it possible to ship cattle and hog carcasses, which weighed only 40% as much as live animals; the entire national market, served by the railroads, was opened up, as well as transatlantic markets using refrigerated ships. Swift developed an integrated network of cattle procurement, slaughtering, meat-packing and shipping meat to market. Up to that time cattle were driven great distances to railroad shipping points, causing the cattle to lose considerable weight. Swift developed a large business, which grew in size with the entry of several competitors.<ref> Alfred D. Chandler, ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise'' (1962). pp 25-28 </ref>\n\nThe [[Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]] was the first of a series of legislation that led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).  Another such act passed the same year was the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]].  The new laws helped the large packers, and hurt small operations that lacked economy of scale or quality controls.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roots|first=Roger|date=2001-01-01|title=A Muckraker's Aftermath: The Jungle of Meat-packing Regulation after a Century|url=https://open.mitchellhamline.edu/wmlr/vol27/iss4/1|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|volume=27|issue=4|issn=0270-272X}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[ William Cronon]]  concludes:\n:Because of the Chicago packers, ranchers in Wyoming and feedlot farmers in Iowa regularly found a reliable market for their animals, and on average received better prices for the animals they sold there. At the same time and for the same reason, Americans of all classes found a greater variety of more and better meats on their tables, purchased on average at lower prices than ever before. Seen in this light, the packers' \"rigid system of economy\" seemed a very good thing indeed.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Cronon|title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OCQAwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=W.

The publication of the [[Upton Sinclair]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' in the U.S. in 1906, shocked the public with the poor working conditions and unsanitary practices in meat packing plants in the United States, specifically [[Chicago]].\n\nMeat packing plants, like many industries in the early 20th century, were known to overwork their employees, failed to maintain adequate safety measures, and actively fought unionization. Public pressure to [[U.S. Congress]] led to the passage of the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], both passed in 1906 on the same day to ensure better regulations of the meat packing industry as well as better treatment of its employees working there. Before the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], workers were exposed to dangerous chemicals, sharp machinery, and horrible injuries. \n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, workers achieved unionization under the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]'s [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] (UPWA). An interracial committee led the organizing in [[Chicago]], where the majority of workers in the industry were black, and other major cities, such as [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where they were an important minority in the industry. UPWA workers made important gains in wages, hours and benefits. In 1957 the stockyards and meat packing employed half the workers of Omaha. The union supported a progressive agenda, including the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s. While the work was still difficult, for a few decades workers achieved [[blue-collar]], middle-class lives from it.\n\nThough the meat packing industry has made many improvements since the early 1900s, extensive changes in the industry since the late 20th century have caused new labor issues to arise. Today, the rate of injury in the meat packing industry is three times that of private industry overall, and meat packing was noted by [[Human Rights Watch]] as being \"the most dangerous factory job in America\". The meatpacking industry continues to employ many immigrant laborers, including some who are [[undocumented worker]]s. In the early 20th century the workers were immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, and black migrants from the South. Today many are Hispanic, from Mexico, Central and South America. Many are from Peru, leading to the formation of a large Peruvian community. The more isolated areas in which the plants are located put workers at greater risk due to their limited ability to organize and to seek redress for work-related injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/business/meat-packing-industry-criticized-on-human-rights-grounds.html|title=Meat Packing Industry Criticized on Human Rights Grounds|date=2005-01-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/1.htm|title=Blood, Sweat, and Fear|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/opinion/13sun2.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Shame of Postville, Iowa|date=2008-07-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n====Changing geography====\nThe industry after 1945 closed its stockyards in big cities like Chicago and moved operations to small towns close to cattle ranches, especially in Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado.   Historically, besides Cincinnati, Chicago and Omaha, the other major meat packing cities had been  [[South St. Paul, Minnesota]]; [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]; [[Dubuque, Iowa]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Austin, Minnesota]]; [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]; and [[Sioux City, Iowa]].  \n\n====Rail to truck====\nMid-century restructuring by the industry of the stockyards, slaughterhouses and meat packing led to relocating facilities closer to cattle feedlots and swine production facilities, to more rural areas, as transportation shifted from rail to truck. It has been difficult for labor to organize in such locations. In addition, the number of jobs fell sharply due to technology and other changes. Wages fell during the latter part of the 20th century, and eventually, both Chicago (in 1971) and Omaha (in 1999) closed their stockyards. The work force increasingly relied on recent migrants from Mexico.\n\n==Argentina==\nArgentina had the natural resources and human talent to build a world-class meat-packing industry.  However its success in reaching European markets was limited by the poor quality control in the production of their meat and the general inferiority of frozen meat to the chilled meat exported by the United States and Australia, By 1900, the Argentine government encouraged investment in the industry to improve quality. The British dominated the world shipping industry, and  began fitting  their ships for cold air containers, and built new refrigerated steamers. When the Argentine industry finally secured a large slice of the British market, [[Foot-and-mouth disease|Pateros]] and trade restrictions limited its penetration of the Continent.  <ref>Robert Greenhill, \"Shipping and the Refrigerated Meat Trade from the River Plate, 1900\u20131930.\" ''International Journal of Maritime History'' 4.1 (1992): 65-82.</ref>\n\n==China==\nMeat in China moved from a minor specialty commodity to a major factor in the food supply in the late 20th century thanks to the rapid emergence of a middle-class with upscale tastes and plenty of money. It was a transition from a small ration of meat only for urban citizens to the world's largest meat-producer; it was a movement from a handful of processing facilities in major cities to thousands of modern meat packing and processing plants throughout the country.

{"title_page": "Thirty-nine Articles", "text_new": "{{short description|Doctrinal statement of the Church of England and other Anglican churches}}\n{{Redirect|King's Book||Book of Kings (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Anglicanism}}\n\nThe '''Thirty-nine Articles of Religion''' (commonly abbreviated as the '''Thirty-nine Articles''' or the '''XXXIX Articles''') are the historically defining statements of doctrines and practices of the [[Church of England]] with respect to the controversies of the [[English Reformation]].  The Thirty-nine Articles form part of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' used by both the Church of England and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nWhen [[Henry VIII]] broke with the Catholic Church and was [[excommunication|excommunicated]], he began the reform of the Church of England, which would be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|headed]] by the monarch (himself) rather than the pope. At this point, he needed to determine what its doctrines and practices would be in relation to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the new [[Protestantism|Protestant movements]] in continental Europe. A series of defining documents were written and replaced over a period of 30 years as the doctrinal and political situation changed from the excommunication of Henry VIII in 1533, to the [[excommunication of Elizabeth I]] in 1570.  These positions began with the Ten Articles in 1536, and concluded with the finalisation of the Thirty-nine articles in 1571. The Thirty-nine articles ultimately served to define the doctrine of the Church of England as it related to [[Calvinist]] doctrine and Roman Catholic practice.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe articles went through at least five major revisions prior to their finalisation in 1571. The first attempt was the Ten Articles in 1536, which showed some slightly Protestant leanings \u2013 the result of an English desire for a political alliance with the German [[Lutheran]] princes.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} The next revision was the Six Articles in 1539 which swung away from all reformed positions,{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} and then the ''King's Book'' in 1543, which re-established most of the earlier Roman Catholic doctrines. During the reign of [[Edward VI]], Henry VIII's only son, the Forty-two Articles were written under the direction of [[Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1552. It was in this document that Calvinist thought reached the zenith of its influence in the English Church. These articles were never put into action, due to Edward VI's death and the reversion of the English Church to Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII's elder daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nFinally, upon the coronation of Elizabeth I and the re-establishment of the Church of England as separate from the Roman Catholic Church, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion were initiated by the [[Convocation of 1563]], under the direction of [[Matthew Parker]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The articles pulled back from some of the more extreme Calvinist thinking and created the distinctive English reformed doctrine.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were finalised in 1571, and incorporated into the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although not the end of the struggle between Catholic and Protestant monarchs and citizens, the book helped to standardise the English language, and was to have a lasting effect on [[religion in the United Kingdom]] and elsewhere through its wide use.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1999|p=}}\n\n==Predecessors==\n===Ten Articles (1536)===\nThe [[Church of England]]'s break with Rome inaugurated a period of doctrinal confusion and controversy as both conservative and reforming clergy attempted to shape the church's direction, the former as \"[[Catholicism]] without the [[Pope]]\" and the latter as [[Protestant]]. In an attempt \"to establish Christian quietness and unity\", the Ten Articles were adopted by clerical [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Convocation]] in July 1536 as the English Church's first post-papal doctrinal statement.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}} The Ten Articles were crafted as a rushed interim compromise between conservatives and reformers. Historians have variously described it as a victory for [[Lutheranism]] and a success for Catholic resistance.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 128}} Its provisions have also been described as \"confusing\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nThe first five articles dealt with doctrines that were \"commanded expressly by God, and are necessary to our [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]\", while the last five articles dealt with \"laudable ceremonies used in the Church\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} This division reflects how the Articles originated from two different discussions earlier in the year. The first five articles were based on the Wittenberg Articles negotiated between English ambassadors [[Edward Foxe]], [[Nicholas Heath]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] and German Lutheran theologians, including [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]]. This doctrinal statement was itself based on the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530.{{Sfn | \"Wittenberg Articles\"}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}}\n\nThe five principal doctrines were the [[Bible]] and [[ecumenical creeds]], [[baptism]], [[penance]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Justification (theology)|justification]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} The core doctrine in the Ten Articles was [[justification by faith]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}} Justification \u2013 which was defined as [[Forgiveness|remission]] of [[sin]] and accepting into God's favour \u2013 was through \"the only mercy and [[Grace in Christianity|grace]] of the [[God the Father|Father]], promised freely unto us for his Son\u2019s sake [[Jesus Christ]], and the merits of his [[Blood of Christ|blood]] and [[Passion of Jesus|passion]]\".{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} [[Good works]] would follow, not precede, justification. However, the Lutheran influence was diluted with qualifications. Justification was attained \"by [[Contrition|contrition]] and [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] joined with [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}}  In other words, good works were \"necessarily required to the attaining of everlasting life\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nTo the disappointment of conservatives, only three of the traditional seven [[sacrament]]s were even mentioned (baptism, the Eucharist and penance).{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} The Articles affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], stating that \"under the form and figure of bread and wine ... is verily, substantially and really contained the very self-same body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} This definition was acceptable to those who held to [[transubstantiation]] or [[sacramental union]], but it clearly condemned [[sacramentarianism]]. More controversially for the reformers, the Articles maintained penance as a sacrament and the [[priest]]'s authority to grant divine [[absolution]] in [[Confession (religion)|confession]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nArticles six through ten focused on secondary issues. Significantly, [[purgatory]], which had been a central concern of medieval religion, was placed in the non-essential articles. On the question of its existence, the Ten Articles were ambiguous. It stated, \"the place where [departed souls] be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there\" was \"uncertain by scripture\". [[Prayer for the dead]] and [[Requiem|masses for the dead]] were permitted as possibly relieving the pain of departed souls in purgatory.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 240}} \n\nThe Articles also defended the use of a number of Catholic rituals and practices opposed by Protestants, such as kissing the cross on [[Good Friday]], while mildly criticizing popular abuses and excesses. The use of [[Religious images in Christian theology|religious images]] was permitted, but people were to be taught not to kneel before them or make [[Votive offering|offerings]] to them. Prayer to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], and all the other [[saint]]s was permitted as long as [[superstition]] was avoided.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 238\u2013239}} \n\nIn summary, the Ten Articles asserted:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | title = Ten Articles 1536 | website = reformationhenryviii.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180803183730/http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | archive-date = August 3, 2018 | url-status = live | access-date = August 3, 2018 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n# The Bible and the three ecumenical creeds are the basis and summary of true Christian faith.\n# Baptism imparts [[Forgiveness|remission of sins]] and [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and is necessary for salvation, even in the case of infants. It condemns the opinions of [[Anabaptist]]s and [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] as [[heresy]]. \n# The sacrament of penance, with confession and absolution, is necessary to salvation.\n# That the body and blood of Christ are really present in the Eucharist.\n# Justification is by faith, but good works are necessary.\n# Images can be used as representations of virtue and good example and also to remind people of their sins but are not objects of worship.\n# Saints are to be honored as examples of life and as furthering the prayers of the faithful.\n# [[Intercession of saints|Praying to saints]] is permitted, and holy days should be observed.\n# The observance of various rites and ceremonies, such as clerical [[vestment]]s, sprinkling of [[holy water]], bearing of candles on [[Candlemas]], giving of ashes on [[Ash Wednesday]], is good and laudable. However, none of these has power to forgive sin. \n# It is a good and charitable deed to pray for the dead. However, the doctrine of purgatory is biblically uncertain. Abuses related to purgatory, such as the claim that papal [[indulgence]]s or masses for the dead offered at certain localities (such as the ''[[Santa Maria Scala Coeli|scala coeli]]'' mass) can deliver immediately from purgatory, are to be rejected.\n\n=== ''Bishops' Book'' (1537) ===\n\n[[Image:Thomas-Cranmer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Cranmer]] headed the committee that authored the ''Bishop's Book''.]]\n\nThe failure of the Ten Articles to settle doctrinal controversy led [[Thomas Cromwell]], the King's [[vicegerent]] in spirituals, to convene a national [[synod]] of bishops and high-ranking clergy for further theological discussion in February 1537.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=185\u2013186}} This synod produced a book called ''The Institution of the Christian Man'' (popularly called ''The Bishops' Book''), the word ''institution'' being synonymous with ''instruction''.{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 444}} ''The Bishops' Book'' preserved the semi-Lutheranism of the Ten Articles, and the articles on justification, purgatory, and the sacraments of baptism, the Eucharist and penance were incorporated unchanged into the new book.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 255}}\n \nWhen the synod met, conservatives were still angry that four of the traditional seven sacraments ([[confirmation]], marriage, [[holy orders]] and [[extreme unction]]) had been excluded from the Ten Articles. [[John Stokesley]] argued for all seven, while [[Thomas Cranmer]] only acknowledged baptism and the Eucharist. The others divided along party lines. The conservatives were at a disadvantage because they found it necessary to appeal to [[sacred tradition]], which violated Cromwell's instructions that all arguments refer to scripture.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=187\u2013188}} \n\nIn the end, the missing sacraments were restored but placed in a separate section to emphasize \"a difference in dignity and necessity.\" Only baptism, the Eucharist and penance were \"instituted of Christ, to be as certain instruments or remedies necessary for our salvation\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 254}} Confirmation was declared to have been introduced by the [[early Church]] in imitation of what they had read about the [[Christian laying on of hands|practice of the Apostles]].{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=189}} \n\nThe ''Bishops' Book'' also included expositions on the creed, the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Lord's Prayer]] and [[Hail Mary]].{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 446}} These were greatly influenced by [[William Marshall (translator)|William Marshall]]'s primer (lay [[Christian devotional literature|devotional]] book) of 1535, which itself was influenced by Luther's writings.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Following Marshall, ''The Bishops' Book'' rejected the traditional Catholic numbering of the Ten Commandments, in which the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|prohibition on making and worshiping graven images]] was part of the first commandment, \"[[Thou shalt have no other gods before me]]\". In agreement with the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]]'s church at Zurich, the authors of the ''Bishops' Book'' adopted the Jewish tradition of separating these commandments. While allowing images of Christ and the saints, the exposition on the second commandment taught against representations of [[God the Father]] and criticised those who \"be more ready with their substance to deck dead images gorgeously and gloriously, than with the same to help poor Christian people, the quick and lively [[Image of God|images of God]]\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Such teachings encouraged [[iconoclasm]], which would become a feature of the English Reformation.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=192}} \n\nThe list of the 46 divines as they appear in the ''Bishop's Book'' included all of the [[bishop]]s, eight [[archdeacon]]s and 17 other [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]], some of whom were later involved with translating the [[Great Bible|Bible]] and compiling the [[The Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]:{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 445}}\n\n[[Thomas Cranmer]] \u2013\n[[Edward Lee, Archbishop of York|Edward Lee]] \u2013\n[[John Stokesley]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Tunstall]] \u2013\n[[Stephen Gardiner]] \u2013\n[[Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle|Robert Aldrich]] \u2013\n[[John Voysey]] \u2013\n[[John Longland]] \u2013\n[[John Clerk, Bishop of Bath and Wells|John Clerk]] \u2013\n[[Rowland Lee]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Goodrich]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Shaxton]] \u2013\n[[John Bird (Bishop)|John Bird]] \u2013\n[[Edward Foxe]] \u2013\n[[Hugh Latimer]] \u2013\n[[John Hilsey]] \u2013\n[[Richard Sampson]] \u2013\n[[William Repps]] \u2013\n[[William Barlowe]] \u2013\n[[Robert Partew]] \u2013\n[[Robert Holgate]] \u2013\n[[Richard Wolman]] \u2013\n[[William Knight (royal servant)|William Knight]] \u2013\n[[John Bell, Bishop of Worcester|John Bell]] \u2013\n[[Edmund Bonner|Edmond Bonner]] \u2013\n[[William Skip]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Heath]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Marshal]] \u2013\n[[Richard Curren]] \u2013\n[[William Cliffe]] \u2013\n[[William Downes (divine)|William Downes]] \u2013\n[[Robert Oking]] \u2013\n[[Ralph Bradford]] \u2013\n[[Richard Smyth (Regius Professor)|Richard Smyth]] \u2013\n[[Simon Matthew]] \u2013\n[[John Pryn]] \u2013\n[[William Buckmaster]] \u2013\n[[William May (theologian)|William May]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Wotton]] \u2013\n[[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] \u2013\n[[John Edmunds (academic)|John Edmunds]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Robertson (divine)|Thomas Robertson]] \u2013\n[[John Baker (English statesman)|John Baker]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Barett]] \u2013\n[[John Hase]] \u2013\n[[John Tyson (divine)|John Tyson]]\n\nIn August 1537, it was presented to the King who ordered that parts should be read from the pulpit every Sunday and feast day.

And he amended the First Commandment ('Thou shalt have none other gods but me') to read 'Thou shalt not have nor repute any other God, or gods, but me Jesu Christ.'\"</ref> weakened the original's emphasis on justification by faith.

The conservatives included Bishops Sampson and Stokesley along with [[George Day (bishop)|George Day]] and [[Nicholas Wilson (parson)|Nicholas Wilson]]. Bishop Tunstall was involved in negotiations as well.</ref>\n\nThe Germans presented, as a basis of agreement, a number of articles based on the Lutheran Confession of Augsburg. Bishops [[Cuthbert Tunstall|Tunstall]], [[John Stokesley|Stokesley]] and others were not won over by these Protestant arguments and did everything they could to avoid agreement. They were willing to separate from Rome, but their plan was to unite with the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] and not with the Protestants on the continent.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} The bishops also refused to eliminate what the Germans considered abuses (e.g. private masses for the dead, compulsory [[clerical celibacy]], and withholding [[communion wine]] from the [[laity]]) allowed by the English Church.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=219}} Stokesley considered these customs to be essential because the Greek Church practised them.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} As the King was unwilling to break with these practices, the Germans had all left England by 1 October.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=221}}\n\nMeanwhile, England was in religious turmoil. Impatient Protestants took it upon themselves to further reform \u2014 some priests said mass in English rather than Latin and married without authorisation (Archbishop Cranmer was himself secretly married). Protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held Lutheran beliefs upholding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and radicals who held [[Anabaptist]] and [[Sacramentarian]] views denying real presence.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 269\u2013270}} In May 1539, a new Parliament met, and [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Audley]] told the [[House of Lords]] that the King desired religious uniformity. A committee of four conservative and four reformist bishops was appointed to examine and determine doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | p = 273}}: The committee was headed by Cromwell, the vicegerent, and the bishops included Cranmer and his Protestant allies \u2014 Latimer, Goodrich, Salcot \u2014 and their traditionalist counterparts Lee, Tunstall, Clerk and Robert Aldrich of Carlisle.</ref> On May 16, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] noted that the committee had not agreed on anything and proposed that the Lords examine six controversial doctrinal questions that became the basis of the Six Articles:\n\n#whether the Eucharist could be the true body of Christ without transubstantiation,\n#whether it needed to be given to the laity [[Communion under both kinds|under both kinds]],\n#whether [[Religious vows|vows]] of [[chastity]] needed to be observed as part of divine law,\n#whether clerical celibacy should be compulsory,\n#whether [[Votive Mass|private masses]] were required by divine law,\n#whether auricular [[Confession (religion)|confession]] (that is, confession to a priest) was necessary as part of divine law?{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}{{sfn|Ridley|2013|p=180}}\n\nOver the next month, these questions were argued in Parliament and Convocation with the active participation of the King. The final product was an affirmation of traditional teachings on all questions. Communion in one kind, compulsory clerical celibacy, vows of chastity and votive masses were acceptable by divine law.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Protestants achieved a minor victory on auricular confession, which was declared \"expedient and necessary to be retained\" but not required by divine law. In addition, although the real presence was affirmed in traditional terminology, the word ''transubstantiation'' itself did not appear in the final version.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | title = The Act of the Six Articles | date = 1539 | website = tudorplace.com.ar | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180912225855/http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | archive-date = 2018-09-12 | url-status = live | access-date = 1 December 2018}}. The article on the Eucharist defines the real presence in these terms: \"First, that in the most blessed Sacrament of the Altar, by the strength and efficacy of Christ's mighty word, it being spoken by the priest, is present really, under the form of bread and wine, the natural body and blood of Our Saviour Jesu Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the consecration there remaineth no substance of bread and wine, nor any other substance but the substance of Christ, God and man\".</ref>\n\nThe Act of Six Articles became law in June 1539, which, unlike the Ten Articles, gave the Six Articles statutory authority. Harsh penalties were attached to violations of the Articles. Denial of transubstantiation was punished by burning without an opportunity to [[recant]]. Denial of any of the other articles was punished by hanging or life imprisonment.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Married priests had until 12 July to put away their wives, which was likely a concession granted to give Archbishop Cranmer time to move his wife and children outside of England.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=249}} After the act's passage, bishops Latimer and Shaxton, outspoken opponents of the measure, were forced to resign their dioceses.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=251}} The Act of Six Articles was repealed in 1547 during the reign of Henry's son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 312}}\n\n===''King's Book'' (1543)===\nWhen Parliament re-convened in April 1540, a committee was formed to revise the ''Bishops' Book'', which Henry VIII had never liked. The committee's membership included both traditionalists and reformers, but the former held the majority.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 279}} Convocation began discussing the revised text in April 1543. The ''King's Book'', or ''The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for Any Christian Man'' to use its formal title, was more traditional than the 1537 version and incorporated many of the King's own revisions. It was approved by a [[Magnum Concilium|special meeting of the nobility]] on 6 May and differed from the ''Bishop's Book'' in having been issued under the King's authority. It was also statutorily enforced by the [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 160\u2013161}}\n\nSignificantly, the doctrine of justification by faith was totally rejected. Cranmer tried to save the doctrine by arguing that while true faith was accompanied by good works (in other words, faith was not ''alone'') it was only faith that justified. However, Henry would not be persuaded, and the text was amended to read that faith justified \"neither only nor alone\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} It also stated that each person had free will to be \"a worker ... in the attaining of his own justification\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 288}} The ''King's Book'' also endorsed traditional views of the mass, transubstantiation, confession, and Church ceremonies.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} The traditional seven sacraments were all included without any distinction in importance made between them. It was taught that the second commandment did not forbid images but only \"godly honour\" being given to them. Looking at images of Christ and the saints \"provoked, kindled and stirred to yield thanks to Our Lord\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 288\u2013289}}\n\nThe one area in which the ''King's Book'' moved away from traditional teaching was on prayer for the dead and purgatory. It taught that no one could know whether prayers or masses for the dead benefited an individual soul, and it was better to offer prayers for \"the universal congregation of Christian people, quick and dead\". People were encouraged to \"abstain from the name of purgatory, and no more dispute or reason thereof\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}} Presumably, the hostility towards purgatory derived from its connection to papal authority. The King's own behavior sent mixed signals. In 1540, he allowed offerings for the souls of deceased [[Knights of the Garter]] to be spent on works of charity instead of masses. At the same time, however, he required the new cathedral foundations to pray for the soul of [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane]]. Perhaps due to the uncertainty surrounding this doctrine, bequests in wills for [[Chantry|chantries]], [[Obiit|obits]] and masses fell by half what they had been in the 1520s.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}}\n\n===Forty-two Articles (1553)===\n\nThe Forty-two Articles{{sfn|Bray|2004|p=284}} were intended to summarise [[Anglican]] doctrine, as it now existed under the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who favoured a Protestant faith. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, they were to be short formularies that would demonstrate the faith revealed in [[Scripture]] and the existing ecumenical creeds.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} Completed in 1552, they were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} The articles were claimed to have received the authority of a Convocation, although this is doubtful.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} With the coronation of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the Articles were never enforced.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} However, after Mary's death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} In 1563, Convocation met under [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]] to revise the articles.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article XXIX to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} In 1571, the Article XXIX, despite the opposition of Bishop [[Edmund Gheast]], was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} This was done following the queen's [[excommunication]] by the [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome and it was no longer necessary to fear that Article XXIX would offend Catholic sensibilities.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required to assent.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}}\n\n==Content==\n[[Image:Elizabeth1England.jpg|right|thumb|Elizabeth I, in whose reign the Thirty-nine Articles were passed.]]\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were not intended as a complete statement of the Christian faith, but of the position of the Church of England in relation to the Catholic Church and dissident [[Protestants]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The Articles argue against some [[Anabaptist]] positions such as the holding of [[Common ownership|goods in common]] and the necessity of [[believer's baptism]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The motivation for their production and enactment was the absence of a general consensus on matters of faith following the separation from Rome.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} There was a concern that dissenters who wanted the reforms to go much further (for example, to abolish the three-fold ministry by eliminating bishops) would increase in influence. Wishing to pursue Elizabeth's agenda of establishing a national church that would maintain the indigenous [[apostolic succession|apostolic faith]] and incorporate some of the insights of Protestantism, the Articles were intended to incorporate a balance of theology and doctrine. This allowed them to appeal to the broadest domestic opinion, Catholic and otherwise.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} In this sense, the Articles are a revealing window into the ethos and character of Anglicanism, in particular in the way the document works to navigate a ''[[via media]]'' (\"middle path\") between the beliefs and practices of the Lutheran and of the Reformed churches, thus lending the Church of England a mainstream Reformed air. The \"via media\" was expressed so adroitly in the Articles that some Anglican scholars have labelled their content as an early example of the idea that the doctrine of Anglicanism is one of \"Reformed Catholicism\".{{sfn|Chadwick|1988|p=}} The Articles therefore state that there are only two [[sacrament]]s \u2013 baptism and communion \u2013 they reject the idea of [[transsubstantiation]] and clerical [[celibacy]], as well as the idea of [[purgatory]] and the possibility of [[indulgence]]s.\n\nThe Articles highlight the Anglican positions with regard to orthodox Catholic teachings, to [[Puritan]]ism, and to Anabaptist thought.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}\nThey are divided, in compliance with the command of Queen Elizabeth, into four sections: Articles 1\u20138, \"The Catholic Faith\"; Articles 9\u201318, \"Personal Religion\"; Articles 19\u201331, \"Corporate Religion\"; and Articles 32\u201339, \"Miscellaneous.\"  The articles were issued both in English and in Latin, and both are of equal authority.\n\n'''Articles I\u2013VIII: The Catholic Articles''':\nThe first five articles articulate the Catholic credal statements concerning the nature of God, manifest in the [[Holy Trinity]]. Articles VI and VII deal with scripture, while Article VIII discusses the essential creeds.\n\n'''Articles IX\u2013XVIII: The Protestant and Reformed Articles''':\nThese articles dwell on the topics of [[sin]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and the eternal disposition of the soul. Of particular focus is the major [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] topic of [[justification by faith]].\n\n'''Articles XIX\u2013XXXI: The Anglican Articles''':\nThis section focuses on the expression of faith in the public venue \u2013 the institutional church, the [[episcopal polity|councils of the church]], [[Christian worship|worship]], [[Anglican ministry|ministry]], and [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental theology]].\n\n'''Articles XXXII\u2013XXXIX: Miscellaneous''':\nThese articles concern [[clerical celibacy]], [[excommunication]], traditions of the Church, and other issues not covered elsewhere.\nArticle XXXVII additionally states among other things that the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] has no jurisdiction in the realm of England.\n\n==Interpretation==\n\nIn 1628 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] prefixed a royal declaration to the articles, which demands a literal interpretation of them, threatening discipline for academics or churchmen teaching any personal interpretations or encouraging debate about them. It states: \"no man hereafter shall either print or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and Full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.\"\n\nHowever, what the Articles truly mean has been a matter of debate in the Church since before they were issued. The [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] wing of the Church has taken the Articles at face value. In 2003, evangelical Anglican clergyman Chris Pierce wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Thirty-Nine Articles define the biblically derived summations of precise Christian doctrine. The Thirty-Nine Articles are more than minimally assented to; they are believed wholeheartedly. In earlier times English and Irish evangelicals would have read Cranmer, [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]], [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]], [[James Ussher|Ussher]], and [[J. C. Ryle|Ryle]] and would unreservedly agree with Dean Litton's assessment that (quoted by Dean Paul Zahl, in his work 'The Protestant Face of Anglicanism'), 'The Anglican Church, if she is to be judged by the statements of the Articles, must be ranked among the Protestant Churches of Europe.'{{sfn|Pierce|2003}} }}\n\nThis view has never been held by the whole church. In 1643, [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] [[John Bramhall]] laid out the core argument against the Articles:\n\n{{quote|Some of them are the very same that are contained in the Creed; some others of them are practical truths, which come not within the proper list of points or articles to be believed; lastly, some of them are pious opinions or inferior truths, which are proposed by the Church of England to all her sons, as not to be opposed; not as essentials of Faith necessary to be believed by all Christians ''necessitate medii,'' under pain of damnation.{{sfn|Bramhall|1842|p=355}} }}\n\nThis divergence of opinion became overt during the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century. The stipulations of Articles XXV and XXVIII were regularly invoked by evangelicals to oppose the reintroduction of certain beliefs, customs, and acts of piety with respect to the sacraments. In response, [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[Tract 90]] attempted to show that the 39 Articles could be read according to an [[Anglo-Catholic]] interpretation.{{sfn|Newman|1841|p=}}\n\n==History and influence==\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''The Book of Common Prayer'' of 1662 included the Thirty-nine Articles.]]\nAdherence to the Articles was made a legal requirement by the English Parliament in 1571. They are printed in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and other Anglican prayer books. The [[Test Act]] of 1672 made adherence to the Articles a requirement for holding civil office in England until its repeal in 1828. Students at [[Oxford University]] were still expected to sign up to them until the passing of the [[Oxford University Act 1854]].\n\nIn the past, in numerous national churches and dioceses, those entering [[Holy Orders]] had to make an oath of subscription to the Articles. Clergy of the Church of England are required to affirm their loyalty to the Articles and other historic formularies (the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests and Deacons). The Church of Ireland has a similar declaration for its clergy, while some other churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] make no such requirement.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/files/worship/pdf/InstitutionHC.pdf|title=Institution of an Incumbent|pages=24|work=Book of Common Prayer|year=2004|publisher=[[Church of Ireland]]}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the Articles on Anglican thought, doctrine and practice has been profound. Although Article VIII itself states that the three Catholic creeds are a sufficient statement of faith, the Articles have often been perceived as the nearest thing to a supplementary confession of faith possessed by the Anglican tradition.\n\nA revised version was adopted in 1801 by the US Episcopal Church which deleted the Athanasian Creed. Earlier, [[John Wesley]], founder of the [[Methodists]], adapted the Thirty-nine Articles for use by [[United Methodist Church|American Methodists]] in the 18th century. The resulting [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] remain official United Methodist doctrine.\n\nIn Anglican discourse, the Articles are regularly cited and interpreted to clarify doctrine and practice. Sometimes they are used to prescribe support of Anglican comprehensiveness. An important concrete manifestation of this is the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]], which incorporates Articles VI, VIII, XXV, and XXXVI in its broad articulation of fundamental Anglican identity. In other circumstances they delineate the parameters of acceptable belief and practice in proscriptive fashion.\n\nThe Articles continue to be invoked today in the Anglican Church. For example, in the ongoing debate over homosexual activity and the concomitant controversies over episcopal authority, Articles VI, XX, XXIII, XXVI, and XXXIV are regularly cited by those of various opinions.\n\nEach of the 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion is, however, free to adopt and authorise its own official documents, and the Articles are not officially normative in all Anglican Churches (neither is the [[Athanasian Creed]]). The only doctrinal documents agreed upon in the Anglican Communion are the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed of AD 325, and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. Beside these documents, authorised liturgical formularies, such as Prayer Book and Ordinal, are normative. The several provincial editions of Prayer Books (and authorised alternative liturgies) are, however, not identical, although they share a greater or smaller amount of family resemblance. No specific edition of the Prayer Book is therefore binding for the entire Communion.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n<!--\nUsing this template per Wikipedia:Citation templates\n{{cite news |first= |last= |author-link=  |title= |url= |format= |work= |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |access-date= |language= |quote= }}\n...OR...\n{{cite web |url= |title= |access-date=  |last= |first= |author-link= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}\n  ...OR...\n{{cite journal |last= |first=  |author-link= |coauthors=  |year= |month= |title= |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |access-date= |quote= |ref= harv }}\n ...OR....\n{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=  |editor=  |title= |orig-date= |orig-year= |orig-month= |url= |format= |access-date= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |ch-apterurl= |quote= }}\n-->\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book | year =1993 | editor-last = Ayris | editor-first = Paul | editor2-last =Selwyn | editor2-first = David | title =Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar | place = Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK | publisher =[[Boydell & Brewer|The Boydell Press]] | isbn =0-85115-549-9 | ref =harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Blunt | first = John Henry | title = The Reformation of the Church of England: Its History, Principles and Results | publisher = Rivingtons | volume = Part 1 AD 1514\u20131547 | edition = 4th | year = 1878 | location = London, Oxford, and Cambridge | url = https://books.google.tt/books?id=M9UwAQAAMAAJ | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|last=Bramhall|first=John |title=The Works of Archbishop Bramhall |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O10PAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA355|volume=Vol. 2|year=1842|publisher=J.H.

Articles''' or the '''XXXIX Articles''') are the historically defining statements of doctrines and practices of the [[Church of England]] with respect to the controversies of the [[English Reformation]].  The Thirty-nine Articles form part of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' used by both the Church of England and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nWhen [[Henry VIII]] broke with the Catholic Church and was [[excommunication|excommunicated]], he began the reform of the Church of England, which would be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|headed]] by the monarch (himself) rather than the pope. At this point, he needed to determine what its doctrines and practices would be in relation to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the new [[Protestantism|Protestant movements]] in continental Europe. A series of defining documents were written and replaced over a period of 30 years as the doctrinal and political situation changed from the excommunication of Henry VIII in 1533, to the [[excommunication of Elizabeth I]] in 1570.  These positions began with the Ten Articles in 1536, and concluded with the finalisation of the Thirty-nine articles in 1571. The Thirty-nine articles ultimately served to define the doctrine of the Church of England as it related to [[Calvinist]] doctrine and Roman Catholic practice.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe articles went through at least five major revisions prior to their finalisation in 1571. The first attempt was the Ten Articles in 1536, which showed some slightly Protestant leanings \u2013 the result of an English desire for a political alliance with the German [[Lutheran]] princes.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} The next revision was the Six Articles in 1539 which swung away from all reformed positions,{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} and then the ''King's Book'' in 1543, which re-established most of the earlier Roman Catholic doctrines. During the reign of [[Edward VI]], Henry VIII's only son, the Forty-two Articles were written under the direction of [[Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1552. It was in this document that Calvinist thought reached the zenith of its influence in the English Church. These articles were never put into action, due to Edward VI's death and the reversion of the English Church to Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII's elder daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nFinally, upon the coronation of Elizabeth I and the re-establishment of the Church of England as separate from the Roman Catholic Church, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion were initiated by the [[Convocation of 1563]], under the direction of [[Matthew Parker]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The articles pulled back from some of the more extreme Calvinist thinking and created the distinctive English reformed doctrine.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were finalised in 1571, and incorporated into the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although not the end of the struggle between Catholic and Protestant monarchs and citizens, the book helped to standardise the English language, and was to have a lasting effect on [[religion in the United Kingdom]] and elsewhere through its wide use.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1999|p=}}\n\n==Predecessors==\n===Ten Articles (1536)===\nThe [[Church of England]]'s break with Rome inaugurated a period of doctrinal confusion and controversy as both conservative and reforming clergy attempted to shape the church's direction, the former as \"[[Catholicism]] without the [[Pope]]\" and the latter as [[Protestant]]. In an attempt \"to establish Christian quietness and unity\", the Ten Articles were adopted by clerical [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Convocation]] in July 1536 as the English Church's first post-papal doctrinal statement.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}} The Ten Articles were crafted as a rushed interim compromise between conservatives and reformers. Historians have variously described it as a victory for [[Lutheranism]] and a success for Catholic resistance.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 128}} Its provisions have also been described as \"confusing\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nThe first five articles dealt with doctrines that were \"commanded expressly by God, and are necessary to our [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]\", while the last five articles dealt with \"laudable ceremonies used in the Church\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} This division reflects how the Articles originated from two different discussions earlier in the year. The first five articles were based on the Wittenberg Articles negotiated between English ambassadors [[Edward Foxe]], [[Nicholas Heath]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] and German Lutheran theologians, including [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]]. This doctrinal statement was itself based on the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530.{{Sfn | \"Wittenberg Articles\"}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}}\n\nThe five principal doctrines were the [[Bible]] and [[ecumenical creeds]], [[baptism]], [[penance]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Justification (theology)|justification]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} The core doctrine in the Ten Articles was [[justification by faith]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}} Justification \u2013 which was defined as [[Forgiveness|remission]] of [[sin]] and accepting into God's favour \u2013 was through \"the only mercy and [[Grace in Christianity|grace]] of the [[God the Father|Father]], promised freely unto us for his Son\u2019s sake [[Jesus Christ]], and the merits of his [[Blood of Christ|blood]] and [[Passion of Jesus|passion]]\".{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} [[Good works]] would follow, not precede, justification. However, the Lutheran influence was diluted with qualifications. Justification was attained \"by [[Contrition|contrition]] and [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] joined with [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}}  In other words, good works were \"necessarily required to the attaining of everlasting life\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nTo the disappointment of conservatives, only three of the traditional seven [[sacrament]]s were even mentioned (baptism, the Eucharist and penance).{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} The Articles affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], stating that \"under the form and figure of bread and wine ... is verily, substantially and really contained the very self-same body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} This definition was acceptable to those who held to [[transubstantiation]] or [[sacramental union]], but it clearly condemned [[sacramentarianism]]. More controversially for the reformers, the Articles maintained penance as a sacrament and the [[priest]]'s authority to grant divine [[absolution]] in [[Confession (religion)|confession]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nArticles six through ten focused on secondary issues. Significantly, [[purgatory]], which had been a central concern of medieval religion, was placed in the non-essential articles. On the question of its existence, the Ten Articles were ambiguous. It stated, \"the place where [departed souls] be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there\" was \"uncertain by scripture\". [[Prayer for the dead]] and [[Requiem|masses for the dead]] were permitted as possibly relieving the pain of departed souls in purgatory.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 240}} \n\nThe Articles also defended the use of a number of Catholic rituals and practices opposed by Protestants, such as kissing the cross on [[Good Friday]], while mildly criticizing popular abuses and excesses. The use of [[Religious images in Christian theology|religious images]] was permitted, but people were to be taught not to kneel before them or make [[Votive offering|offerings]] to them. Prayer to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], and all the other [[saint]]s was permitted as long as [[superstition]] was avoided.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 238\u2013239}} \n\nIn summary, the Ten Articles asserted:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | title = Ten Articles 1536 | website = reformationhenryviii.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180803183730/http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | archive-date = August 3, 2018 | url-status = live | access-date = August 3, 2018 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n# The Bible and the three ecumenical creeds are the basis and summary of true Christian faith.\n# Baptism imparts [[Forgiveness|remission of sins]] and [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and is necessary for salvation, even in the case of infants. It condemns the opinions of [[Anabaptist]]s and [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] as [[heresy]]. \n# The sacrament of penance, with confession and absolution, is necessary to salvation.\n# That the body and blood of Christ are really present in the Eucharist.\n# Justification is by faith, but good works are necessary.\n# Images can be used as representations of virtue and good example and also to remind people of their sins but are not objects of worship.\n# Saints are to be honored as examples of life and as furthering the prayers of the faithful.\n# [[Intercession of saints|Praying to saints]] is permitted, and holy days should be observed.\n# The observance of various rites and ceremonies, such as clerical [[vestment]]s, sprinkling of [[holy water]], bearing of candles on [[Candlemas]], giving of ashes on [[Ash Wednesday]], is good and laudable. However, none of these has power to forgive sin. \n# It is a good and charitable deed to pray for the dead. However, the doctrine of purgatory is biblically uncertain. Abuses related to purgatory, such as the claim that papal [[indulgence]]s or masses for the dead offered at certain localities (such as the ''[[Santa Maria Scala Coeli|scala coeli]]'' mass) can deliver immediately from purgatory, are to be rejected.\n\n=== ''Bishops' Book'' (1537) ===\n\n[[Image:Thomas-Cranmer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Cranmer]] headed the committee that authored the ''Bishop's Book''.]]\n\nThe failure of the Ten Articles to settle doctrinal controversy led [[Thomas Cromwell]], the King's [[vicegerent]] in spirituals, to convene a national [[synod]] of bishops and high-ranking clergy for further theological discussion in February 1537.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=185\u2013186}} This synod produced a book called ''The Institution of the Christian Man'' (popularly called ''The Bishops' Book''), the word ''institution'' being synonymous with ''instruction''.{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 444}} ''The Bishops' Book'' preserved the semi-Lutheranism of the Ten Articles, and the articles on justification, purgatory, and the sacraments of baptism, the Eucharist and penance were incorporated unchanged into the new book.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 255}}\n \nWhen the synod met, conservatives were still angry that four of the traditional seven sacraments ([[confirmation]], marriage, [[holy orders]] and [[extreme unction]]) had been excluded from the Ten Articles. [[John Stokesley]] argued for all seven, while [[Thomas Cranmer]] only acknowledged baptism and the Eucharist. The others divided along party lines.

In agreement with the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]]'s church at Zurich, the authors of the ''Bishops' Book'' adopted the Jewish tradition of separating these commandments. While allowing images of Christ and the saints, the exposition on the second commandment taught against representations of [[God the Father]] and criticised those who \"be more ready with their substance to deck dead images gorgeously and gloriously, than with the same to help poor Christian people, the quick and lively [[Image of God|images of God]]\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Such teachings encouraged [[iconoclasm]], which would become a feature of the English Reformation.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=192}} \n\nThe list of the 46 divines as they appear in the ''Bishop's Book'' included all of the [[bishop]]s, eight [[archdeacon]]s and 17 other [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]], some of whom were later involved with translating the [[Great Bible|Bible]] and compiling the [[The Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]:{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 445}}\n\n[[Thomas Cranmer]] \u2013\n[[Edward Lee, Archbishop of York|Edward Lee]] \u2013\n[[John Stokesley]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Tunstall]] \u2013\n[[Stephen Gardiner]] \u2013\n[[Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle|Robert Aldrich]] \u2013\n[[John Voysey]] \u2013\n[[John Longland]] \u2013\n[[John Clerk, Bishop of Bath and Wells|John Clerk]] \u2013\n[[Rowland Lee]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Goodrich]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Shaxton]] \u2013\n[[John Bird (Bishop)|John Bird]] \u2013\n[[Edward Foxe]] \u2013\n[[Hugh Latimer]] \u2013\n[[John Hilsey]] \u2013\n[[Richard Sampson]] \u2013\n[[William Repps]] \u2013\n[[William Barlowe]] \u2013\n[[Robert Partew]] \u2013\n[[Robert Holgate]] \u2013\n[[Richard Wolman]] \u2013\n[[William Knight (royal servant)|William Knight]] \u2013\n[[John Bell, Bishop of Worcester|John Bell]] \u2013\n[[Edmund Bonner|Edmond Bonner]] \u2013\n[[William Skip]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Heath]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Marshal]] \u2013\n[[Richard Curren]] \u2013\n[[William Cliffe]] \u2013\n[[William Downes (divine)|William Downes]] \u2013\n[[Robert Oking]] \u2013\n[[Ralph Bradford]] \u2013\n[[Richard Smyth (Regius Professor)|Richard Smyth]] \u2013\n[[Simon Matthew]] \u2013\n[[John Pryn]] \u2013\n[[William Buckmaster]] \u2013\n[[William May (theologian)|William May]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Wotton]] \u2013\n[[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] \u2013\n[[John Edmunds (academic)|John Edmunds]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Robertson (divine)|Thomas Robertson]] \u2013\n[[John Baker (English statesman)|John Baker]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Barett]] \u2013\n[[John Hase]] \u2013\n[[John Tyson (divine)|John Tyson]]\n\nIn August 1537, it was presented to the King who ordered that parts should be read from the pulpit every Sunday and feast day.

The conservatives included Bishops Sampson and Stokesley along with [[George Day (bishop)|George Day]] and [[Nicholas Wilson (parson)|Nicholas Wilson]]. Bishop Tunstall was involved in negotiations as well.</ref>\n\nThe Germans presented, as a basis of agreement, a number of articles based on the Lutheran Confession of Augsburg. Bishops [[Cuthbert Tunstall|Tunstall]], [[John Stokesley|Stokesley]] and others were not won over by these Protestant arguments and did everything they could to avoid agreement. They were willing to separate from Rome, but their plan was to unite with the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] and not with the Protestants on the continent.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} The bishops also refused to eliminate what the Germans considered abuses (e.g. private masses for the dead, compulsory [[clerical celibacy]], and withholding [[communion wine]] from the [[laity]]) allowed by the English Church.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=219}} Stokesley considered these customs to be essential because the Greek Church practised them.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} As the King was unwilling to break with these practices, the Germans had all left England by 1 October.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=221}}\n\nMeanwhile, England was in religious turmoil. Impatient Protestants took it upon themselves to further reform \u2014 some priests said mass in English rather than Latin and married without authorisation (Archbishop Cranmer was himself secretly married). Protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held Lutheran beliefs upholding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and radicals who held [[Anabaptist]] and [[Sacramentarian]] views denying real presence.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 269\u2013270}} In May 1539, a new Parliament met, and [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Audley]] told the [[House of Lords]] that the King desired religious uniformity. A committee of four conservative and four reformist bishops was appointed to examine and determine doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | p = 273}}: The committee was headed by Cromwell, the vicegerent, and the bishops included Cranmer and his Protestant allies \u2014 Latimer, Goodrich, Salcot \u2014 and their traditionalist counterparts Lee, Tunstall, Clerk and Robert Aldrich of Carlisle.</ref> On May 16, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] noted that the committee had not agreed on anything and proposed that the Lords examine six controversial doctrinal questions that became the basis of the Six Articles:\n\n#whether the Eucharist could be the true body of Christ without transubstantiation,\n#whether it needed to be given to the laity [[Communion under both kinds|under both kinds]],\n#whether [[Religious vows|vows]] of [[chastity]] needed to be observed as part of divine law,\n#whether clerical celibacy should be compulsory,\n#whether [[Votive Mass|private masses]] were required by divine law,\n#whether auricular [[Confession (religion)|confession]] (that is, confession to a priest) was necessary as part of divine law?{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}{{sfn|Ridley|2013|p=180}}\n\nOver the next month, these questions were argued in Parliament and Convocation with the active participation of the King. The final product was an affirmation of traditional teachings on all questions. Communion in one kind, compulsory clerical celibacy, vows of chastity and votive masses were acceptable by divine law.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Protestants achieved a minor victory on auricular confession, which was declared \"expedient and necessary to be retained\" but not required by divine law. In addition, although the real presence was affirmed in traditional terminology, the word ''transubstantiation'' itself did not appear in the final version.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | title = The Act of the Six Articles | date = 1539 | website = tudorplace.com.ar | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180912225855/http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | archive-date = 2018-09-12 | url-status = live | access-date = 1 December 2018}}. The article on the Eucharist defines the real presence in these terms: \"First, that in the most blessed Sacrament of the Altar, by the strength and efficacy of Christ's mighty word, it being spoken by the priest, is present really, under the form of bread and wine, the natural body and blood of Our Saviour Jesu Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the consecration there remaineth no substance of bread and wine, nor any other substance but the substance of Christ, God and man\".</ref>\n\nThe Act of Six Articles became law in June 1539, which, unlike the Ten Articles, gave the Six Articles statutory authority. Harsh penalties were attached to violations of the Articles. Denial of transubstantiation was punished by burning without an opportunity to [[recant]]. Denial of any of the other articles was punished by hanging or life imprisonment.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Married priests had until 12 July to put away their wives, which was likely a concession granted to give Archbishop Cranmer time to move his wife and children outside of England.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=249}} After the act's passage, bishops Latimer and Shaxton, outspoken opponents of the measure, were forced to resign their dioceses.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=251}} The Act of Six Articles was repealed in 1547 during the reign of Henry's son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 312}}\n\n===''King's Book'' (1543)===\nWhen Parliament re-convened in April 1540, a committee was formed to revise the ''Bishops' Book'', which Henry VIII had never liked. The committee's membership included both traditionalists and reformers, but the former held the majority.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 279}} Convocation began discussing the revised text in April 1543. The ''King's Book'', or ''The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for Any Christian Man'' to use its formal title, was more traditional than the 1537 version and incorporated many of the King's own revisions. It was approved by a [[Magnum Concilium|special meeting of the nobility]] on 6 May and differed from the ''Bishop's Book'' in having been issued under the King's authority. It was also statutorily enforced by the [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 160\u2013161}}\n\nSignificantly, the doctrine of justification by faith was totally rejected. Cranmer tried to save the doctrine by arguing that while true faith was accompanied by good works (in other words, faith was not ''alone'') it was only faith that justified. However, Henry would not be persuaded, and the text was amended to read that faith justified \"neither only nor alone\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} It also stated that each person had free will to be \"a worker ... in the attaining of his own justification\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 288}} The ''King's Book'' also endorsed traditional views of the mass, transubstantiation, confession, and Church ceremonies.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} The traditional seven sacraments were all included without any distinction in importance made between them. It was taught that the second commandment did not forbid images but only \"godly honour\" being given to them. Looking at images of Christ and the saints \"provoked, kindled and stirred to yield thanks to Our Lord\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 288\u2013289}}\n\nThe one area in which the ''King's Book'' moved away from traditional teaching was on prayer for the dead and purgatory. It taught that no one could know whether prayers or masses for the dead benefited an individual soul, and it was better to offer prayers for \"the universal congregation of Christian people, quick and dead\". People were encouraged to \"abstain from the name of purgatory, and no more dispute or reason thereof\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}} Presumably, the hostility towards purgatory derived from its connection to papal authority. The King's own behavior sent mixed signals. In 1540, he allowed offerings for the souls of deceased [[Knights of the Garter]] to be spent on works of charity instead of masses. At the same time, however, he required the new cathedral foundations to pray for the soul of [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane]]. Perhaps due to the uncertainty surrounding this doctrine, bequests in wills for [[Chantry|chantries]], [[Obiit|obits]] and masses fell by half what they had been in the 1520s.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}}\n\n===Forty-two Articles (1553)===\n\nThe Forty-two Articles{{sfn|Bray|2004|p=284}} were intended to summarise [[Anglican]] doctrine, as it now existed under the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who favoured a Protestant faith. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, they were to be short formularies that would demonstrate the faith revealed in [[Scripture]] and the existing ecumenical creeds.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} Completed in 1552, they were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} The articles were claimed to have received the authority of a Convocation, although this is doubtful.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} With the coronation of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the Articles were never enforced.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} However, after Mary's death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} In 1563, Convocation met under [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]] to revise the articles.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article XXIX to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} In 1571, the Article XXIX, despite the opposition of Bishop [[Edmund Gheast]], was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} This was done following the queen's [[excommunication]] by the [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome and it was no longer necessary to fear that Article XXIX would offend Catholic sensibilities.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required to assent.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}}\n\n==Content==\n[[Image:Elizabeth1England.jpg|right|thumb|Elizabeth I, in whose reign the Thirty-nine Articles were passed.]]\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were not intended as a complete statement of the Christian faith, but of the position of the Church of England in relation to the Catholic Church and dissident [[Protestants]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The Articles argue against some [[Anabaptist]] positions such as the holding of [[Common ownership|goods in common]] and the necessity of [[believer's baptism]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The motivation for their production and enactment was the absence of a general consensus on matters of faith following the separation from Rome.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} There was a concern that dissenters who wanted the reforms to go much further (for example, to abolish the three-fold ministry by eliminating bishops) would increase in influence. Wishing to pursue Elizabeth's agenda of establishing a national church that would maintain the indigenous [[apostolic succession|apostolic faith]] and incorporate some of the insights of Protestantism, the Articles were intended to incorporate a balance of theology and doctrine. This allowed them to appeal to the broadest domestic opinion, Catholic and otherwise.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} In this sense, the Articles are a revealing window into the ethos and character of Anglicanism, in particular in the way the document works to navigate a ''[[via media]]'' (\"middle path\") between the beliefs and practices of the Lutheran and of the Reformed churches, thus lending the Church of England a mainstream Reformed air. The \"via media\" was expressed so adroitly in the Articles that some Anglican scholars have labelled their content as an early example of the idea that the doctrine of Anglicanism is one of \"Reformed Catholicism\".{{sfn|Chadwick|1988|p=}} The Articles therefore state that there are only two [[sacrament]]s \u2013 baptism and communion \u2013 they reject the idea of [[transsubstantiation]] and clerical [[celibacy]] as well the idea of [[purgatory]] and the possibility of [[indulgence]]s.\n\nThe Articles highlight the Anglican positions with regard to orthodox Catholic teachings, to [[Puritan]]ism, and to Anabaptist thought.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}\nThey are divided, in compliance with the command of Queen Elizabeth, into four sections: Articles 1\u20138, \"The Catholic Faith\"; Articles 9\u201318, \"Personal Religion\"; Articles 19\u201331, \"Corporate Religion\"; and Articles 32\u201339, \"Miscellaneous.\"  The articles were issued both in English and in Latin, and both are of equal authority.\n\n'''Articles I\u2013VIII: The Catholic Articles''':\nThe first five articles articulate the Catholic credal statements concerning the nature of God, manifest in the [[Holy Trinity]]. Articles VI and VII deal with scripture, while Article VIII discusses the essential creeds.\n\n'''Articles IX\u2013XVIII: The Protestant and Reformed Articles''':\nThese articles dwell on the topics of [[sin]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and the eternal disposition of the soul. Of particular focus is the major [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] topic of [[justification by faith]].\n\n'''Articles XIX\u2013XXXI: The Anglican Articles''':\nThis section focuses on the expression of faith in the public venue \u2013 the institutional church, the [[episcopal polity|councils of the church]], [[Christian worship|worship]], [[Anglican ministry|ministry]], and [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental theology]].\n\n'''Articles XXXII\u2013XXXIX: Miscellaneous''':\nThese articles concern [[clerical celibacy]], [[excommunication]], traditions of the Church, and other issues not covered elsewhere.\nArticle XXXVII additionally states among other things that the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] has no jurisdiction in the realm of England.\n\n==Interpretation==\n\nIn 1628 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] prefixed a royal declaration to the articles, which demands a literal interpretation of them, threatening discipline for academics or churchmen teaching any personal interpretations or encouraging debate about them. It states: \"no man hereafter shall either print or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and Full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.\"\n\nHowever, what the Articles truly mean has been a matter of debate in the Church since before they were issued. The [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] wing of the Church has taken the Articles at face value. In 2003, evangelical Anglican clergyman Chris Pierce wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Thirty-Nine Articles define the biblically derived summations of precise Christian doctrine. The Thirty-Nine Articles are more than minimally assented to; they are believed wholeheartedly. In earlier times English and Irish evangelicals would have read Cranmer, [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]], [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]], [[James Ussher|Ussher]], and [[J. C. Ryle|Ryle]] and would unreservedly agree with Dean Litton's assessment that (quoted by Dean Paul Zahl, in his work 'The Protestant Face of Anglicanism'), 'The Anglican Church, if she is to be judged by the statements of the Articles, must be ranked among the Protestant Churches of Europe.'{{sfn|Pierce|2003}} }}\n\nThis view has never been held by the whole church. In 1643, [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] [[John Bramhall]] laid out the core argument against the Articles:\n\n{{quote|Some of them are the very same that are contained in the Creed; some others of them are practical truths, which come not within the proper list of points or articles to be believed; lastly, some of them are pious opinions or inferior truths, which are proposed by the Church of England to all her sons, as not to be opposed; not as essentials of Faith necessary to be believed by all Christians ''necessitate medii,'' under pain of damnation.{{sfn|Bramhall|1842|p=355}} }}\n\nThis divergence of opinion became overt during the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century. The stipulations of Articles XXV and XXVIII were regularly invoked by evangelicals to oppose the reintroduction of certain beliefs, customs, and acts of piety with respect to the sacraments. In response, [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[Tract 90]] attempted to show that the 39 Articles could be read according to an [[Anglo-Catholic]] interpretation.{{sfn|Newman|1841|p=}}\n\n==History and influence==\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''The Book of Common Prayer'' of 1662 included the Thirty-nine Articles.]]\nAdherence to the Articles was made a legal requirement by the English Parliament in 1571. They are printed in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and other Anglican prayer books. The [[Test Act]] of 1672 made adherence to the Articles a requirement for holding civil office in England until its repeal in 1828. Students at [[Oxford University]] were still expected to sign up to them until the passing of the [[Oxford University Act 1854]].\n\nIn the past, in numerous national churches and dioceses, those entering [[Holy Orders]] had to make an oath of subscription to the Articles. Clergy of the Church of England are required to affirm their loyalty to the Articles and other historic formularies (the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests and Deacons). The Church of Ireland has a similar declaration for its clergy, while some other churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] make no such requirement.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/files/worship/pdf/InstitutionHC.pdf|title=Institution of an Incumbent|pages=24|work=Book of Common Prayer|year=2004|publisher=[[Church of Ireland]]}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the Articles on Anglican thought, doctrine and practice has been profound. Although Article VIII itself states that the three Catholic creeds are a sufficient statement of faith, the Articles have often been perceived as the nearest thing to a supplementary confession of faith possessed by the Anglican tradition.\n\nA revised version was adopted in 1801 by the US Episcopal Church which deleted the Athanasian Creed. Earlier, [[John Wesley]], founder of the [[Methodists]], adapted the Thirty-nine Articles for use by [[United Methodist Church|American Methodists]] in the 18th century. The resulting [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] remain official United Methodist doctrine.\n\nIn Anglican discourse, the Articles are regularly cited and interpreted to clarify doctrine and practice. Sometimes they are used to prescribe support of Anglican comprehensiveness. An important concrete manifestation of this is the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]], which incorporates Articles VI, VIII, XXV, and XXXVI in its broad articulation of fundamental Anglican identity. In other circumstances they delineate the parameters of acceptable belief and practice in proscriptive fashion.\n\nThe Articles continue to be invoked today in the Anglican Church. For example, in the ongoing debate over homosexual activity and the concomitant controversies over episcopal authority, Articles VI, XX, XXIII, XXVI, and XXXIV are regularly cited by those of various opinions.\n\nEach of the 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion is, however, free to adopt and authorise its own official documents, and the Articles are not officially normative in all Anglican Churches (neither is the [[Athanasian Creed]]). The only doctrinal documents agreed upon in the Anglican Communion are the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed of AD 325, and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. Beside these documents, authorised liturgical formularies, such as Prayer Book and Ordinal, are normative. The several provincial editions of Prayer Books (and authorised alternative liturgies) are, however, not identical, although they share a greater or smaller amount of family resemblance. No specific edition of the Prayer Book is therefore binding for the entire Communion.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n<!--\nUsing this template per Wikipedia:Citation templates\n{{cite news |first= |last= |author-link=  |title= |url= |format= |work= |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |access-date= |language= |quote= }}\n...OR...\n{{cite web |url= |title= |access-date=  |last= |first= |author-link= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}\n  ...OR...\n{{cite journal |last= |first=  |author-link= |coauthors=  |year= |month= |title= |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |access-date= |quote= |ref= harv }}\n ...OR....\n{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=  |editor=  |title= |orig-date= |orig-year= |orig-month= |url= |format= |access-date= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |ch-apterurl= |quote= }}\n-->\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book | year =1993 | editor-last = Ayris | editor-first = Paul | editor2-last =Selwyn | editor2-first = David | title =Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar | place = Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK | publisher =[[Boydell & Brewer|The Boydell Press]] | isbn =0-85115-549-9 | ref =harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Blunt | first = John Henry | title = The Reformation of the Church of England: Its History, Principles and Results | publisher = Rivingtons | volume = Part 1 AD 1514\u20131547 | edition = 4th | year = 1878 | location = London, Oxford, and Cambridge | url = https://books.google.tt/books?id=M9UwAQAAMAAJ | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|last=Bramhall|first=John |title=The Works of Archbishop Bramhall |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O10PAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA355|volume=Vol. 2|year=1842|publisher=J.H.

It is normally abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] $, or alternatively TT$ to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]]. Cents are abbreviated with the [[cent sign]] \u00a2, or TT\u00a2 to distinguish from other currencies that use cents. Its predecessor currencies are the [[Trinidadian dollar]] and the Tobagonian dollar.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of currency in the former  British colony of Trinidad and Tobago closely follows that of the British [[Eastern Caribbean]] territories in general. The first currency used was the [[Spanish dollar]], also known as \"pieces of eight\", which began circulating in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=huhPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 |p=109 |author1=Rita Pemberton |author2=Debbie McCollin |author3=Gelien Matthews |title=Historical Dictionary of Trinidad and Tobago |year=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538111468 }}</ref> Proposals for establishing banks in the West Indies, targeted at landowners, were made in 1661 by the British government, and in 1690 by Sir [[Thomas Dalby]].{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=20}} Despite this, and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s proclamation of 1704 that brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver [[pieces of eight]] ([[Spanish dollars]] and later [[Mexican dollar]]s) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. \n\nThe abolition of slavery in the West Indies was the catalyst which led to the establishing of the first bank.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=23}} The [[Colonial Bank (West Indies)|Colonial Bank]] was established on 1 June 1836,{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=24}} and opened its first branch in Trinidad in 1837 under the management of [[Anthony Cumming]].{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=25}} Its initial mandate was to use Spanish and Mexican dollars as its official currency, and it was required to make all payments in those currencies, but incoming payments could be made in any currency, and the bank often found that it was short of dollars.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=26\u201327}} The bank therefore lobbied the government, seeking permission to issue money in other currencies.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=28\u201329}} This resulted in an  imperial order-in-council in 1838, in which Trinidad and Tobago formally adopted the [[Pound sterling|sterling]] currency, although the Spanish, Mexican and Colombian currencies were also declared legal tender.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=28\u201329}}\n\nA second bank, the [[West India Bank]], was granted a Royal Charter in 1840, and opened its first branch in 1843.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=35}} The loss of its monopoly had a profound effect on the Colonial Bank, which was also at a disadvantage due to not being permitted to pay interest on deposits, as the West India Bank did.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=36\u201337}} The two banks pursued opposite strategies, with the Colonial Bank maintaining a conservative stance, including removing currency from circulation,{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=36\u201337}} while the West India Bank pursued aggressive expansion.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=38}} The [[Sugar Duties Act]] of 1846, which equalised the duties on sugar imported into the United Kingdom from the British colonies with that of non-British territories, created a financial crisis in Trinidad and Tobago as the price of sugar fell rapidly.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=39\u201340}} The West India Bank, which had taken on too much risk, went bust during the crisis and the Colonial Bank was also put under strain.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in [[Tobago]] in 1879 and in [[Trinidad]] at around the same period. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in the private sector using dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 [[shilling]]s 2 pence. Local banks also issued their own dollars, however, denominated in dollars.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=102}} Government offices kept their accounts in British pounds, shillings, and pence until the year 1935 when Trinidad and Tobago went decimal. The [[Currency Interpretation Ordinance]] of 1934 replaced the system of pounds, shillings and pence with the dollar, retaining the fixed exchange rate of 1 dollar for every 4 shillings 2 pence.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nFrom 1949, with the introduction of the [[British West Indies dollar]], the currency of Trinidad and Tobago became officially tied up with that of the British [[Eastern Caribbean]] territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. In 1951, notes of the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group, were introduced, replacing Trinidad and Tobago's own notes. In 1955, coins were introduced when the dollar was decimalized.\n\nThe currency of the union was replaced by the modern Trinidad and Tobago dollar in 1964,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071315/caribbean-currencies-overview.asp |title=Caribbean Currencies: An Overview |author=Warren Cassell Jr. |work=[[Investopedia]]}}</ref> two years after the nation's independence in 1962.<ref name=\"CentralBank\"/> The Trinidad and Tobago dollar was launched, and had become the sole currency by 1967.<ref name=\"CentralBank\">{{cite web |url=https://www.central-bank.org.tt/currency/about-notes-and-coins/history-money-trinidad-tobago |title=History of Money in Trinidad and Tobago |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=[[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Trinidad and Tobago introduced its own dollar.

A large sized $1 coin was first released for circulation in 1969 and again in 1979 before being replaced with a smaller sized version in 1995 more regularly minted. The 5\u00a2 is struck in bronze, with the other denominations in [[cupro-nickel]]. The obverses all feature Trinidad and Tobago's [[coat of arms]], with the reverse designs solely featuring the denomination until 1976, when they were replaced by either a [[national bird]] or [[national flower|flower]] in addition to the denomination after the declaration of a republic. The 50\u00a2 & $1 coins are scarcely seen in circulation, but can be purchased from banks if requested.\n\nThere are also coins minted in $5, $10, $100 and $200 denominations as well. These coins are not in circulation, and can only be obtained from the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, either as part of a special 'eight-coin proof set' collection (in the case of the $5 and $10 coins) or individually (in the case of the $100 and $200 coins.) Notably, the $5 and $10 coins are minted in sterling [[silver]], whereas the $100 and $200 are minted in [[gold]]. The price of the gold coins fluctuate depending on the current state of the market for gold.\n\nIn 2014 the government stopped minting the 1\u00a2 coin. On 3 July 2018 [[cash rounding]] was implemented as 1\u00a2 coins ceased being legal tender for cash payments, but the Central Bank will redeem them indefinitely in multiples of 5\u00a2.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.central-bank.org.tt/sites/default/files/page-file-uploads/Legal%20Notice%20No.%2035%20of%202018.pdf | title=The Central Bank Act, Chap. 79:02 | publisher=Central-Bank.org.tt | accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n== Banknotes ==\n\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = TRI&TOB-1b-Trinidad & Tobago-1 Dollar (1905).jpg|bSize = 250|cWidth = 250|cHeight = 120|oTop = 0|oLeft = 0|Location = right|Description = First government issue one-dollar note (1905).}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the British gold sovereign was valued at four Spanish silver dollars and eighty cents. When the sterling coinage was finally accepted as the main circulating coinage in the British West Indies, the Eastern Caribbean colonies continued nevertheless to use the dollar unit for accounting purposes. The West Indian dollar was therefore equivalent to four shillings and two pence.\n\nThis Royal Bank of Canada note reflects this state of affairs with its overt mention of the fact that one hundred dollars is equal to twenty pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight pence sterling. This state of affairs was exclusively confined to the Eastern Caribbean region, possibly due to the geographical proximity to British Guiana. British Guiana had a reason to wish to retain the dollar unit owing to its recent changeover from Dutch currency. These factors did not affect Jamaica, Bermuda, or the Bahamas which adopted the sterling currency in both coinage and as the unit of account.\n\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = TRI&TOB-2b-Trinidad & Tobago-2 Dollars (1905).jpg|bSize = 250|cWidth = 250|cHeight = 134|oTop = 0|oLeft = 0|Location = right|Description =First government issue two-dollar note (1905).}}\n\nIn 1898, the Colonial Bank introduced $20 notes. These were followed in 1901 by $5. $100 notes were also issued. The last notes were issued in 1926, after which the Colonial Bank was taken over by [[Barclays Bank]], which issued $5, $20 & $100 notes until 1941. In 1905, notes were introduced by the government in denominations of $1 & $2, followed by $5 in 1935, followed by $10 & $20 in 1942.\n\nThe [[Royal Bank of Canada]] introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1909. From 1920, the notes also bore the denomination in sterling. 100-dollar notes were not issued after 1920, whilst the $5 and $20 were issued until 1938. The [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]] introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1921, with the $5 & $20 notes issued until 1939. The Royal Bank of Canada one hundred dollar note, shown here; is a relic of a monetary system, in which the unit of account was related to the circulating coinage on the basis of two historical coins which were no longer in use.\n\n[[File:Trinidad and Tobago 100 Dollars banknote of 1964.jpg|thumb|Trinidad and Tobago 100 Dollars banknote of 1964]]\n\nOn 14 December 1964, the [[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]] introduced notes for $1, $5, $10 & $20.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Linzmayer | first1 = Owen | title = The Banknote Book | chapter = Trinidad and Tobago | publisher = www.BanknoteNews.com | year = 2012 | location = San Francisco, CA | chapter-url = http://www.banknotebook.com}}</ref> New denominations in the form of $50 & $100 notes were issued on 6 June 1977, although the $50 note was not continued after a shipment was stolen prior to issue. The $50 note was taken out of its brief circulation. The reverses of the current notes feature the Central Bank Building of Trinidad & Tobago. The obverses have the coat of arms in the center, a national bird and a place in Trinidad, such as a market, petroleum refinery, etc. In 2002, new $1 & $20 notes were introduced. In 2003, new $1, $5, $10 & $100 were also introduced. The notes were only slightly changed; they now have more security features & darker colour. Recently, more security features have been added to the notes by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.

It is normally abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] $, or alternatively TT$ to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]]. Cents are abbreviated with the [[cent sign]] \u00a2, or TT\u00a2 to distinguish from other currencies that use cents. Its predecessor currencies are the [[Trinidadian dollar]] and the Tobagonian dollar.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of currency in the former  British colony of Trinidad and Tobago closely follows that of the British [[Eastern Caribbean]] territories in general. The first currency used was the [[Spanish dollar]], also known as \"pieces of eight\", which began circulating in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=huhPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 |p=109 |author1=Rita Pemberton |author2=Debbie McCollin |author3=Gelien Matthews |title=Historical Dictionary of Trinidad and Tobago |year=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538111468 }}</ref> Proposals for establishing banks in the West Indies, targeted at landowners, were made in 1661 by the British government, and in 1690 by Sir [[Thomas Dalby]].{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=20}} Despite this, and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s proclamation of 1704 that brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver [[pieces of eight]] ([[Spanish dollars]] and later [[Mexican dollar]]s) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. \n\nThe abolition of slavery in the West Indies was the catalyst which led to the establishing of the first bank.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=23}} The [[Colonial Bank (West Indies)|Colonial Bank]] was established on 1 June 1836,{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=24}} and opened its first branch in Trinidad in 1837 under the management of [[Anthony Cumming]].{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=25}} Its initial mandate was to use Spanish and Mexican dollars as its official currency, and it was required to make all payments in those currencies, but incoming payments could be made in any currency, and the bank often found that it was short of dollars.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=26\u201327}} The bank therefore lobbied the government, seeking permission to issue money in other currencies.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=28\u201329}} This resulted in an  imperial order-in-council in 1838, in which Trinidad and Tobago formally adopted the [[Pound sterling|sterling]] currency, although the Spanish, Mexican and Colombian currencies were also declared legal tender.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=28\u201329}}\n\nA second bank, the [[West India Bank]], was granted a Royal Charter in 1840, and opened its first branch in 1843.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=35}} The loss of its monopoly had a profound effect on the Colonial Bank, which was also at a disadvantage due to not being permitted to pay interest on deposits, as the West India Bank did.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=36\u201337}} The two banks pursued opposite strategies, with the Colonial Bank maintaining a conservative stance, including removing currency from circulation,{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=36\u201337}} while the West India Bank pursued aggressive expansion.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=38}} The [[Sugar Duties Act]] of 1846, which equalised the duties on sugar imported into the United Kingdom from the British colonies with that of non-British territories, created a financial crisis in Trinidad and Tobago as the price of sugar fell rapidly.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=39\u201340}} The West India Bank, which had taken on too much risk, went bust during the crisis and the Colonial Bank was also put under strain.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in [[Tobago]] in 1879 and in [[Trinidad]] at around the same period. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in the private sector using dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 [[shilling]]s 2 pence. Local banks also issued their own dollars, however, denominated in dollars.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=102}} Government offices kept their accounts in British pounds, shillings, and pence until the year 1935 when Trinidad and Tobago went decimal. The [[Currency Interpretation Ordinance]] of 1934 replaced the system of pounds, shillings and pence with the dollar, retaining the fixed exchange rate of 1 dollar for every 4 shillings 2 pence.{{sfn|Brown|1989|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nFrom 1949, with the introduction of the [[British West Indies dollar]], the currency of Trinidad and Tobago became officially tied up with that of the British [[Eastern Caribbean]] territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. In 1951, notes of the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group, were introduced, replacing Trinidad and Tobago's own notes. In 1955, coins were introduced when the dollar was decimalized.\n\nThe currency of the union was replaced by the modern Trinidad and Tobago dollar in 1964,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071315/caribbean-currencies-overview.asp |title=Caribbean Currencies: An Overview |author=Warren Cassell Jr. |work=[[Investopedia]]}}</ref> two years after the nation's independence in 1962.<ref name=\"CentralBank\"/> The Trinidad and Tobago dollar was launched, and had become the sole currency by 1967.<ref name=\"CentralBank\">{{cite web |url=https://www.central-bank.org.tt/currency/about-notes-and-coins/history-money-trinidad-tobago |title=History of Money in Trinidad and Tobago |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=[[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]]}}</ref>\n In 1964, Trinidad and Tobago introduced its own dollar.

A large sized $1 coin was first released for circulation in 1969 and again in 1979 before being replaced with a smaller sized version in 1995 more regularly minted. The 5\u00a2 is struck in bronze, with the other denominations in [[cupro-nickel]]. The obverses all feature Trinidad and Tobago's [[coat of arms]], with the reverse designs solely featuring the denomination until 1976, when they were replaced by either a [[national bird]] or [[national flower|flower]] in addition to the denomination after the declaration of a republic. The 50\u00a2 & $1 coins are scarcely seen in circulation, but can be purchased from banks if requested.\n\nThere are also coins minted in $5, $10, $100 and $200 denominations as well. These coins are not in circulation, and can only be obtained from the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, either as part of a special 'eight-coin proof set' collection (in the case of the $5 and $10 coins) or individually (in the case of the $100 and $200 coins.) Notably, the $5 and $10 coins are minted in sterling [[silver]], whereas the $100 and $200 are minted in [[gold]]. The price of the gold coins fluctuate depending on the current state of the market for gold.\n\nIn 2014 the government stopped minting the 1\u00a2 coin. On 3 July 2018 [[cash rounding]] was implemented as 1\u00a2 coins ceased being legal tender for cash payments, but the Central Bank will redeem them indefinitely in multiples of 5\u00a2.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.central-bank.org.tt/sites/default/files/page-file-uploads/Legal%20Notice%20No.%2035%20of%202018.pdf | title=The Central Bank Act, Chap. 79:02 | publisher=Central-Bank.org.tt | accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n== Banknotes ==\n\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = TRI&TOB-1b-Trinidad & Tobago-1 Dollar (1905).jpg|bSize = 250|cWidth = 250|cHeight = 120|oTop = 0|oLeft = 0|Location = right|Description = First government issue one-dollar note (1905).}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the British gold sovereign was valued at four Spanish silver dollars and eighty cents. When the sterling coinage was finally accepted as the main circulating coinage in the British West Indies, the Eastern Caribbean colonies continued nevertheless to use the dollar unit for accounting purposes. The West Indian dollar was therefore equivalent to four shillings and two pence.\n\nThis Royal Bank of Canada note reflects this state of affairs with its overt mention of the fact that one hundred dollars is equal to twenty pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight pence sterling. This state of affairs was exclusively confined to the Eastern Caribbean region, possibly due to the geographical proximity to British Guiana. British Guiana had a reason to wish to retain the dollar unit owing to its recent changeover from Dutch currency. These factors did not affect Jamaica, Bermuda, or the Bahamas which adopted the sterling currency in both coinage and as the unit of account.\n\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = TRI&TOB-2b-Trinidad & Tobago-2 Dollars (1905).jpg|bSize = 250|cWidth = 250|cHeight = 134|oTop = 0|oLeft = 0|Location = right|Description =First government issue two-dollar note (1905).}}\n\nIn 1898, the Colonial Bank introduced $20 notes. These were followed in 1901 by $5. $100 notes were also issued. The last notes were issued in 1926, after which the Colonial Bank was taken over by [[Barclays Bank]], which issued $5, $20 & $100 notes until 1941. In 1905, notes were introduced by the government in denominations of $1 & $2, followed by $5 in 1935, followed by $10 & $20 in 1942.\n\nThe [[Royal Bank of Canada]] introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1909. From 1920, the notes also bore the denomination in sterling. 100-dollar notes were not issued after 1920, whilst the $5 and $20 were issued until 1938. The [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]] introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1921, with the $5 & $20 notes issued until 1939. The Royal Bank of Canada one hundred dollar note, shown here; is a relic of a monetary system, in which the unit of account was related to the circulating coinage on the basis of two historical coins which were no longer in use.\n\n[[File:Trinidad and Tobago 100 Dollars banknote of 1964.jpg|thumb|Trinidad and Tobago 100 Dollars banknote of 1964]]\n\nOn 14 December 1964, the [[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]] introduced notes for $1, $5, $10 & $20.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Linzmayer | first1 = Owen | title = The Banknote Book | chapter = Trinidad and Tobago | publisher = www.BanknoteNews.com | year = 2012 | location = San Francisco, CA | chapter-url = http://www.banknotebook.com}}</ref> New denominations in the form of $50 & $100 notes were issued on 6 June 1977, although the $50 note was not continued after a shipment was stolen prior to issue.

The obverses have the coat of arms in the center, a national bird and a place in Trinidad, such as a market, petroleum refinery, etc. In 2002, new $1 & $20 notes were introduced. In 2003, new $1, $5, $10 & $100 were also introduced. The notes were only slightly changed; they now have more security features & darker colour. Recently, more security features have been added to the notes by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.
