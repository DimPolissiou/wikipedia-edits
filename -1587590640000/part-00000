{"title_page": "Keep on Jumpin'", "text_new": "{{short description|1978 single by Musique}}\n\"'''Keep on Jumpin''''\" is the name of a popular 1970s disco song that was written by musician [[Patrick Adams (musician)|Patrick Adams]] and Ken Morris. This track has been remade, remixed, and sampled numerous times, but only the 1978 original by Adams's group [[Musique (Patrick Adams)|Musique]] and Todd Terry's 1996 updated version with [[Martha Wash]] & [[Jocelyn Brown]] (who was also a member of Musique) reached number one on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] [[Hot Dance Club Play]] charts. Musicians on the tracks include Rich Tannenbaum on drums, Ken Mazur on guitar, and Norbert Sloley on bass. Listed here are the most notable versions.\n\n==Original recording by Musique==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Keep on Jumpin'\n| cover      = Keep_on_Jumpin'.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Musique (Patrick Adams)|Musique]]\n| album      = Keep on Jumpin'\n| A-side     = In the Bush\n| released   = 1978\n| format     = {{flatlist|\n*[[Gramophone record|7\"]]\n*[[12 inch single|12\"]]}}\n| recorded   = 1977\u201378\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Disco]]\n| length     = 5:46\n| label      = [[Prelude Records (record label)|Prelude]]\n| writer     = {{flatlist|\n*[[Patrick Adams (musician)|Patrick Adams]]\n*Ken Morris}}\n| producer   = Patrick Adams\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = In the Bush\n| next_year  = 1978\n}}\n\nThe original version was recorded in late-1977 by the American disco act [[Patrick Adams (musician)|Musique]], who took it to number one on Billboard's [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Disco Songs]] chart as the double-side to \"In the Bush\", the latter being the act's more popular single. The song crossed over to the urban market and peaked at #81 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|Hot Soul Songs]] chart. At the time the single was released, there were questions about its lyrics, which made references to drug use even though it was about having a good time partying the night away. The original is still considered a disco classic to this day and was featured on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'' in the 1979 episode \"Disco Queen.\"\n\n===Track listing===\n;US 12' Version, 45 RPM<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/release/225320 From e.discogs]</ref>\n*A   \"In the Bush\" (8:07)\n*B   \"Keep on Jumpin'\" (5:46)\n{{clear}}\n\n==Beatbox version==\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Keep on Jumpin'\n| cover      = Keep_on_Jumpin'_1991.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = Beatboxx\n| album      =\n| released   = 1991\n| format     = [[Gramophone record|12\"]]\n| recorded   = 1991\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[House music|House]]\n| length     = 3:25\n| label      = [[Strictly Rhythm Records]]\n| writer     = {{flatlist|\n*[[Patrick Adams (musician)|Patrick Adams]]\n*Ken Morris}}\n| producer   = [[Roger Sanchez]]<br>Frank Jefferson\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nIn 1991, [[Roger Sanchez|Roger S]] and Frank Jefferson (AKA Sinister Frank J), under the project name '''Beatboxx''', recorded a techno/house/rave version.

This version was house oriented and the more popular of the \"Keep on Jumpin'\" versions, based on strength and vocal ability of Wash and Brown alone.

As early as 1943, there had arisen in the General Assembly a movement to close the institution, which  eventually culminated in the ''Marbury Report''.<ref name=Hall-of-fame/>  \nThe end of World War II brought a drastic change in the college's environment. In 1946, enrollment increased to 274 students, many being admitted under the new [[G.I. Bill]]. Though the movement to close the college persisted, it seemed misguided to those on the scene and was roundly opposed by both private citizens and civic groups in Frostburg and Western Maryland. With the strong support of State Superintendent of Schools [[Thomas G. Pullen|Thomas Granville Pullen, Jr.]] and Governor [[William Preston Lane Jr.]], the General Assembly was petitioned to keep the School open and the Marbury Commission's recommendations died without ever being acted upon.<ref name=Hall-of-fame/> In 1947, the [[American Council on Education]] suggested that Frostburg State Teachers College be closed.<ref name=Marbury-report>{{cite book|last=American Council on Education|title=Higher education in Maryland; a report of a survey with recommendations of the Maryland Commission on Higher Education, 1947|year=1947|publisher=Maryland State Government|location=Maryland|page=364}}</ref> The report states:\n\n<blockquote>Your Commission does feel obligated to recommend the prompt discontinuance of the State Teachers College at Frostburg. We are convinced that the cost of operating this unit is not justified by the very small number of its graduates who are entering the school system of the state as teachers. In reaching this conclusion, we have been strongly influenced by the report of our survey staff as to the present condition of the physical facilities at Frostburg. It is apparent that the state faces a heavy capital expenditure if operations at that location are to be continued. Frankly, such an outlay seems to us to be an indefensible waste of public money ... The facilities in Towson are adequate to care for all the students at Frostburg who are now studying to become teachers.<ref name=Marbury-report /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:The center of Frostburg campus.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Frostburg State University campus]]\nUnder Compton's leadership, the institution celebrated its 50th anniversary in the 1949-1950 academic year, enrollment grew from 62 students in 1945 to 500 in 1954, the faculty increased from 13 to 34 members, and the size of the campus increased from eight to 40 acres of land. In addition to plant expansion, she initiated programs in curriculum development, adding a program to train junior high school teachers.<ref name=Hall-of-fame/> R. Bowen Hardesty replaced Compton as President in 1955.<ref name=mm />\nThe continued southern expansion of the college caused the Brownsville Schools and homes along Park Avenue to be demolished by 1955 to make way for Compton, Allen, and Simpson Halls. A new school-also known as the Lincoln School, and the current home of the University's Public Safety office-was constructed in the late 1950s. However, the building was used for only two years until national integration laws reassigned students to other Frostburg elementary schools.<ref name=Brownsville /> Marking a shift in the educational mission of the institution, the college was granted the right to grant bachelor of arts degrees and the master of education degree in 1960.<ref name=\"frostburg.edu\"/>\nThe school was again renamed in July 1963, this time as Frostburg State College.

As early as 1943, there had arisen in the General Assembly a movement to close the institution, which  eventually culminated in the ''Marbury Report''.<ref name=Hall-of-fame/>  \nThe end of World War II brought a drastic change in the college's environment. In 1946, enrollment increased to 274 students, many being admitted under the new [[G.I. Bill]]. Though the movement to close the college persisted, it seemed misguided to those on the scene and was roundly opposed by both private citizens and civic groups in Frostburg and Western Maryland. With the strong support of State Superintendent of Schools [[Thomas G. Pullen|Thomas Granville Pullen, Jr.]] and Governor [[William Preston Lane Jr.]], the General Assembly was petitioned to keep the School open and the Marbury Commission's recommendations died without ever being acted upon.<ref name=Hall-of-fame/> In 1947, the [[American Council on Education]] suggested that Frostburg State Teachers College be closed.<ref name=Marbury-report>{{cite book|last=American Council on Education|title=Higher education in Maryland; a report of a survey with recommendations of the Maryland Commission on Higher Education, 1947|year=1947|publisher=Maryland State Government|location=Maryland|page=364}}</ref> The report states:\n\n<blockquote>Your Commission does feel obligated to recommend the prompt discontinuance of the State Teachers College at Frostburg. We are convinced that the cost of operating this unit is not justified by the very small number of its graduates who are entering the school system of the state as teachers. In reaching this conclusion, we have been strongly influenced by the report of our survey staff as to the present condition of the physical facilities at Frostburg. It is apparent that the state faces a heavy capital expenditure if operations at that location are to be continued. Frankly, such an outlay seems to us to be an indefensible waste of public money ... The facilities in Towson are adequate to care for all the students at Frostburg who are now studying to become teachers.<ref name=Marbury-report /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:The center of Frostburg campus.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Frostburg State University campus]]\nUnder Compton's leadership, the institution celebrated its 50th anniversary in the 1949-1950 academic year, enrollment grew from 62 students in 1945 to 500 in 1954, the faculty increased from 13 to 34 members, and the size of the campus increased from eight to 40 acres of land. In addition to plant expansion, she initiated programs in curriculum development, adding a program to train junior high school teachers.<ref name=Hall-of-fame/> R. Bowen Hardesty replaced Compton as President in 1955.<ref name=mm />\nThe continued southern expansion of the college caused the Brownsville Schools and homes along Park Avenue to be demolished by 1955 to make way for Compton, Allen, and Simpson Halls. A new school-also known as the Lincoln School, and the current home of the University's Public Safety office-was constructed in the late 1950s. However, the building was used for only two years until national integration laws reassigned students to other Frostburg elementary schools.<ref name=Brownsville /> Marking a shift in the educational mission of the institution, the college was granted the right to grant bachelor of arts degrees and the master of education degree in 1960.<ref name=\"frostburg.edu\"/>\nThe school was again renamed in July 1963, this time as Frostburg State College. Frostburg received university status in July 1987, thus being renamed to what it is today, i.e. Frostburg State University.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frostburg.edu/about/history.htm|publisher=Frostburg State University|title=History of the University}}</ref> Continuing the shift and growth of the university, the institution opened a campus in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] in 1988, which became the [[University System of Maryland at Hagerstown]] in January 2005, and offered its first doctoral degree in 2012.<ref name=\"frostburg.edu\"/>\n\n=== Presidents ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The earlier, \"unofficial\" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China. The middle part of the period, from 220 to 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states of Wei, Shu, and Wu. The later part of the era was marked by the [[conquest of Shu by Wei]] (263), the usurpation of Wei by the Jin dynasty (266), and the conquest of Wu by the Jin (280).\n\nThe Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A nationwide census taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era.<ref>Nicola Di Cosmo and Robin D.

It has been celebrated and popularized in operas, folk stories, novels and in more recent times, films, television, and video games. The best known of these is [[Luo Guanzhong]]'s ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a [[Ming dynasty]] historical novel based on events in the Three Kingdoms period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Romance of the Three Kingdoms: China's Greatest Epic \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u6f14\u7fa9|url=http://www.yellowbridge.com/literature/threekingdoms.php|website=Yellow Bridge|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> The authoritative historical record of the era is [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', along with [[Pei Songzhi]]'s later [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms|annotations of the text]].\n\nThe English-language term \"Three Kingdoms\" is something of a misnomer, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed [[suzerainty]] over all China.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Harold Miles|title=China: A History|date=13 March 2009|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing Company|Hackett Publishing]]|location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]]|isbn=978-0872209152|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref> Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among English-speaking [[Sinology|sinologist]]s.\n\n==Periodization==\n{{see also|Timeline of the Three Kingdoms period}}\n\nThere is no set time period for the era. Strictly speaking, the Three Kingdoms, or independent states, only existed from 229 with the proclamation of the  [[Eastern Wu]] ruler as emperor until the downfall of [[Shu Han]] in 266. Another interpretation of the period is that it began with the decline of the Han royal house. According to [[Mao Zonggang]], a commentator on the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in his commentary on Chapter 120 of the novel:\n\n{{quote|The three kingdoms formed when the Han royal house declined. The Han royal house declined when the eunuchs abused the sovereign and officials subverted the government.<ref name=\"roberts\">{{cite book |first=Moss |last=Roberts | title=Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_kingdoms.html?id=Sc-shy_ZOMkC | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-520-22503-1}}</ref>}}\n\nMao Zonggang suggests that the historiography of the Three Kingdoms began with the rise of the [[Ten Eunuchs]]. He further argues that the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' defines the end of the era as 280, the downfall of Wu, justifying:\n\n{{quote|As the novel focuses on Han, it could have ended with the fall of Han. But Wei usurped Han. To end the tale before Han's enemy had itself met its fate would be to leave the reader unsatisfied. The novel could have ended with the fall of Wei, but Han's ally was Wu.

A series of Han emperors ascended the throne while still youths, and ''de facto'' imperial power often rested with the emperors' older relatives. As these relatives occasionally were loath to give up their influence, emperors would, upon reaching maturity, be forced to rely on political alliances with senior officials and [[eunuch]]s to achieve control of the government. Political posturing and infighting between imperial relatives and eunuch officials was a constant problem in Chinese government at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Theobald|first1=Ulrich|title=The Yellow Turban Uprising|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/huangjin.html|website=Chinaknowledge|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=28 June 2011|quote=The reasons for the uprising are to be sought in the aggravating economic situation for many peasants. Endebted to rich landowners, peasants could often only survive when selling their land and becoming tenant farmers. Additionally to the high rent for the fields the worked, tenant farmers had to deliver corv\u00e9e labour for their master and had to serve for all kinds of means, often as soldiers for small private armies. A further problem was that the central government was very weak after the death of Emperor He \u6f22\u548c\u5e1d (r. 88\u2013105). Only children or very young persons were enthroned, and the factual politics lay in the hands of the empresses and their families, or those of eunuchs. Taxes were often not sufficient to cover the expenses of the government. Local officials were not correctly appointed, offices were sold, and the local governments did not care for a regular administration. This was especially to be seen in the missing administration of the state granaries. In case of drought or natural disasters, there were no means of relief to be delivered to the hungry population. Peasants left their lands and wandered around in search for food and labour.}}</ref> During the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] (r. 146\u2013168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] (r. 168\u2013189), leading officials' dissatisfaction with the eunuchs' usurpations of power reached a peak, and many began to openly protest against them. The first and second protests met with failure, and the court eunuchs persuaded the emperor to execute many of the protesting scholars. Some local rulers seized the opportunity to exert despotic control over their lands and citizens, since many feared to speak out in the oppressive political climate. Emperors Huan and Ling's reigns were recorded as particularly dark periods of Han dynasty rule. In addition to political oppression and mismanagement, China experienced a number of natural disasters during this period, and local rebellions sprung up throughout the country.\n\nIn the third month of 184, [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]], leader of the Way of Supreme Peace, a [[Taoism|Taoist]] movement, along with his two brothers Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, led the movement's followers in a rebellion against the government that was called the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]]. Their movement quickly attracted followers and soon numbered several hundred thousand and received support from many parts of China. They had 36 bases throughout China, with large bases having 10,000 or more followers and minor bases having 6,000 to 7,000, similar to Han armies. Their motto was: <blockquote>\"The [[firmament]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Referring to the Han dynasty government}} has perished, the Yellow Sky{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Referring to the Yellow Turban Rebellion}} will soon rise; in this year of ''[[Chinese calendar|jiazi]]'', let there be prosperity in the world!\"<br />({{lang|zh-hant|\u84bc\u5929\u5df2\u6b7b\uff0c\u9ec3\u5929\u7576\u7acb\u3002\u6b72\u5728\u7532\u5b50\uff0c\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u5409\u3002}}){{refn|group=lower-alpha|''[[Book of Han]]'' \u2013 ''Record of Emperor Xiaoling'' and the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' -''Guanghe Year 6'' record that Zhang Jiao declared himself Yellow Emperor and took their movement's name from a headscarf worn by followers [yellow signifying the Yellow Emperor and imperial authority].}}</blockquote> Emperor Ling dispatched generals [[Huangfu Song]], [[Lu Zhi (Han dynasty)|Lu Zhi]], and [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] to lead the Han armies against the rebels, and decreed that local governments had to supply soldiers to assist in their efforts. It is at this point that the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' begins its narrative. The Yellow Turbans were ultimately defeated and its surviving followers dispersed throughout China, but due to the turbulent situation throughout the empire, many were able to survive as bandits in mountainous areas, thus continuing their ability to contribute to the turmoil of the era.\n\nWith the widespread increase in bandits across the Chinese nation, the Han army had no way to repel each and every raiding party. In 188, Emperor Ling accepted a memorial from [[Liu Yan (Han dynasty warlord)|Liu Yan]] suggesting he grant direct administrative power over feudal provinces and direct command of regional military to local governors, as well as promoting them in rank and filling such positions with members of the Liu family or court officials. This move made [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]] (''zhou'') official administrative units, and although they had power to combat rebellions, the later intragovernmental chaos allowed these local governors to easily rule independently of the central government. Liu Yan was also promoted as governor of [[Yi Province]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Roughly covering the [[Sichuan Basin]]}}. Soon after this move, Liu Yan severed all of his region's ties to the Han imperial court, and several other areas followed suit.\n\n===Dong Zhuo in power===\n\nIn the same year, Emperor Ling died, and another struggle began between the court eunuchs for control of the imperial family. Court eunuch [[Jian Shuo]] planned to kill General-in-Chief [[He Jin]], a relative of the imperial family, and to replace the [[crown prince]] [[Liu Bian]] with his younger brother [[Emperor Xian of Han|Liu Xie]], the Prince of Chenliu (in present-day [[Kaifeng]]), though his plan was unsuccessful. Liu Bian took the Han throne as Emperor Shao, and He Jin plotted with warlord [[Yuan Shao]] to assassinate the [[Ten Attendants]], a clique of twelve eunuchs led by [[Zhang Rang]] who controlled much of the imperial court. He Jin also ordered [[Dong Zhuo]], the frontier general in Liang Province, and [[Ding Yuan]], Inspector of Bing Province,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The area between present-day [[Baoding]] and [[Taiyuan]]}} to bring troops to the capital to reinforce his position of authority. The eunuchs learned of He Jin's plot, and had him assassinated before Dong Zhuo reached the capital [[Luoyang]]. When Yuan Shao's troops reached Luoyang, they stormed the palace complex, killing the Ten Attendants and 2,000 of the eunuchs' supporters. Though this move effectively ended the century-long feud between the eunuchs and the imperial family, this event prompted the invitation of Dong Zhuo to the outskirts of Luoyang from the northwest boundary of China.\n\nOn the evening of 24 September 189, General Dong Zhuo observed that Luoyang was set ablaze\u2014as a result of a power struggle between the eunuchs and civil service\u2014and commanded his army forward to strike down the disorder.<ref name=cres91-1/> As the emperor had lost any remaining military or political power, Dong Zhuo seized the ''de facto'' control of the government located at Luoyang.<ref name=cres91-1>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=1}}.</ref> On 28 September, Dong Zhuo deposed Liu Bian from the imperial Han throne in favor of Liu Xie.<ref name=cres91-1/> In the following weeks, rebellions broke out throughout all of China.<ref name=cres91-1-2/>\n\nIn East China, in an attempt to restore the power of the Han, a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|large coalition against Dong Zhuo]] began to rise, with leaders such as Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, and Cao Cao.<ref name=cres91-1-2>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=1\u20132}}.</ref> Many provincial officials were compelled to join or risk elimination.<ref name=cres91-2>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=2}}.</ref> In 191, Sun Jian (Yuan Shu's subordinate) led an army against Dong Zhuo and drove him from Luoyang to Chang'an.<ref name=\"cres91-2-3\"/> In the following year (192), [[L\u00fc Bu]], Dong Zhuo's former bodyguard, assassinated Dong Zhuo.<ref name=cres91-2/>\n\n=== Collapse of central power ===\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|Warlords in the 190s]]\nIn 192, there was some talk among the coalition of appointing [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]], an imperial relative, as emperor, and gradually its members began to fall out. Most of the warlords in the coalition, with a few exceptions, sought the increase of personal military power in the time of instability instead of seriously wishing to restore the Han dynasty's authority. The Han empire was divided between a number of regional warlords. As a result of the complete collapse of the central government and eastern alliance, the North China Plain fell into warfare and anarchy with many contenders vying for success or survival.<ref name=cres91-2/> [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] fell into the hands of various warlords in Chang'an.\n\nDong Zhuo, confident in his success, was slain by his follower [[L\u00fc Bu]], who plotted with minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]]. L\u00fc Bu, in turn, was [[Battle of Chang'an|attacked by Dong Zhuo's former officers]]: [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]], [[Zhang Ji (Han dynasty)|Zhang Ji]] and [[Fan Chou]]. Wang Yun and his whole family were executed. L\u00fc Bu fled to [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]], a northern warlord, and remained with him for a time before briefly joining Yuan Shao, but it was clear that L\u00fc Bu was far too independent to serve another.\n\nYuan Shao operated from Ye city in Ji Province, extending his power north of the Yellow River.<ref name=cres91-2/> Han Fu had formerly been the Governor of Ji Province, but he came under the control of Yuan Shao and was replaced by him.<ref name=cres91-2-3>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=2\u20133}}.</ref>\n\nBetween the Yellow and Huai rivers, a conflict had erupted between Yuan Shu, Cao Cao, Tao Qian (Governor of Xu Province), L\u00fc Bu, and Liu Bei (a man with a poor background who claimed imperial descent).<ref name=cres91-2/> Cao Cao forced the Yellow Turbans to surrender in 192,<ref name=\"Crespigny 1991 loc=3\u20134\">{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=3\u20134}}.</ref> drove Yuan Shu to the south of the Huai River in 193,<ref name=cres91-2/> inflicted devastation upon Tao Qian in 194,<ref name=cres91-2-3/> received the surrender of Liu Bei in 196,<ref name=cres91-3>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=3}}.</ref> and captured and executed L\u00fc Bu in 198.<ref name=cres91-3/> Cao was now in complete control of the southern part of the North China Plain.<ref name=cres91-3/>\n\nIn the northeast, [[Gongsun Du]] held control of southern Manchuria, where he had established a state.<ref name=cres91-6/> He was succeeded by his son [[Gongsun Kang]] in 204.<ref name=cres91-6/> In the north across the frontier, since the fall of imperial control, the region had become chaotic as the Xiongnu remnants came into conflict with the Xianbei.<ref name=cres91-6>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=6}}.</ref>[[Goguryeo]] was invaded by warlord [[Gongsun Kang]] in 204, resulting in the [[Daifang Commandery]].

Tao Qian received the support of [[Liu Bei]] and Gongsun Zan, but even then it seemed as if Cao Cao's superior forces would overrun Xu Province entirely. Cao Cao received word that [[L\u00fc Bu]] had seized Yan Province in his absence, and accordingly he retreated, putting a halt to hostilities with Tao Qian for the time being. Tao Qian died in the same year, leaving his province to Liu Bei. A year later, in 195, Cao Cao managed to drive L\u00fc Bu out of Yan Province. L\u00fc Bu fled to Xu Province and was received by Liu Bei, and an uneasy alliance began between the two.\n\nAfterwards, L\u00fc Bu betrayed Liu Bei and seized Xu Province, forming an alliance with Yuan Shu's remnant forces. Liu Bei, together with his followers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], fled to Cao Cao, who accepted him. Soon, preparations were made for an attack on L\u00fc Bu, and the combined forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei invaded Xu Province. L\u00fc Bu's men deserted him, Yuan Shu's forces never arrived as reinforcements, and he was bound by his own subordinates Song Xian (\u5b8b\u61b2) and Wei Xu (\u9b4f\u7e8c) and executed on Cao Cao's order.\n\n====Huai River====\n{{Main|Campaign against Yuan Shu}}\n\nYuan Shu, after being driven south in 193, established himself at his new capital Shouchun (present-day Anhui).<ref name=cres91-3/> He attempted to regain lost territory north of the Huai River.<ref name=cres91-3/> In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor of his own dynasty.<ref name=cres91-3/> The move was a strategic blunder, as it drew the ire of many warlords across the land, including Yuan Shu's own subordinates who almost all abandoned him.<ref name=\"Crespigny 1991 loc=3\u20134\"/> Abandoned by almost all his allies and followers, he perished in 199.<ref name=cres91-4>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=4}}.</ref>\n\n====Emperor Xian's fate====\n\nIn August 195, Emperor Xian fled the tyranny of Li Jue at Chang'an and made a year long hazardous journey east in search of supporters. In 196, Emperor Xian came under the protection and control of Cao Cao after he had succeeded in fleeing from the warlords of Chang'an.<ref name=cres91-4/> Establishing the imperial court at [[Xuchang]] in Henan, Cao Cao\u2014who now held the ''de facto'' control\u2014rigorously followed the formalities of the court and justified his actions as a loyal minister of the Han.<ref name=cres91-4/> By then, most of the smaller contenders for power had either been absorbed by larger ones or destroyed. This was an extremely important move for Cao Cao following the suggestion from his primary adviser, [[Xun Yu]], commenting that by supporting the authentic emperor, Cao Cao would have the formal legal authority to control the other warlords and force them to comply in order to restore the Han dynasty.\n\n====North China Plain====\n\nCao Cao, whose zone of control was the precursor to the state of Cao Wei, had raised an army in 189. In several strategic movements and battles, he controlled Yan Province and defeated several factions of the Yellow Turban rebels. This earned him the aid of other local militaries controlled by [[Zhang Miao]] and [[Chen Gong]], who joined his cause to create his first sizable army. He continued the effort and absorbed approximately 300,000 Yellow Turban rebels into his army as well as a number of clan-based military groups from the eastern side of Qing Province.\n\nSince 192, He developed military agricultural colonies (''[[tuntian]]'') to support his army. Although the system imposed a heavy tax on hired civilian farmers (40% to 60% of agricultural production), the farmers were more than pleased to be able to work with relative stability and professional military protection in a time of chaos. This was later said to be his second important policy for success.\n\nIn 200, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the [[Battle of Guandu]] (near present-day Kaifeng).<ref name=cres91-4/> Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao.<ref name=cres91-4/> Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.<ref name=cres91-4/>\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and

empire. [[Liu Biao]]'s son [[Liu Cong (Han dynasty)|Liu Cong]] surrendered [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] and Cao was able to capture a sizable fleet at Jiangling. [[Sun Quan]], the successor to [[Sun Ce]] in the lower [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], continued to resist. His advisor [[Lu Su]] secured an alliance with [[Liu Bei]], himself a recent refugee from the north, and [[Zhou Yu]] was placed in command of Sun Quan's navy, along with a veteran general who served the Sun family, [[Cheng Pu]]. Their combined armies of 50,000 met Cao Cao's fleet and 200,000-strong force at [[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]] that winter. After an initial skirmish, an attack beginning with a plan to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet was set in motion to lead to the decisive defeat of Cao Cao, forcing him to retreat in disarray back to the north.

From 224 to 225, during his southward campaigns, Zhuge Liang conquered the southern territories up to [[Lake Dian]] in Yunnan.<ref name=cres91-22/>\n\nIn 227, Zhuge Liang transferred his main Shu armies to [[Hanzhong]], and opened up the battle for the northwest with Wei. The next year, he ordered [[Zhao Yun]] to attack from Ji Gorge as a diversion while Zhuge himself led the main force to Mount Qi. The vanguard [[Ma Su]] suffered a tactical defeat at [[Battle of Jieting|Jieting]] and the Shu army was forced to withdraw. In the next six years Zhuge Liang attempted several more offensives, but supply problems limited the capacity for success. In 234, he led his last great northern offensive, reaching the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] south of the [[Wei River]]. Due to the death of Zhuge Liang in 234, the Shu army was forced once again to withdraw, but were pursued by Wei. The Shu forces began to withdraw; [[Sima Yi]] deduced Zhuge Liang's demise and ordered an attack. Shu struck back almost immediately, causing Sima Yi to second guess and allow Shu to withdraw successfully.\n\n====Wu====\n{{main|Eastern Wu}}\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign.png|thumb|[[Zhuge Liang]]'s Southern Campaign]]\n\n[[Sun Quan]] turned to the aborigines of the southeast, whom the Chinese collectively called the \"[[Baiyue|Shanyue]]\". A collection of successes against the rebellious tribesmen culminated in the victory of 224. In that year, [[Zhuge Ke]] ended a three-year siege of Danyang with the surrender of 100,000 Shanyue. Of these, 40,000 were drafted as auxiliaries into the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] army. Meanwhile, Shu was also experiencing troubles with the indigenous tribes of their south. The southwestern [[Nanman]] peoples rose in revolt against Shu authority, captured and looted cities in Yi Province. Zhuge Liang, recognizing the importance of stability in the south, ordered the advance of the Shu armies in three columns against the Nanman. He fought a number of engagements against the chieftain [[Meng Huo]], at the end of which Meng Huo submitted. A tribesman was allowed to reside at the Shu capital [[Chengdu]] as an official and the Nanman formed their own battalions within the Shu army.\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang 1st and 2nd Northern Expeditions.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's first and second northern expeditions against [[Cao Wei]]]]\n[[File:Zhuge Liang 3rd Northern Expedition.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's third northern expedition against Cao Wei]]\n[[File:Zhuge Liang 4th and 5th Northern Expeditions.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's fourth and fifth northern expeditions against Cao Wei]]\n\nIn the times of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s northern offensives, the state of Wu had always been on the defensive against invasions from the north. The area around [[Hefei]] was the scene of many bitter battles and under constant pressure from Wei after the Battle of Red Cliffs. Warfare had grown so intense that many of the residents chose to migrate and resettle south of the [[Yangtze River]]. After Zhuge Liang's death, attacks on the southern [[Huai River]] region intensified but nonetheless, Wei could not break through the line of the river defenses erected by Wu, which included the Ruxu fortress.\n\n[[Sun Quan]]'s long reign is regarded as a time of plenty for his southern state. Migrations from the north and the settlement of the Shanyue increased manpower for agriculture, especially along the lower reaches of the Yangtze and in [[Kuaiji Commandery]] along the southern shore of [[Hangzhou Bay]]. River transport blossomed, with the construction of the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Trade with Shu flourished, with a huge influx of Shu cotton and the development of [[celadon]] and metal industries. Sea journeys were made to [[Manchuria]] and the island of [[Taiwan]]. In the south, Wu merchants reached Linyi (Southern [[Vietnam]]) and [[Funan Kingdom]]. As the economy prospered, so too did the arts and culture. In the Yangtze delta, the first [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influences reached the south from [[Luoyang]].\n\nThe Eastern Wu era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. A [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]) prefect, [[Shi Xie]], ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese emperors.<ref>Taylor, Keith Weller (1 April 1991).

Originally satisfied with [[Eastern Wu]]'s rule, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] opposed [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]]'s rebellion against Eastern Wu and attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[L\u00fc Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Tri\u1ec7u]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi. According to the ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' (Complete Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t), Lady Tri\u1ec7u had long breasts that reached her shoulders and rode into battle on an elephant.

But after 258, Shu politics became increasingly controlled by the [[eunuch]] faction, led by [[Huang Hao]], and corruption rose. Despite the energetic efforts of [[Jiang Wei]], Zhuge Liang's [[protege]], Shu was unable to secure any decisive achievement. In 263, Wei launched a three-pronged attack and the Shu army was forced into general retreat from Hanzhong. Jiang Wei hurriedly held a position at Jiange but he was outflanked by the Wei commander [[Deng Ai]], who force-marched his army from Yinping through territory formerly considered impassable. By the winter of the year, the capital [[Chengdu]] fell due to the strategic invasion of Wei by Deng Ai who invaded Chengdu personally. The emperor [[Liu Shan]] thus surrendered. The state of Shu had come to an end after 43 years. Liu Shan was reinstated to the Wei capital of Luoyang and was given the new title of the \"Duke of Anle\".  Directly translated, it meant the \"Duke of Safety and Happiness\" and was a trivial position with no actual power.\n\n====Fall of Wei====\nFrom the late 230s, tensions began to become visible between the imperial Cao clan and the Sima clan. Following the death of [[Cao Zhen]], factionalism was evident between [[Cao Shuang]] and the Grand Tutor [[Sima Yi]]. In deliberations, Cao Shuang placed his own supporters in important posts and excluded Sima Yi, whom he regarded as a dangerous threat. The power of the Sima clan, one of the great landowning families of the Han dynasty, was bolstered by Sima Yi's military victories. Additionally, Sima Yi was an extremely capable strategist and politician. In 238 he [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|crushed the rebellion]] of [[Gongsun Yuan]] and brought the [[Liaodong]] region directly under central control. Ultimately, he outmaneuvered Cao Shuang in power play. Taking advantage of an excursion by the imperial clansmen to the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|Gaoping Tombs]], Sima Yi undertook a [[putsch]] in Luoyang, forcing Cao Shuang's faction from authority. Many protested against the overwhelming power of the Sima family; notable among these were the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]]. One of the sages, [[Xi Kang]], was executed as part of the purges after Cao Shuang's downfall.\n\n[[Cao Huan]] succeeded to the throne in 260 after [[Cao Mao]] was killed in a failed coup against [[Sima Zhao]]. Soon after, Sima Zhao died and his title as Duke of J\u00ecn was inherited by his son [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]]. Sima Yan immediately began plotting to become emperor but faced stiff opposition. Following advice from his advisors, Cao Huan decided the best course of action would be to abdicate, unlike his predecessor Cao Mao. Sima Yan seized the throne in 266 after forcing Cao Huan's abdication, effectively overthrowing the Wei dynasty and establishing the successor [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]]. This situation was similar to the deposal of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] by [[Cao Pi]] 40 years earlier.\n\n====Fall of Wu====\n{{Main|Conquest of Wu by Jin}}\n\nFollowing [[Sun Quan]]'s death and the ascension of the young [[Sun Liang]] to the throne in 252, the state of Wu went into steady decline. Successful Wei suppression of rebellions in the southern [[Huai River]] region by [[Sima Zhao]] and [[Sima Shi]] reduced any opportunity of Wu influence. The fall of Shu signalled a change in Wei politics. After Liu Shan surrendered to Wei, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] (grandson of Sima Yi), overthrew the Wei emperor and proclaimed his own dynasty of Jin in 266, ending 46 years of Cao dominion in the north. After Jin's rise, emperor [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]] of Wu died, and his ministers gave the throne to [[Sun Hao]]. Sun Hao was a promising young man, but upon ascension he became a tyrant, killing or exiling all who dared oppose him in the court. In 269 [[Yang Hu]], a Jin commander in the south, started preparing for the invasion of Wu by ordering the construction of a fleet and the training of marines in [[Sichuan]] under [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]]. Four years later, [[Lu Kang (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Kang]], the last great general of Wu, died leaving no competent successor. The planned Jin offensive finally came at the end of 279. Sima Yan launched five simultaneous offensives along the [[Yangtze River]] from Jianye (present-day [[Nanjing]]) to Jiangling while the Sichuan fleet sailed downriver to [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. Under the strain of such an enormous attack, the Wu forces collapsed and Jianye fell in the third month of 280. Sun Hao surrendered and was given a fiefdom on which to live out his days. This marked the end of the Three Kingdoms era, and the beginning of a break in the forthcoming 300 years of disunity.\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Population ===\n[[File:Pottery courtyard, 3 kingdoms, Wu, Hubei, 1967.

After his coming to power, [[Dong Zhuo]] gave full swing to his army to loot and plunder the population, and abduct women into forced marriages, servants or consorts. When the Guandong Coalition was starting the campaign against Dong Zhuo, he embarked upon a scorched earth campaign, proclaiming that \"all the population of [[Luoyang]] be forced to move to [[Chang'an]], all the palaces, temples, official residences and homes be burnt, no one should stay within that area of 200 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''\".  Considering the hardships of that time this amounted to a death sentence for many, and cries of discontent rose as the population of Luoyang decreased sharply. When Cao Cao attacked [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]], it was said that \"hundreds of thousands of men and women were buried alive, even dogs and chickens did not survive. The [[Si River]] was blocked. From then on, these five towns never recovered.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  When [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]] and his army were advancing towards the [[Guanzhong]] area, \"there remained hundreds of thousands of people, but Li Jue allowed his army to plunder the cities and the people, thus making the people have nothing but eat each other to death.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe following table shows the severe decrease of population during that period. From the late Eastern Han to the Western Jin dynasty, despite the length of about 125 years, the peak population only equaled 35.3% of the peak population during the Eastern Han dynasty. From the Western Jin dynasty to the [[Sui dynasty]], the population never recovered. High militarization of the population was common. For example, the population of Shu was 900,000, but the military numbered over 100,000. The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' contains population figures for the Three Kingdoms. As with many Chinese historical population figures, these numbers are likely to be less than the actual populations, since census and tax records went hand in hand, and tax evaders were often not on records.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Three Kingdoms Period Populations<ref>From Zou Jiwan ({{zh|c=\u9112\u7d00\u842c|links=no}}), ''Zhongguo Tongshi \u2013 Weijin Nanbeichao Shi'' {{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u901a\u53f2\u00b7\u9b4f\u6649\u5357\u5317\u671d\u53f2}}, (1992).</ref>\n|-\n!

Other factors such as mass famines and diseases, due to the collapse of sustaining governance and migrations out of China must be taken into account.\n\n=== Economy ===\nIn the late Eastern Han dynasty, due to natural disasters and social unrest, the economy was badly depressed, leading to the massive waste of farmland. Some local landlords and aristocracy established their own strongholds to defend themselves and developed agriculture, which gradually evolved into a self-sufficient manorial system. The system of strongholds and manors also had effects on the economical mode of following dynasties. In addition, because of the collapse of the imperial court, those worn copper coins were not melted and reminted and many privately minted coins appeared. In the Three Kingdoms period, newly minted coins never made their way into currency. Due to the collapse of the coinage, Cao Wei officially declared silk cloth and grains as the main currencies in 221.<ref name = ANU>{{cite web|title=The Three Kingdoms and Western Jin: A history of China in the Third Century AD |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/3KWJin.html |last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe |publisher=Australian National University |date=November 2003 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn economic terms the division of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern [[Song dynasty]], 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and [[Sichuan]]). These geographical divisions are underscored by the fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linking north and south, the hauling-way through the [[Three Gorges]] of the [[Yangtze River]] linking southern China with Sichuan and the [[gallery road]]s joining Sichuan with the northwest.

Possibly due to the popularity of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', the Three Kingdoms era is one of the most well-known non-modern Chinese eras in terms of iconic characters, deeds and exploits. This is reflected in the way that fictional accounts of the Three Kingdoms, mostly based on the novel, play a significant role in East Asian popular culture.

The earlier, \"unofficial\" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China. The middle part of the period, from 220 to 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states of Wei, Shu, and Wu. The later part of the era was marked by the [[conquest of Shu by Wei]] (263), the usurpation of Wei by the Jin dynasty (266), and the conquest of Wu by the Jin (280).\n\nThe Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A nationwide census taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era.<ref>Nicola Di Cosmo and Robin D.

It has been celebrated and popularized in operas, folk stories, novels and in more recent times, films, television, and video games. The best known of these is [[Luo Guanzhong]]'s ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a [[Ming dynasty]] historical novel based on events in the Three Kingdoms period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Romance of the Three Kingdoms: China's Greatest Epic \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u6f14\u7fa9|url=http://www.yellowbridge.com/literature/threekingdoms.php|website=Yellow Bridge|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> The authoritative historical record of the era is [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', along with [[Pei Songzhi]]'s later [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms|annotations of the text]].\n\nThe English-language term \"Three Kingdoms\" is something of a misnomer, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed [[suzerainty]] over all China.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Harold Miles|title=China: A History|date=13 March 2009|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing Company|Hackett Publishing]]|location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]]|isbn=978-0872209152|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref> Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among English-speaking [[Sinology|sinologist]]s.\n\n==Periodization==\n{{see also|Timeline of the Three Kingdoms period}}\n\nThere is no set time period for the era. Strictly speaking, the Three Kingdoms, or independent states, only existed from 229 with the proclamation of the  [[Eastern Wu]] ruler as emperor until the downfall of [[Shu Han]] in 266. Another interpretation of the period is that it began with the decline of the Han royal house. According to [[Mao Zonggang]], a commentator on the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in his commentary on Chapter 120 of the novel:\n\n{{quote|The three kingdoms formed when the Han royal house declined. The Han royal house declined when the eunuchs abused the sovereign and officials subverted the government.<ref name=\"roberts\">{{cite book |first=Moss |last=Roberts | title=Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_kingdoms.html?id=Sc-shy_ZOMkC | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-520-22503-1}}</ref>}}\n\nMao Zonggang suggests that the historiography of the Three Kingdoms began with the rise of the [[Ten Eunuchs]]. He further argues that the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' defines the end of the era as 280, the downfall of Wu, justifying:\n\n{{quote|As the novel focuses on Han, it could have ended with the fall of Han.

A series of Han emperors ascended the throne while still youths, and ''de facto'' imperial power often rested with the emperors' older relatives. As these relatives occasionally were loath to give up their influence, emperors would, upon reaching maturity, be forced to rely on political alliances with senior officials and [[eunuch]]s to achieve control of the government. Political posturing and infighting between imperial relatives and eunuch officials was a constant problem in Chinese government at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Theobald|first1=Ulrich|title=The Yellow Turban Uprising|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/huangjin.html|website=Chinaknowledge|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=28 June 2011|quote=The reasons for the uprising are to be sought in the aggravating economic situation for many peasants. Endebted to rich landowners, peasants could often only survive when selling their land and becoming tenant farmers. Additionally to the high rent for the fields the worked, tenant farmers had to deliver corv\u00e9e labour for their master and had to serve for all kinds of means, often as soldiers for small private armies. A further problem was that the central government was very weak after the death of Emperor He \u6f22\u548c\u5e1d (r. 88\u2013105). Only children or very young persons were enthroned, and the factual politics lay in the hands of the empresses and their families, or those of eunuchs. Taxes were often not sufficient to cover the expenses of the government. Local officials were not correctly appointed, offices were sold, and the local governments did not care for a regular administration. This was especially to be seen in the missing administration of the state granaries. In case of drought or natural disasters, there were no means of relief to be delivered to the hungry population. Peasants left their lands and wandered around in search for food and labour.}}</ref> During the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] (r. 146\u2013168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] (r. 168\u2013189), leading officials' dissatisfaction with the eunuchs' usurpations of power reached a peak, and many began to openly protest against them. The first and second protests met with failure, and the court eunuchs persuaded the emperor to execute many of the protesting scholars. Some local rulers seized the opportunity to exert despotic control over their lands and citizens, since many feared to speak out in the oppressive political climate. Emperors Huan and Ling's reigns were recorded as particularly dark periods of Han dynasty rule. In addition to political oppression and mismanagement, China experienced a number of natural disasters during this period, and local rebellions sprung up throughout the country.\n\nIn the third month of 184, [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]], leader of the Way of Supreme Peace, a [[Taoism|Taoist]] movement, along with his two brothers Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, led the movement's followers in a rebellion against the government that was called the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]]. Their movement quickly attracted followers and soon numbered several hundred thousand and received support from many parts of China. They had 36 bases throughout China, with large bases having 10,000 or more followers and minor bases having 6,000 to 7,000, similar to Han armies. Their motto was: <blockquote>\"The [[firmament]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Referring to the Han dynasty government}} has perished, the Yellow Sky{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Referring to the Yellow Turban Rebellion}} will soon rise; in this year of ''[[Chinese calendar|jiazi]]'', let there be prosperity in the world!\"<br />({{lang|zh-hant|\u84bc\u5929\u5df2\u6b7b\uff0c\u9ec3\u5929\u7576\u7acb\u3002\u6b72\u5728\u7532\u5b50\uff0c\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u5409\u3002}}){{refn|group=lower-alpha|''[[Book of Han]]'' \u2013 ''Record of Emperor Xiaoling'' and the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' -''Guanghe Year 6'' record that Zhang Jiao declared himself Yellow Emperor and took their movement's name from a headscarf worn by followers [yellow signifying the Yellow Emperor and imperial authority].}}</blockquote> Emperor Ling dispatched generals [[Huangfu Song]], [[Lu Zhi (Han dynasty)|Lu Zhi]], and [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] to lead the Han armies against the rebels, and decreed that local governments had to supply soldiers to assist in their efforts. It is at this point that the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' begins its narrative. The Yellow Turbans were ultimately defeated and its surviving followers dispersed throughout China, but due to the turbulent situation throughout the empire, many were able to survive as bandits in mountainous areas, thus continuing their ability to contribute to the turmoil of the era.\n\nWith the widespread increase in bandits across the Chinese nation, the Han army had no way to repel each and every raiding party. In 188, Emperor Ling accepted a memorial from [[Liu Yan (Han dynasty warlord)|Liu Yan]] suggesting he grant direct administrative power over feudal provinces and direct command of regional military to local governors, as well as promoting them in rank and filling such positions with members of the Liu family or court officials. This move made [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]] (''zhou'') official administrative units, and although they had power to combat rebellions, the later intragovernmental chaos allowed these local governors to easily rule independently of the central government. Liu Yan was also promoted as governor of [[Yi Province]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Roughly covering the [[Sichuan Basin]]}}. Soon after this move, Liu Yan severed all of his region's ties to the Han imperial court, and several other areas followed suit.\n\n===Dong Zhuo in power===\n\nIn the same year, Emperor Ling died, and another struggle began between the court eunuchs for control of the imperial family. Court eunuch [[Jian Shuo]] planned to kill General-in-Chief [[He Jin]], a relative of the imperial family, and to replace the [[crown prince]] [[Liu Bian]] with his younger brother [[Emperor Xian of Han|Liu Xie]], the Prince of Chenliu (in present-day [[Kaifeng]]), though his plan was unsuccessful. Liu Bian took the Han throne as Emperor Shao, and He Jin plotted with warlord [[Yuan Shao]] to assassinate the [[Ten Attendants]], a clique of twelve eunuchs led by [[Zhang Rang]] who controlled much of the imperial court. He Jin also ordered [[Dong Zhuo]], the frontier general in Liang Province, and [[Ding Yuan]], Inspector of Bing Province,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The area between present-day [[Baoding]] and [[Taiyuan]]}} to bring troops to the capital to reinforce his position of authority. The eunuchs learned of He Jin's plot, and had him assassinated before Dong Zhuo reached the capital [[Luoyang]]. When Yuan Shao's troops reached Luoyang, they stormed the palace complex, killing the Ten Attendants and 2,000 of the eunuchs' supporters. Though this move effectively ended the century-long feud between the eunuchs and the imperial family, this event prompted the invitation of Dong Zhuo to the outskirts of Luoyang from the northwest boundary of China.\n\nOn the evening of 24 September 189, General Dong Zhuo observed that Luoyang was set ablaze\u2014as a result of a power struggle between the eunuchs and civil service\u2014and commanded his army forward to strike down the disorder.<ref name=cres91-1/> As the emperor had lost any remaining military or political power, Dong Zhuo seized the ''de facto'' control of the government located at Luoyang.<ref name=cres91-1>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=1}}.</ref> On 28 September, Dong Zhuo deposed Liu Bian from the imperial Han throne in favor of Liu Xie.<ref name=cres91-1/> In the following weeks, rebellions broke out throughout all of China.<ref name=cres91-1-2/>\n\nIn East China, in an attempt to restore the power of the Han, a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|large coalition against Dong Zhuo]] began to rise, with leaders such as Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, and Cao Cao.<ref name=cres91-1-2>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=1\u20132}}.</ref> Many provincial officials were compelled to join or risk elimination.<ref name=cres91-2>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=2}}.</ref> In 191, Sun Jian (Yuan Shu's subordinate) led an army against Dong Zhuo and drove him from Luoyang to Chang'an.<ref name=\"cres91-2-3\"/> In the following year (192), [[L\u00fc Bu]], Dong Zhuo's former bodyguard, assassinated Dong Zhuo.<ref name=cres91-2/>\n\n=== Collapse of central power ===\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|Warlords in the 190s]]\nIn 192, there was some talk among the coalition of appointing [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]], an imperial relative, as emperor, and gradually its members began to fall out. Most of the warlords in the coalition, with a few exceptions, sought the increase of personal military power in the time of instability instead of seriously wishing to restore the Han dynasty's authority. The Han empire was divided between a number of regional warlords. As a result of the complete collapse of the central government and eastern alliance, the North China Plain fell into warfare and anarchy with many contenders vying for success or survival.<ref name=cres91-2/> [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] fell into the hands of various warlords in Chang'an.\n\nDong Zhuo, confident in his success, was slain by his follower [[L\u00fc Bu]], who plotted with minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]]. L\u00fc Bu, in turn, was [[Battle of Chang'an|attacked by Dong Zhuo's former officers]]: [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]], [[Zhang Ji (Han dynasty)|Zhang Ji]] and [[Fan Chou]]. Wang Yun and his whole family were executed. L\u00fc Bu fled to [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]], a northern warlord, and remained with him for a time before briefly joining Yuan Shao, but it was clear that L\u00fc Bu was far too independent to serve another.\n\nYuan Shao operated from Ye city in Ji Province, extending his power north of the Yellow River.<ref name=cres91-2/> Han Fu had formerly been the Governor of Ji Province, but he came under the control of Yuan Shao and was replaced by him.<ref name=cres91-2-3>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=2\u20133}}.</ref>\n\nBetween the Yellow and Huai rivers, a conflict had erupted between Yuan Shu, Cao Cao, Tao Qian (Governor of Xu Province), L\u00fc Bu, and Liu Bei (a man with a poor background who claimed imperial descent).<ref name=cres91-2/> Cao Cao forced the Yellow Turbans to surrender in 192,<ref name=\"Crespigny 1991 loc=3\u20134\">{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=3\u20134}}.</ref> drove Yuan Shu to the south of the Huai River in 193,<ref name=cres91-2/> inflicted devastation upon Tao Qian in 194,<ref name=cres91-2-3/> received the surrender of Liu Bei in 196,<ref name=cres91-3>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=3}}.</ref> and captured and executed L\u00fc Bu in 198.<ref name=cres91-3/> Cao was now in complete control of the southern part of the North China Plain.<ref name=cres91-3/>\n\nIn the northeast, [[Gongsun Du]] held control of southern Manchuria, where he had established a state.<ref name=cres91-6/> He was succeeded by his son [[Gongsun Kang]] in 204.<ref name=cres91-6/> In the north across the frontier, since the fall of imperial control, the region had become chaotic as the Xiongnu remnants came into conflict with the Xianbei.<ref name=cres91-6>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=6}}.</ref>[[Goguryeo]] was invaded by warlord [[Gongsun Kang]] in 204, resulting in the [[Daifang Commandery]].

Tao Qian received the support of [[Liu Bei]] and Gongsun Zan, but even then it seemed as if Cao Cao's superior forces would overrun Xu Province entirely. Cao Cao received word that [[L\u00fc Bu]] had seized Yan Province in his absence, and accordingly he retreated, putting a halt to hostilities with Tao Qian for the time being. Tao Qian died in the same year, leaving his province to Liu Bei. A year later, in 195, Cao Cao managed to drive L\u00fc Bu out of Yan Province. L\u00fc Bu fled to Xu Province and was received by Liu Bei, and an uneasy alliance began between the two.\n\nAfterwards, L\u00fc Bu betrayed Liu Bei and seized Xu Province, forming an alliance with Yuan Shu's remnant forces. Liu Bei, together with his followers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], fled to Cao Cao, who accepted him. Soon, preparations were made for an attack on L\u00fc Bu, and the combined forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei invaded Xu Province. L\u00fc Bu's men deserted him, Yuan Shu's forces never arrived as reinforcements, and he was bound by his own subordinates Song Xian (\u5b8b\u61b2) and Wei Xu (\u9b4f\u7e8c) and executed on Cao Cao's order.\n\n====Huai River====\n{{Main|Campaign against Yuan Shu}}\n\nYuan Shu, after being driven south in 193, established himself at his new capital Shouchun (present-day Anhui).<ref name=cres91-3/> He attempted to regain lost territory north of the Huai River.<ref name=cres91-3/> In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor of his own dynasty.<ref name=cres91-3/> The move was a strategic blunder, as it drew the ire of many warlords across the land, including Yuan Shu's own subordinates who almost all abandoned him.<ref name=\"Crespigny 1991 loc=3\u20134\"/> Abandoned by almost all his allies and followers, he perished in 199.<ref name=cres91-4>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=4}}.</ref>\n\n====Emperor Xian's fate====\n\nIn August 195, Emperor Xian fled the tyranny of Li Jue at Chang'an and made a year long hazardous journey east in search of supporters. In 196, Emperor Xian came under the protection and control of Cao Cao after he had succeeded in fleeing from the warlords of Chang'an.<ref name=cres91-4/> Establishing the imperial court at [[Xuchang]] in Henan, Cao Cao\u2014who now held the ''de facto'' control\u2014rigorously followed the formalities of the court and justified his actions as a loyal minister of the Han.<ref name=cres91-4/> By then, most of the smaller contenders for power had either been absorbed by larger ones or destroyed. This was an extremely important move for Cao Cao following the suggestion from his primary adviser, [[Xun Yu]], commenting that by supporting the authentic emperor, Cao Cao would have the formal legal authority to control the other warlords and force them to comply in order to restore the Han dynasty.\n\n====North China Plain====\n\nCao Cao, whose zone of control was the precursor to the state of Cao Wei, had raised an army in 189. In several strategic movements and battles, he controlled Yan Province and defeated several factions of the Yellow Turban rebels. This earned him the aid of other local militaries controlled by [[Zhang Miao]] and [[Chen Gong]], who joined his cause to create his first sizable army. He continued the effort and absorbed approximately 300,000 Yellow Turban rebels into his army as well as a number of clan-based military groups from the eastern side of Qing Province.\n\nSince 192, He developed military agricultural colonies (''[[tuntian]]'') to support his army. Although the system imposed a heavy tax on hired civilian farmers (40% to 60% of agricultural production), the farmers were more than pleased to be able to work with relative stability and professional military protection in a time of chaos. This was later said to be his second important policy for success.\n\nIn 200, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the [[Battle of Guandu]] (near present-day Kaifeng).<ref name=cres91-4/> Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao.<ref name=cres91-4/> Due to a raid in

empire. [[Liu Biao]]'s son [[Liu Cong (Han dynasty)|Liu Cong]] surrendered [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] and Cao was able to capture a sizable fleet at Jiangling. [[Sun Quan]], the successor to [[Sun Ce]] in the lower [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], continued to resist. His advisor [[Lu Su]] secured an alliance with [[Liu Bei]], himself a recent refugee from the north, and [[Zhou Yu]] was placed in command of Sun Quan's navy, along with a veteran general who served the Sun family, [[Cheng Pu]]. Their combined armies of 50,000 met Cao Cao's fleet and 200,000-strong force at [[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]] that winter. After an initial skirmish, an attack beginning with a plan to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet was set in motion to lead to the decisive defeat of Cao Cao, forcing him to retreat in disarray back to the north. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, and provided the basis for the states of Shu and Wu.\n\n=== Final years of the dynasty ===\n\nIn 209, Zhou Yu captured Jiangling, establishing the south's complete dominance over the Yangtze River.<ref name=cres91-9/> Meanwhile, Liu Bei and his principal adviser Zhuge Liang captured the [[Xiang River]] basin commandaries, establishing control over the southern territories of Jing province.<ref name=cres91-10>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=10}}.</ref> Sun Quan was forced to cede the territory around Jiangling to Liu Bei, because he could not establish a proper authority over it after Zhou Yu's death in 210.<ref name=cres91-10/>\n\nIn 211, Cao Cao defeated a warlord coalition in the Wei valley, ending in the Battle of Huayin, capturing the territory around Chang'an.<ref name=cres91-10/> In 211, Liu Bei accepted an invitation from Liu Zhang to come to [[Yi Province]] for aiding the latter against a threat from the north, namely Zhang Lu of Hanzhong.<ref name=cres91-lz>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=10\u201311 & 21\u201322}}.</ref> Liu Bei met people within Liu Zhang's court who wished that he would replace Liu Zhang as the ruler of Yi Province.<ref name=cres91-lz/> A year after his arrival, Liu Bei came into conflict with Liu Zhang and turned against him.<ref name=cres91-lz/> In summer of 214, Liu Bei received the surrender of Liu Zhang, capturing Yi Province, and established his regime at Chengdu.<ref name=cres91-lz/> In 215, Cao Cao captured Hanzhong after attacking and receiving the surrender of Zhang Lu.<ref name=cres91-10-1>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991a|loc=10\u201311}}.</ref> He had launched the attack from Chang'an through the Qinling Mountain passes to Hanzhong.<ref name=cres91-10-1/> The conquest threatened Liu Bei's territory located directly to the south.<ref name=cres91-10-1/> Cao Cao progressively increased his titles and power under the puppet Emperor Xian.

From 224 to 225, during his southward campaigns, Zhuge Liang conquered the southern territories up to [[Lake Dian]] in Yunnan.<ref name=cres91-22/>\n\nIn 227, Zhuge Liang transferred his main Shu armies to [[Hanzhong]], and opened up the battle for the northwest with Wei. The next year, he ordered [[Zhao Yun]] to attack from Ji Gorge as a diversion while Zhuge himself led the main force to Mount Qi. The vanguard [[Ma Su]] suffered a tactical defeat at [[Battle of Jieting|Jieting]] and the Shu army was forced to withdraw. In the next six years Zhuge Liang attempted several more offensives, but supply problems limited the capacity for success. In 234, he led his last great northern offensive, reaching the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] south of the [[Wei River]]. Due to the death of Zhuge Liang in 234, the Shu army was forced once again to withdraw, but were pursued by Wei. The Shu forces began to withdraw; [[Sima Yi]] deduced Zhuge Liang's demise and ordered an attack. Shu struck back almost immediately, causing Sima Yi to second guess and allow Shu to withdraw successfully.\n\n====Wu====\n{{main|Eastern Wu}}\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign.png|thumb|[[Zhuge Liang]]'s Southern Campaign]]\n\n[[Sun Quan]] turned to the aborigines of the southeast, whom the Chinese collectively called the \"[[Baiyue|Shanyue]]\". A collection of successes against the rebellious tribesmen culminated in the victory of 224. In that year, [[Zhuge Ke]] ended a three-year siege of Danyang with the surrender of 100,000 Shanyue. Of these, 40,000 were drafted as auxiliaries into the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] army. Meanwhile, Shu was also experiencing troubles with the indigenous tribes of their south. The southwestern [[Nanman]] peoples rose in revolt against Shu authority, captured and looted cities in Yi Province. Zhuge Liang, recognizing the importance of stability in the south, ordered the advance of the Shu armies in three columns against the Nanman. He fought a number of engagements against the chieftain [[Meng Huo]], at the end of which Meng Huo submitted. A tribesman was allowed to reside at the Shu capital [[Chengdu]] as an official and the Nanman formed their own battalions within the Shu army.\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang 1st and 2nd Northern Expeditions.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's first and second northern expeditions against [[Cao Wei]]]]\n[[File:Zhuge Liang 3rd Northern Expedition.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's third northern expedition against Cao Wei]]\n[[File:Zhuge Liang 4th and 5th Northern Expeditions.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's fourth and fifth northern expeditions against Cao Wei]]\n\nIn the times of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s northern offensives, the state of Wu had always been on the defensive against invasions from the north. The area around [[Hefei]] was the scene of many bitter battles and under constant pressure from Wei after the Battle of Red Cliffs. Warfare had grown so intense that many of the residents chose to migrate and resettle south of the [[Yangtze River]]. After Zhuge Liang's death, attacks on the southern [[Huai River]] region intensified but nonetheless, Wei could not break through the line of the river defenses erected by Wu, which included the Ruxu fortress.\n\n[[Sun Quan]]'s long reign is regarded as a time of plenty for his southern state. Migrations from the north and the settlement of the Shanyue increased manpower for agriculture, especially along the lower reaches of the Yangtze and in [[Kuaiji Commandery]] along the southern shore of [[Hangzhou Bay]]. River transport blossomed, with the construction of the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Trade with Shu flourished, with a huge influx of Shu cotton and the development of [[celadon]] and metal industries. Sea journeys were made to [[Manchuria]] and the island of [[Taiwan]]. In the south, Wu merchants reached Linyi (Southern [[Vietnam]]) and [[Funan Kingdom]]. As the economy prospered, so too did the arts and culture. In the Yangtze delta, the first [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influences reached the south from [[Luoyang]].\n\nThe Eastern Wu era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. A [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]) prefect, [[Shi Xie]], ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese emperors.<ref>Taylor, Keith Weller (1 April 1991). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rCl_02LnNVIC&pg=PA70 \"The Birth of Vietnam\"]. University of California Press \u2013 via Google Books.</ref> [[Shi Xie]] pledged loyalty to [[Eastern Wu]]. Originally satisfied with [[Eastern Wu]]'s rule, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] opposed [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]]'s rebellion against Eastern Wu and attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[L\u00fc Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Tri\u1ec7u]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi. According to the ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' (Complete Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t), Lady Tri\u1ec7u had long breasts that reached her shoulders and rode into battle on an elephant. After several months of warfare she was defeated and committed suicide.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n====Wei====\n{{main|Cao Wei}}\n\nIn 226, Cao Pi died (aged 40) and was succeeded by his eldest son Cao Rui (aged 22).<ref name=cres91-31/> Minister Chen Qun, General Cao Zhen, General Cao Xiu, and General Sima Yi{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Earlier, in 217, Sima Yi had become a member of the heir apparent Cao Pi's entourage.

But after 258, Shu politics became increasingly controlled by the [[eunuch]] faction, led by [[Huang Hao]], and corruption rose. Despite the energetic efforts of [[Jiang Wei]], Zhuge Liang's [[protege]], Shu was unable to secure any decisive achievement. In 263, Wei launched a three-pronged attack and the Shu army was forced into general retreat from Hanzhong. Jiang Wei hurriedly held a position at Jiange but he was outflanked by the Wei commander [[Deng Ai]], who force-marched his army from Yinping through territory formerly considered impassable. By the winter of the year, the capital [[Chengdu]] fell due to the strategic invasion of Wei by Deng Ai who invaded Chengdu personally. The emperor [[Liu Shan]] thus surrendered. The state of Shu had come to an end after 43 years. Liu Shan was reinstated to the Wei capital of Luoyang and was given the new title of the \"Duke of Anle\".  Directly translated, it meant the \"Duke of Safety and Happiness\" and was a trivial position with no actual power.\n\n====Fall of Wei====\nFrom the late 230s, tensions began to become visible between the imperial Cao clan and the Sima clan. Following the death of [[Cao Zhen]], factionalism was evident between [[Cao Shuang]] and the Grand Tutor [[Sima Yi]]. In deliberations, Cao Shuang placed his own supporters in important posts and excluded Sima Yi, whom he regarded as a dangerous threat. The power of the Sima clan, one of the great landowning families of the Han dynasty, was bolstered by Sima Yi's military victories. Additionally, Sima Yi was an extremely capable strategist and politician. In 238 he [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|crushed the rebellion]] of [[Gongsun Yuan]] and brought the [[Liaodong]] region directly under central control. Ultimately, he outmaneuvered Cao Shuang in power play. Taking advantage of an excursion by the imperial clansmen to the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|Gaoping Tombs]], Sima Yi undertook a [[putsch]] in Luoyang, forcing Cao Shuang's faction from authority. Many protested against the overwhelming power of the Sima family; notable among these were the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]]. One of the sages, [[Xi Kang]], was executed as part of the purges after Cao Shuang's downfall.\n\n[[Cao Huan]] succeeded to the throne in 260 after [[Cao Mao]] was killed in a failed coup against [[Sima Zhao]]. Soon after, Sima Zhao died and his title as Duke of J\u00ecn was inherited by his son [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]]. Sima Yan immediately began plotting to become emperor but faced stiff opposition. Following advice from his advisors, Cao Huan decided the best course of action would be to abdicate, unlike his predecessor Cao Mao. Sima Yan seized the throne in 266 after forcing Cao Huan's abdication, effectively overthrowing the Wei dynasty and establishing the successor [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]]. This situation was similar to the deposal of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] by [[Cao Pi]] 40 years earlier.\n\n====Fall of Wu====\n{{Main|Conquest of Wu by Jin}}\n\nFollowing [[Sun Quan]]'s death and the ascension of the young [[Sun Liang]] to the throne in 252, the state of Wu went into steady decline. Successful Wei suppression of rebellions in the southern [[Huai River]] region by [[Sima Zhao]] and [[Sima Shi]] reduced any opportunity of Wu influence. The fall of Shu signalled a change in Wei politics. After Liu Shan surrendered to Wei, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] (grandson of Sima Yi), overthrew the Wei emperor and proclaimed his own dynasty of Jin in 266, ending 46 years of Cao dominion in the north. After Jin's rise, emperor [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]] of Wu died, and his ministers gave the throne to [[Sun Hao]]. Sun Hao was a promising young man, but upon ascension he became a tyrant, killing or exiling all who dared oppose him in the court. In 269 [[Yang Hu]], a Jin commander in the south, started preparing for the invasion of Wu by ordering the construction of a fleet and the training of marines in [[Sichuan]] under [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]]. Four years later, [[Lu Kang (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Kang]], the last great general of Wu, died leaving no competent successor. The planned Jin offensive finally came at the end of 279. Sima Yan launched five simultaneous offensives along the [[Yangtze River]] from Jianye (present-day [[Nanjing]]) to Jiangling while the Sichuan fleet sailed downriver to [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. Under the strain of such an enormous attack, the Wu forces collapsed and Jianye fell in the third month of 280. Sun Hao surrendered and was given a fiefdom on which to live out his days. This marked the end of the Three Kingdoms era, and the beginning of a break in the forthcoming 300 years of disunity.\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Population ===\n[[File:Pottery courtyard, 3 kingdoms, Wu, Hubei, 1967.

After his coming to power, [[Dong Zhuo]] gave full swing to his army to loot and plunder the population, and abduct women into forced marriages, servants or consorts. When the Guandong Coalition was starting the campaign against Dong Zhuo, he embarked upon a scorched earth campaign, proclaiming that \"all the population of [[Luoyang]] be forced to move to [[Chang'an]], all the palaces, temples, official residences and homes be burnt, no one should stay within that area of 200 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''\".  Considering the hardships of that time this amounted to a death sentence for many, and cries of discontent rose as the population of Luoyang decreased sharply. When Cao Cao attacked [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]], it was said that \"hundreds of thousands of men and women were buried alive, even dogs and chickens did not survive. The [[Si River]] was blocked. From then on, these five towns never recovered.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  When [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]] and his army were advancing towards the [[Guanzhong]] area, \"there remained hundreds of thousands of people, but Li Jue allowed his army to plunder the cities and the people, thus making the people have nothing but eat each other to death.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe following table shows the severe decrease of population during that period. From the late Eastern Han to the Western Jin dynasty, despite the length of about 125 years, the peak population only equaled 35.3% of the peak population during the Eastern Han dynasty. From the Western Jin dynasty to the [[Sui dynasty]], the population never recovered. High militarization of the population was common. For example, the population of Shu was 900,000, but the military numbered over 100,000. The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' contains population figures for the Three Kingdoms. As with many Chinese historical population figures, these numbers are likely to be less than the actual populations, since census and tax records went hand in hand, and tax evaders were often not on records.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Three Kingdoms Period Populations<ref>From Zou Jiwan ({{zh|c=\u9112\u7d00\u842c|links=no}}), ''Zhongguo Tongshi \u2013 Weijin Nanbeichao Shi'' {{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u901a\u53f2\u00b7\u9b4f\u6649\u5357\u5317\u671d\u53f2}}, (1992).</ref>\n|-\n!

Other factors such as mass famines and diseases, due to the collapse of sustaining governance and migrations out of China must be taken into account.\n\n=== Economy ===\nIn the late Eastern Han dynasty, due to natural disasters and social unrest, the economy was badly depressed, leading to the massive waste of farmland. Some local landlords and aristocracy established their own strongholds to defend themselves and developed agriculture, which gradually evolved into a self-sufficient manorial system. The system of strongholds and manors also had effects on the economical mode of following dynasties. In addition, because of the collapse of the imperial court, those worn copper coins were not melted and reminted and many privately minted coins appeared. In the Three Kingdoms period, newly minted coins never made their way into currency. Due to the collapse of the coinage, Cao Wei officially declared silk cloth and grains as the main currencies in 221.<ref name = ANU>{{cite web|title=The Three Kingdoms and Western Jin: A history of China in the Third Century AD |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/3KWJin.html |last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe |publisher=Australian National University |date=November 2003 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn economic terms the division of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern [[Song dynasty]], 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and [[Sichuan]]). These geographical divisions are underscored by the fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linking north and south, the hauling-way through the [[Three Gorges]] of the [[Yangtze River]] linking southern China with Sichuan and the [[gallery road]]s joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of [[Zhuge Liang]] (see [[Longzhong Plan]]).\n\n==Literature==\n\n[[File:A Fragment of Biography of Bu Zhi History Books of Three Kingdoms 02 2012-12.JPG|thumb|A Fragment of Biography of ''Bu Zhi'' History Books of Three Kingdoms.]]\n\n[[Cao Cao]], the founder of the Wei kingdom and his four sons were [[Poetry of Cao Cao|influential poets]], especially  [[Cao Zhi]] (192-232) and [[Cao Pi]] (187-226).<ref>{{Cite book|author=Burton Watson|title=Chinese Lyricism:: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1971|isbn=0-231-03464-4|p=[https://archive.org/details/chineselyricism00burt/page/38 38]|author-link=Burton Watson|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/chineselyricism00burt/page/38}}</ref> Cao Pi wrote the earliest work of literary criticism, the ''Essay on Literature''.

The most complete and influential example is the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', written by [[Luo Guanzhong]] during the [[Ming dynasty]]. Possibly due to the popularity of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', the Three Kingdoms era is one of the most well-known non-modern Chinese eras in terms of iconic characters, deeds and exploits. This is reflected in the way that fictional accounts of the Three Kingdoms, mostly based on the novel, play a significant role in East Asian popular culture. Books, television dramas, films, cartoons, anime, games, and music on the topic are still regularly produced in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and Southeast Asia.<ref>Craig J.

The system is divided into a series of ranges, with the individual mountains averaging around {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The highest of the group is [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mount Mitchell]] in [[North Carolina]] at {{convert|6684|ft|m|0}}, which is the highest point in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nThe term ''Appalachian'' refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range. Most broadly, it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region. The term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, usually including areas in the states of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], as well as sometimes extending as far south as northern [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and western [[South Carolina]], and as far north as [[Pennsylvania]], southern [[Ohio]], and parts of southern upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nThe [[Ouachita Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] were originally part of the Appalachians as well but became disconnected through geologic history.\n\n===Origin of the name===\n[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|Detail of Diego Guti\u00e9rrez's 1562 map of the Western Hemisphere, showing the first known use of a variation of the place name \"Appalachia\" (\"Apalchen\") \u2013 from the map ''Americae sive qvartae orbis partis nova et exactissima descriptio'']]\n\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], including [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]] whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' {{IPA-all|a.pa\u02c8la.t\u0283\u025bn|}}. The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name.

Stewart}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto expedition]] in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves. The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutierrez]]'s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.<ref>Walls, David (1978), [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/on-the-naming-of-appalachia.shtml \"On the Naming of Appalachia\"] In ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the \"[[Allegheny Mountains]]\", \"Alleghenies\", and even \"Alleghania\". In the early 19th century, [[Washington Irving]] proposed renaming the United States either Appalachia or Alleghania.<ref>[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967). ''Names on the Land''.

It includes the [[Long Range Mountains]] and [[Annieopsquotch Mountains]] on the island of Newfoundland, [[Chic-Choc Mountains]] and [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame Range]] in Quebec and New Brunswick, scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the [[Longfellow Mountains]] in Maine, the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountains]] in Vermont, and [[The Berkshires]] in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The [[Metacomet Ridge|Metacomet Ridge Mountains]] in Connecticut and south-central Massachusetts, although contained within the Appalachian province, is a younger system and not geologically associated with the Appalachians. The [[Monteregian Hills]], which cross the Green Mountains in Quebec, are also unassociated with the Appalachians.\n* ''Central'': The central section goes from the Hudson Valley to the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] (Great Kanawha) running through Virginia and West Virginia. It comprises (excluding various minor groups) the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Valley Ridges]] between the [[Allegheny Front]] of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], the [[New York\u2013New Jersey Highlands]], the [[Taconic Mountains]] in New York, and a large portion of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]].\n* ''Southern'': The southern section runs from the New River onwards. It consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge, which is divided into the Western Blue Ridge (or Unaka) Front and the Eastern Blue Ridge Front, the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]].\n\n[[File:Greene-county-bald-mtns-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bald Mountains]]]]\nThe [[Adirondack Mountains]] in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but, geologically speaking, are a southern extension of the [[Laurentian Mountains]] of Canada.<ref name=geomorph/><ref name=peakbag/><ref name=weidensaul/>\n\n[[File:WV plateau.jpg|right|thumb|Shaded relief map of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] on the [[Virginia]]\u2013[[West Virginia]] border]]\n\nIn addition to the true folded mountains, known as the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|ridge and valley province]], the area of [[dissected plateau]] to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians. This includes the [[Catskill Mountains]] of southeastern New York, the [[The Poconos|Poconos]] in Pennsylvania, and the [[Allegheny Plateau]] of southwestern New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia. This same plateau is known as the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.\n\nThe dissected plateau area, while not actually made up of geological [[mountain]]s, is popularly called \"mountains,\" especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, and while the ridges are not high, the terrain is extremely rugged. In Ohio and New York, some of the plateau has been [[Glaciated Rocks|glaciated]], which has rounded off the sharp ridges and filled the valleys to some extent. The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains.\n\nThe Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical divide between the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]] of the United States and the [[Midwest]] region of the country. The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia.\n\nThe [[Appalachian Trail]] is a {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} hiking trail that runs all the way from [[Mount Katahdin]] in Maine to [[Springer Mountain]] in Georgia, passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system. The [[International Appalachian Trail]] is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]].\n\n===Chief summits===\nThe Appalachian belt includes, with the ranges enumerated above, the plateaus sloping southward to [[Atlantic Ocean|the Atlantic Ocean]] in [[New England]], and south-eastward to the border of the [[coastal plain]] through the central and southern Atlantic states; and on the north-west, the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys, including the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion, the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself.

In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis. The [[drainage divide]] of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] in Virginia. South of the New River, rivers head into the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges ([[water gap]]s), escape by way of the [[Cumberland River]] and the [[Tennessee River]] rivers to the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Mississippi River]], and thence to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the central section, north of the New River, the rivers, rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through great gorges to the Great Valley, and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River, [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], [[Potomac River]], and [[Susquehanna River]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nIn the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, and thus the main lines of drainage run from north to south, exemplified by the [[Hudson River]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> However, the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic [[glacier]]s of the [[Ice Age]]s\u2014the same glaciers that deposited their [[terminal moraine]]s in southern New York and formed the east\u2013west [[Long Island]].\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Appalachians}}\n\n[[File:Appalachian map.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] Appalachian zones in the United States]]\nA look at rocks that are exposed in today's Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust [[Fault (geology)|faulted]] marine [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[volcanic rock]]s and slivers of ancient ocean floor, which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision. The birth of the Appalachian ranges, some 480 million years ago, marks the first of several mountain-building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] with the Appalachians near the center. Because North America and Africa were connected, the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the [[Little Atlas]] in [[Morocco]]. This mountain range, known as the [[Central Pangean Mountains]], extended into [[Scotland]], before the Mesozoic Era opening of the Iapetus Ocean, from the North America/Europe collision (See [[Caledonian orogeny]]).\n\nDuring the middle [[Ordovician Period]] (about 496\u2013440&nbsp;million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain-building event ([[Taconic orogeny]]) in [[North America]]. The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]], collided with and began sinking beneath the [[North American craton]]. With the birth of this new [[subduction]] zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As the mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down over time. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see [[Alleghanian orogeny]]).<ref name=\"usgs\">{{Cite web |url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/appalach.html |title=Geologic Provinces of the United States: Appalachian Highlands Province |publisher=USGS |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZY7F4LI?url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/appalach.html |archive-date=June 22, 2013 |access-date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain.<ref name=\"usgs\" /> It was not until the region was uplifted during the [[Cenozoic Era]] that the distinctive topography of the present formed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Poag |first=C.

At {{convert|6684|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Mitchell]] in [[North Carolina]] is the highest peak east of the [[Mississippi River]]]]\nThe floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology, latitude, elevation and moisture availability. Geobotanically, they constitute a [[floristic province]] of the [[North American Atlantic Region]]. The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad-leaf trees and evergreen needle-leaf conifers, but also contain the evergreen broad-leaf [[American holly]] (''{{lang|la|Ilex opaca}}''), and the deciduous needle-leaf conifer, the [[Tamarack larch|tamarack]], or eastern larch (''{{lang|la|Larix laricina}}'').\n\nThe dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the [[red spruce]] (''{{lang|la|Picea rubens}}''), which grows from near sea level to above {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (asl) in northern [[New England]] and southeastern Canada. It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians, it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the [[black spruce]] (''{{lang|la|Picea mariana}}''), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal [[balsam fir]] (''{{lang|la|Abies balsamea}}''), and the southern high elevation endemic, [[Fraser fir]] (''{{lang|la|Abies fraseri}}'').  Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]].  Fraser fir rarely occurs below {{convert|5500|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, and becomes the dominant tree type at {{convert|6200|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.<ref>Rose Houk, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park: A Natural History Guide'' (Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1993), pp. 50\u201362.</ref>  By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above {{convert|3900|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However balsam fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6.<ref>Fowells, H.A., 1965, ''Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States'', Agricultural Handbook No. 271, [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Dept. of Agriculture]], Forest Service, Washington D.C.</ref>\n[[File:Rockytop and Patterson Ridges (13083210443).jpg|thumb|[[Shenandoah National Park]]]]\n\n[[Eastern hemlock|Eastern or Canada hemlock]] (''{{lang|la|Tsuga canadensis}}'') is another important evergreen needle-leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south but is confined to lower elevations than red spruce and the firs. It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and [[cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]]s. It is, unfortunately, subject to the [[hemlock woolly adelgid]] (''{{lang|la|Adelges tsugae}}''), an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is [[Carolina hemlock]] (''{{lang|la|Tsuga caroliniana}}''). Like Canada hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid.\n\nSeveral species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are [[eastern white pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus strobus }}''), [[Virginia pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus virginiana}}''), [[pitch pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus rigida }}''), [[Table Mountain pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus pungens}}'') and [[shortleaf pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus echinata}}''). [[Red pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus resinosa}}'') is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.\n[[File:Craggy Gardens-27527.jpg|thumb|left|The view from Craggy Gardens on the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]]]]\nThe Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in [[Emma Lucy Braun|E. Lucy Braun]]'s 1950 classic, ''Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America'' (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are [[Tilia heterophylla|white basswood]] (''{{lang|la|Tilia heterophylla}}''), [[yellow buckeye]] (''{{lang|la|Aesculus octandra}}''), [[sugar maple]] (''{{lang|la|Acer saccharum}}''), [[American beech]] (''{{lang|la|Fagus grandifolia}}''), [[tuliptree]] (''{{lang|la|Liriodendron tulipifera}}''), [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] (''{{lang|la|Fraxinus americana }}'') and [[yellow birch]] (''{{lang|la|Betula alleganiensis}}''). Other common trees are [[red maple]] (''{{lang|la|Acer rubrum}}''), [[Shagbark hickory|shagbark]] and [[Bitternut hickory|bitternut]] hickories (''{{lang|la|Carya ovata and C. cordiformis}}'') and [[Sweet birch|black or sweet birch]] (''{{lang|la|Betula lenta }}''). Small understory trees and shrubs include [[flowering dogwood]] (''{{lang|la|Cornus florida}}''), [[hophornbeam]] (''{{lang|la|Ostrya virginiana}}''), [[witch-hazel]] (''{{lang|la|Hamamelis virginiana}}'') and [[Lindera|spicebush]] (''{{lang|la|Lindera benzoin}}''). There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American [[ginseng]] (''{{lang|la|Panax quinquefolius}}''), [[goldenseal]] (''{{lang|la|Hydrastis canadensis}}''), [[bloodroot]] (''{{lang|la|Sanguinaria canadensis}}'') and [[black cohosh]] (''{{lang|la|Cimicifuga racemosa}}'').\n\nThe foregoing trees, shrubs, and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich [[mesic habitat|mesic]] forests that generally occupy coves, stream valleys and [[flood plain]]s throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations. In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse \"northern hardwoods\" with canopies dominated only by American beech, sugar maple, [[American basswood]] (''{{lang|la|Tilia americana}}'') and yellow birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs.\n\nDryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak-chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks (''{{lang|la|Quercus}}'' spp.), [[hickory|hickories]] (''{{lang|la|Carya}}'' spp.) and, in the past, by the [[American chestnut]] (''{{lang|la|Castanea dentata}}''). The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal [[chestnut blight]] (''{{lang|la|Cryphonectaria parasitica}}''), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present-day forest canopies, chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.\n\nThe oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of [[Quercus velutina|black]], [[Northern red oak|northern red]], [[White oak|white]], [[Chestnut oak|chestnut]] and [[scarlet oak]]s (''{{lang|la|Quercus velutina, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. prinus}} and {{lang|la|Q. coccinea}}'') and hickories, such as the pignut (''{{lang|la|Carya glabra}}'') in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.\n[[File:Rhododendron maximum-27527.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rhododendron maximum|Great laurel]] thicket in the [[Pisgah National Forest]]]]\nThe oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] (''{{lang|la|Kalmia latifolia}}''), various species of [[blueberry|blueberries]] (''{{lang|la|Vaccinium}}'' spp.), [[Gaylussacia baccata|black huckleberry]] (''{{lang|la|Gaylussacia baccata}}''), a number of deciduous [[rhododendron]]s (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as [[teaberry]] (''{{lang|la|Gaultheria procumbens}}'') and [[trailing arbutus]] (''{{lang|la|Epigaea repens }}''). The evergreen great rhododendron (''{{lang|la|Rhododendron maximum}}'') is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer [[chinquapin oak]] (''{{lang|la|Quercus muehlenbergii}}'') demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.\n\nThe Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of [[bryophyte]]s (mosses and liverworts), as well as [[fungi]]. Some species are rare and/or endemic. As with [[vascular plant]]s, these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found.\n\nEastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks. Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced [[gypsy moth]] (''{{lang|la|Lymantria dispar}}''), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the genetic stock, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because hardwoods sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the [[hemlock woolly adelgid]]. Perhaps more serious is the introduced [[beech bark disease]] complex, which includes both a scale insect (''{{lang|la|Cryptococcus fagisuga}}'') and fungal components.\n\n[[File:Cranberry-glades-fog-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|[[Cranberry Glades]], a bog preserve in West Virginia]]\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing, which resulted in the designation of the national forests and parks as well many state protected areas. However, these and a variety of other destructive activities continue, albeit in diminished forms; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold.\n\n[[Appalachian bogs]] are [[boreal ecosystem]]s, which occur in many places in the Appalachians, particularly the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] subranges.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/mtbog.pdf |title=Info |website=www.fws.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/mountain_bogs/ |title=Home \u2013 Mountain Bogs \u2013 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |website=www.fws.gov}}</ref> Though popularly called [[bog]]s, many of them are technically [[fen]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF0QNPA8IsM&index=32&list=PLnN7OGI1bJ88pzzjPYF-U6pgYTwj_8nHe |title=Southern Appalachian Cranberry Bog |last=expeditionspatrick |via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Fauna===\nAnimals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of [[tree squirrel]]s. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation [[eastern gray squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Sciurus carolinensis}}''). Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger [[fox squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Sciurus niger}}'') and the much smaller [[southern flying squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Glaucomys volans}}''). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the [[American red squirrel|red squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Tamiasciurus hudsonicus}}''), whereas the Appalachian [[northern flying squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus}}''), which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests.\n\n[[File:Southern Flying Squirrel-27527-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Southern flying squirrel]]]]\n\nAs familiar as squirrels are the [[eastern cottontail]] rabbit (''{{lang|la|Silvilagus floridanus}}'') and the [[white-tailed deer]] (''{{lang|la|Odocoileus virginianus}}''). The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the [[eastern wolf]] (''{{lang|la|Canis lupus lycaon}}'') and the [[North American cougar|cougar]]. This has led to the [[overgrazing]] and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of agricultural crops. Other deer include the [[eastern moose|moose]] (''{{lang|la|Alces alces }}''), found only in the north, and the [[elk]] (''{{lang|la|Cervus canadensis}}''), which, although once [[Eastern elk|extirpated]], is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. In [[Quebec]], the Chic-Chocs host the only population of [[caribou]] (''{{lang|la|Rangifer tarandus}}'') south of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying of [[snowshoe hare]] (''{{lang|la|Lepus americanus}}'').  However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small.\n\nAnother species of great interest is the [[North American beaver|beaver]] (''{{lang|la|Castor canadensis}}''), which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt. This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains.\n\nOther common forest animals are the [[American black bear|black bear]] (''{{lang|la|Ursus americanus}}''), [[striped skunk]] (''{{lang|la|Mephitis mephitis}}''), [[raccoon]] (''{{lang|la|Procyon lotor}}''), [[groundhog|woodchuck]] (''{{lang|la|Marmota monax}}''), [[bobcat]] (''{{lang|la|Lynx rufus}}''), [[gray fox]] (''{{lang|la|Urocyon cinereoargenteus}}''), [[red fox]] (''{{lang|la|Vulpes vulpes}}'') and in recent years, the [[coyote]] (''{{lang|la|Canis latrans}}''), another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of eastern and [[red wolf|red wolves]] (''{{lang|la|Canis rufus}}''). European [[boar]]s (''{{lang|la|Sus scrofa}}'') were introduced in the early 20th century.\n\nCharacteristic birds of the forest are [[wild turkey]] (''{{lang|la|Meleagris gallopavo silvestris}}''), [[ruffed grouse]] (''{{lang|la|Bonasa umbellus}}''), [[mourning dove]] (''{{lang|la|Zenaida macroura}}''), [[common raven]] (''{{lang|la|Corvus corax}}''), [[wood duck]] (''{{lang|la|Aix sponsa}}''), [[great horned owl]] (''{{lang|la|Bubo virginianus}}''), [[barred owl]] (''{{lang|la|Strix varia}}''), [[Scops owl|screech owl]] (''{{lang|la|Megascops asio}}''), [[red-tailed hawk]] (''{{lang|la|Buteo jamaicensis}}''), [[red-shouldered hawk]] (''{{lang|la|Buteo lineatus}}''), and [[northern goshawk]] (''{{lang|la|Accipiter gentilis}}''), as well as a great variety of \"songbirds\" ([[Passeriformes]]), like the warblers in particular.\n\n[[File:Wild Turkey-27527-1.jpg|thumb|right|Male [[Wild turkey|eastern wild turkey]]]]\n\nOf great importance are the many species of [[salamander]]s and, in particular, the [[lungless salamander|lungless]] species (Family ''{{lang|la|Plethodontidae}}'') that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris, on the forest floor. Most frequently seen, however, is the [[Eastern newt|eastern or red-spotted newt]] (''{{lang|la|Notophthalmus viridescens}}''), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor.  It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the [[wood frog]] (''{{lang|la|Rana sylvatica}}'') is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as [[spring peeper]]s (''{{lang|la|Pseudacris crucifer}}''), enliven the forest with their calls. Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats.\n\nAlthough reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians, a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-venomous [[black rat snake]] (''{{lang|la|Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta}}''), while the [[common garter snake]] (''{{lang|la|Thamnophis sirtalis}}'') is among the smallest but most abundant. The [[American copperhead]] (''{{lang|la|Agkistrodon contortrix}}'') and the [[timber rattler]] (''{{lang|la|Crotalus horridus}}'') are venomous [[pit viper]]s. There are few lizards, but the [[broad-headed skink]] (''{{lang|la|Eumeces laticeps}}''), at up to {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the [[eastern box turtle]] (''{{lang|la|Terrapene carolina carolina}}''), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large [[common snapping turtle]] (''{{lang|la|Chelydra serpentina}}''), which occurs throughout the Appalachians.\n\nAppalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life. Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family (family [[Cyprinidae]]), while species of the colorful [[Darter (fish)|darters]] (''{{lang|la|Percina}}'' spp.) are also abundant.<ref>Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr 1991, ''A Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes, North America, North of Mexico'', Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston</ref>\n\nA characteristic fish of shaded, cool Appalachian forest streams is the [[Brook trout|wild brook or speckled trout]] (''{{lang|la|Salvelinus fontinalis}}''), which is much sought after as a game fish.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Cl|Flora of the Appalachian Mountains|Flora of the Appalachian Mountains}}\n* [[Appalachia]]\n* [[Appalachian League]]\n* [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]\n* [[Appalachian Trail]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=appBasin>\n  {{cite web|publisher=USGS|url=http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/noga95/prov67/text/prov67.pdf\n  | title=Appalachian Basin Province (067)|first=R.T.|last=Ryder|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Palmer et al 2010\">\n  {{cite journal |last=Palmer|first=M.

The system is divided into a series of ranges, with the individual mountains averaging around {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The highest of the group is [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mount Mitchell]] in [[North Carolina]] at {{convert|6684|ft|m|0}}, which is the highest point in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nThe term ''Appalachian'' refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range. Most broadly, it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region. The term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, usually including areas in the states of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], as well as sometimes extending as far south as northern [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and western [[South Carolina]], and as far north as [[Pennsylvania]], southern [[Ohio]], and parts of southern upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nThe [[Ouachita Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] were originally part of the Appalachians as well but became disconnected through geologic history.\n\n===Origin of the name===\n[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|Detail of Diego Guti\u00e9rrez's 1562 map of the Western Hemisphere, showing the first known use of a variation of the place name \"Appalachia\" (\"Apalchen\") \u2013 from the map ''Americae sive qvartae orbis partis nova et exactissima descriptio'']]\n\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], including [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]] whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' {{IPA-all|a.pa\u02c8la.t\u0283\u025bn|}}. The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled \"Appalachian,\" it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.<ref>After [[Florida]], [[Cape Canaveral]], and [[Dry Tortugas]]: {{Cite book |last=Stewart |first=George |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |publisher=Random House |year=1945 |location=New York |pages=11\u201313, 17, 18 |author-link=George R. Stewart}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto expedition]] in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves. The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutierrez]]'s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.<ref>Walls, David (1978), [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/on-the-naming-of-appalachia.shtml \"On the Naming of Appalachia\"] In ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century.

It includes the [[Long Range Mountains]] and [[Annieopsquotch Mountains]] on the island of Newfoundland, [[Chic-Choc Mountains]] and [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame Range]] in Quebec and New Brunswick, scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the [[Longfellow Mountains]] in Maine, the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountains]] in Vermont, and [[The Berkshires]] in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The [[Metacomet Ridge|Metacomet Ridge Mountains]] in Connecticut and south-central Massachusetts, although contained within the Appalachian province, is a younger system and not geologically associated with the Appalachians. The [[Monteregian Hills]], which cross the Green Mountains in Quebec, are also unassociated with the Appalachians.\n* ''Central'': The central section goes from the Hudson Valley to the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] (Great Kanawha) running through Virginia and West Virginia. It comprises (excluding various minor groups) the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Valley Ridges]] between the [[Allegheny Front]] of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], the [[New York\u2013New Jersey Highlands]], the [[Taconic Mountains]] in New York, and a large portion of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]].\n* ''Southern'': The southern section runs from the New River onwards. It consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge, which is divided into the Western Blue Ridge (or Unaka) Front and the Eastern Blue Ridge Front, the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]].\n\n[[File:Greene-county-bald-mtns-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bald Mountains]]]]\nThe [[Adirondack Mountains]] in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but, geologically speaking, are a southern extension of the [[Laurentian Mountains]] of Canada.<ref name=geomorph/><ref name=peakbag/><ref name=weidensaul/>\n\n[[File:WV plateau.jpg|right|thumb|Shaded relief map of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] on the [[Virginia]]\u2013[[West Virginia]] border]]\n\nIn addition to the true folded mountains, known as the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|ridge and valley province]], the area of [[dissected plateau]] to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians. This includes the [[Catskill Mountains]] of southeastern New York, the [[The Poconos|Poconos]] in Pennsylvania, and the [[Allegheny Plateau]] of southwestern New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia. This same plateau is known as the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.\n\nThe dissected plateau area, while not actually made up of geological [[mountain]]s, is popularly called \"mountains,\" especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, and while the ridges are not high, the terrain is extremely rugged. In Ohio and New York, some of the plateau has been [[Glaciated Rocks|glaciated]], which has rounded off the sharp ridges and filled the valleys to some extent. The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains.\n\nThe Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical divide between the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]] of the United States and the [[Midwest]] region of the country. The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia.\n\nThe [[Appalachian Trail]] is a {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} hiking trail that runs all the way from [[Mount Katahdin]] in Maine to [[Springer Mountain]] in Georgia, passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system. The [[International Appalachian Trail]] is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]].\n\n===Chief summits===\nThe Appalachian belt includes, with the ranges enumerated above, the plateaus sloping southward to [[Atlantic Ocean|the Atlantic Ocean]] in [[New England]], and south-eastward to the border of the [[coastal plain]] through the central and southern Atlantic states; and on the north-west, the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys, including the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion, the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself.

In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis. The [[drainage divide]] of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] in Virginia. South of the New River, rivers head into the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges ([[water gap]]s), escape by way of the [[Cumberland River]] and the [[Tennessee River]] rivers to the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Mississippi River]], and thence to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the central section, north of the New River, the rivers, rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through great gorges to the Great Valley, and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River, [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], [[Potomac River]], and [[Susquehanna River]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nIn the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, and thus the main lines of drainage run from north to south, exemplified by the [[Hudson River]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> However, the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic [[glacier]]s of the [[Ice Age]]s\u2014the same glaciers that deposited their [[terminal moraine]]s in southern New York and formed the east\u2013west [[Long Island]].\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Appalachians}}\n\n[[File:Appalachian map.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] Appalachian zones in the United States]]\nA look at rocks that are exposed in today's Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust [[Fault (geology)|faulted]] marine [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[volcanic rock]]s and slivers of ancient ocean floor, which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision. The birth of the Appalachian ranges, some 480 million years ago, marks the first of several mountain-building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] with the Appalachians near the center. Because North America and Africa were connected, the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the [[Little Atlas]] in [[Morocco]]. This mountain range, known as the [[Central Pangean Mountains]], extended into [[Scotland]], before the Mesozoic Era opening of the Iapetus Ocean, from the North America/Europe collision (See [[Caledonian orogeny]]).\n\nDuring the middle [[Ordovician Period]] (about 496\u2013440&nbsp;million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain-building event ([[Taconic orogeny]]) in [[North America]]. The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]], collided with and began sinking beneath the [[North American craton]]. With the birth of this new [[subduction]] zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As the mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down over time. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see [[Alleghanian orogeny]]).<ref name=\"usgs\">{{Cite web |url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/appalach.html |title=Geologic Provinces of the United States: Appalachian Highlands Province |publisher=USGS |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZY7F4LI?url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/appalach.html |archive-date=June 22, 2013 |access-date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain.<ref name=\"usgs\" /> It was not until the region was uplifted during the [[Cenozoic Era]] that the distinctive topography of the present formed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Poag |first=C.

At {{convert|6684|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Mitchell]] in [[North Carolina]] is the highest peak east of the [[Mississippi River]]]]\nThe floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology, latitude, elevation and moisture availability. Geobotanically, they constitute a [[floristic province]] of the [[North American Atlantic Region]]. The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad-leaf trees and evergreen needle-leaf conifers, but also contain the evergreen broad-leaf [[American holly]] (''{{lang|la|Ilex opaca}}''), and the deciduous needle-leaf conifer, the [[Tamarack larch|tamarack]], or eastern larch (''{{lang|la|Larix laricina}}'').\n\nThe dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the [[red spruce]] (''{{lang|la|Picea rubens}}''), which grows from near sea level to above {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (asl) in northern [[New England]] and southeastern Canada. It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians, it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the [[black spruce]] (''{{lang|la|Picea mariana}}''), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal [[balsam fir]] (''{{lang|la|Abies balsamea}}''), and the southern high elevation endemic, [[Fraser fir]] (''{{lang|la|Abies fraseri}}'').  Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]].  Fraser fir rarely occurs below {{convert|5500|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, and becomes the dominant tree type at {{convert|6200|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.<ref>Rose Houk, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park: A Natural History Guide'' (Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1993), pp. 50\u201362.</ref>  By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above {{convert|3900|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However balsam fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6.<ref>Fowells, H.A., 1965, ''Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States'', Agricultural Handbook No. 271, [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Dept. of Agriculture]], Forest Service, Washington D.C.</ref>\n[[File:Rockytop and Patterson Ridges (13083210443).jpg|thumb|[[Shenandoah National Park]]]]\n\n[[Eastern hemlock|Eastern or Canada hemlock]] (''{{lang|la|Tsuga canadensis}}'') is another important evergreen needle-leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south but is confined to lower elevations than red spruce and the firs. It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and [[cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]]s. It is, unfortunately, subject to the [[hemlock woolly adelgid]] (''{{lang|la|Adelges tsugae}}''), an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is [[Carolina hemlock]] (''{{lang|la|Tsuga caroliniana}}''). Like Canada hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid.\n\nSeveral species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are [[eastern white pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus strobus }}''), [[Virginia pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus virginiana}}''), [[pitch pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus rigida }}''), [[Table Mountain pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus pungens}}'') and [[shortleaf pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus echinata}}''). [[Red pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus resinosa}}'') is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.\n[[File:Craggy Gardens-27527.jpg|thumb|left|The view from Craggy Gardens on the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]]]]\nThe Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in [[Emma Lucy Braun|E. Lucy Braun]]'s 1950 classic, ''Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America'' (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are [[Tilia heterophylla|white basswood]] (''{{lang|la|Tilia heterophylla}}''), [[yellow buckeye]] (''{{lang|la|Aesculus octandra}}''), [[sugar maple]] (''{{lang|la|Acer saccharum}}''), [[American beech]] (''{{lang|la|Fagus grandifolia}}''), [[tuliptree]] (''{{lang|la|Liriodendron tulipifera}}''), [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] (''{{lang|la|Fraxinus americana }}'') and [[yellow birch]] (''{{lang|la|Betula alleganiensis}}''). Other common trees are [[red maple]] (''{{lang|la|Acer rubrum}}''), [[Shagbark hickory|shagbark]] and [[Bitternut hickory|bitternut]] hickories (''{{lang|la|Carya ovata and C. cordiformis}}'') and [[Sweet birch|black or sweet birch]] (''{{lang|la|Betula lenta }}''). Small understory trees and shrubs include [[flowering dogwood]] (''{{lang|la|Cornus florida}}''), [[hophornbeam]] (''{{lang|la|Ostrya virginiana}}''), [[witch-hazel]] (''{{lang|la|Hamamelis virginiana}}'') and [[Lindera|spicebush]] (''{{lang|la|Lindera benzoin}}''). There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American [[ginseng]] (''{{lang|la|Panax quinquefolius}}''), [[goldenseal]] (''{{lang|la|Hydrastis canadensis}}''), [[bloodroot]] (''{{lang|la|Sanguinaria canadensis}}'') and [[black cohosh]] (''{{lang|la|Cimicifuga racemosa}}'').\n\nThe foregoing trees, shrubs, and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich [[mesic habitat|mesic]] forests that generally occupy coves, stream valleys and [[flood plain]]s throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations. In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse \"northern hardwoods\" with canopies dominated only by American beech, sugar maple, [[American basswood]] (''{{lang|la|Tilia americana}}'') and yellow birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs.\n\nDryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak-chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks (''{{lang|la|Quercus}}'' spp.), [[hickory|hickories]] (''{{lang|la|Carya}}'' spp.) and, in the past, by the [[American chestnut]] (''{{lang|la|Castanea dentata}}''). The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal [[chestnut blight]] (''{{lang|la|Cryphonectaria parasitica}}''), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present-day forest canopies, chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.\n\nThe oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of [[Quercus velutina|black]], [[Northern red oak|northern red]], [[White oak|white]], [[Chestnut oak|chestnut]] and [[scarlet oak]]s (''{{lang|la|Quercus velutina, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. prinus}} and {{lang|la|Q. coccinea}}'') and hickories, such as the pignut (''{{lang|la|Carya glabra}}'') in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.\n[[File:Rhododendron maximum-27527.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rhododendron maximum|Great laurel]] thicket in the [[Pisgah National Forest]]]]\nThe oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] (''{{lang|la|Kalmia latifolia}}''), various species of [[blueberry|blueberries]] (''{{lang|la|Vaccinium}}'' spp.), [[Gaylussacia baccata|black huckleberry]] (''{{lang|la|Gaylussacia baccata}}''), a number of deciduous [[rhododendron]]s (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as [[teaberry]] (''{{lang|la|Gaultheria procumbens}}'') and [[trailing arbutus]] (''{{lang|la|Epigaea repens }}''). The evergreen great rhododendron (''{{lang|la|Rhododendron maximum}}'') is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer [[chinquapin oak]] (''{{lang|la|Quercus muehlenbergii}}'') demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.\n\nThe Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of [[bryophyte]]s (mosses and liverworts), as well as [[fungi]]. Some species are rare and/or endemic. As with [[vascular plant]]s, these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found.\n\nEastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks. Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced [[gypsy moth]] (''{{lang|la|Lymantria dispar}}''), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the genetic stock, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because hardwoods sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the [[hemlock woolly adelgid]]. Perhaps more serious is the introduced [[beech bark disease]] complex, which includes both a scale insect (''{{lang|la|Cryptococcus fagisuga}}'') and fungal components.\n\n[[File:Cranberry-glades-fog-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|[[Cranberry Glades]], a bog preserve in West Virginia]]\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing, which resulted in the designation of the national forests and parks as well many state protected areas. However, these and a variety of other destructive activities continue, albeit in diminished forms; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold.\n\n[[Appalachian bogs]] are [[boreal ecosystem]]s, which occur in many places in the Appalachians, particularly the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] subranges.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/mtbog.pdf |title=Info |website=www.fws.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/mountain_bogs/ |title=Home \u2013 Mountain Bogs \u2013 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |website=www.fws.gov}}</ref> Though popularly called [[bog]]s, many of them are technically [[fen]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF0QNPA8IsM&index=32&list=PLnN7OGI1bJ88pzzjPYF-U6pgYTwj_8nHe |title=Southern Appalachian Cranberry Bog |last=expeditionspatrick |via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Fauna===\nAnimals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of [[tree squirrel]]s. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation [[eastern gray squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Sciurus carolinensis}}''). Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger [[fox squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Sciurus niger}}'') and the much smaller [[southern flying squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Glaucomys volans}}''). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the [[American red squirrel|red squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Tamiasciurus hudsonicus}}''), whereas the Appalachian [[northern flying squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus}}''), which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests.\n\n[[File:Southern Flying Squirrel-27527-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Southern flying squirrel]]]]\n\nAs familiar as squirrels are the [[eastern cottontail]] rabbit (''{{lang|la|Silvilagus floridanus}}'') and the [[white-tailed deer]] (''{{lang|la|Odocoileus virginianus}}''). The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the [[eastern wolf]] (''{{lang|la|Canis lupus lycaon}}'') and the [[North American cougar|cougar]]. This has led to the [[overgrazing]] and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of agricultural crops. Other deer include the [[eastern moose|moose]] (''{{lang|la|Alces alces }}''), found only in the north, and the [[elk]] (''{{lang|la|Cervus canadensis}}''), which, although once [[Eastern elk|extirpated]], is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. In [[Quebec]], the Chic-Chocs host the only population of [[caribou]] (''{{lang|la|Rangifer tarandus}}'') south of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying of [[snowshoe hare]] (''{{lang|la|Lepus americanus}}'').  However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small.\n\nAnother species of great interest is the [[North American beaver|beaver]] (''{{lang|la|Castor canadensis}}''), which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt. This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains.\n\nOther common forest animals are the [[American black bear|black bear]] (''{{lang|la|Ursus americanus}}''), [[striped skunk]] (''{{lang|la|Mephitis mephitis}}''), [[raccoon]] (''{{lang|la|Procyon lotor}}''), [[groundhog|woodchuck]] (''{{lang|la|Marmota monax}}''), [[bobcat]] (''{{lang|la|Lynx rufus}}''), [[gray fox]] (''{{lang|la|Urocyon cinereoargenteus}}''), [[red fox]] (''{{lang|la|Vulpes vulpes}}'') and in recent years, the [[coyote]] (''{{lang|la|Canis latrans}}''), another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of eastern and [[red wolf|red wolves]] (''{{lang|la|Canis rufus}}''). European [[boar]]s (''{{lang|la|Sus scrofa}}'') were introduced in the early 20th century.\n\nCharacteristic birds of the forest are [[wild turkey]] (''{{lang|la|Meleagris gallopavo silvestris}}''), [[ruffed grouse]] (''{{lang|la|Bonasa umbellus}}''), [[mourning dove]] (''{{lang|la|Zenaida macroura}}''), [[common raven]] (''{{lang|la|Corvus corax}}''), [[wood duck]] (''{{lang|la|Aix sponsa}}''), [[great horned owl]] (''{{lang|la|Bubo virginianus}}''), [[barred owl]] (''{{lang|la|Strix varia}}''), [[Scops owl|screech owl]] (''{{lang|la|Megascops asio}}''), [[red-tailed hawk]] (''{{lang|la|Buteo jamaicensis}}''), [[red-shouldered hawk]] (''{{lang|la|Buteo lineatus}}''), and [[northern goshawk]] (''{{lang|la|Accipiter gentilis}}''), as well as a great variety of \"songbirds\" ([[Passeriformes]]), like the warblers in particular.\n\n[[File:Wild Turkey-27527-1.jpg|thumb|right|Male [[Wild turkey|eastern wild turkey]]]]\n\nOf great importance are the many species of [[salamander]]s and, in particular, the [[lungless salamander|lungless]] species (Family ''{{lang|la|Plethodontidae}}'') that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris, on the forest floor. Most frequently seen, however, is the [[Eastern newt|eastern or red-spotted newt]] (''{{lang|la|Notophthalmus viridescens}}''), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor.  It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the [[wood frog]] (''{{lang|la|Rana sylvatica}}'') is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as [[spring peeper]]s (''{{lang|la|Pseudacris crucifer}}''), enliven the forest with their calls. Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats.\n\nAlthough reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians, a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-venomous [[black rat snake]] (''{{lang|la|Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta}}''), while the [[common garter snake]] (''{{lang|la|Thamnophis sirtalis}}'') is among the smallest but most abundant. The [[American copperhead]] (''{{lang|la|Agkistrodon contortrix}}'') and the [[timber rattler]] (''{{lang|la|Crotalus horridus}}'') are venomous [[pit viper]]s. There are few lizards, but the [[broad-headed skink]] (''{{lang|la|Eumeces laticeps}}''), at up to {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the [[eastern box turtle]] (''{{lang|la|Terrapene carolina carolina}}''), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large [[common snapping turtle]] (''{{lang|la|Chelydra serpentina}}''), which occurs throughout the Appalachians.\n\nAppalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life. Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family (family [[Cyprinidae]]), while species of the colorful [[Darter (fish)|darters]] (''{{lang|la|Percina}}'' spp.) are also abundant.<ref>Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr 1991, ''A Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes, North America, North of Mexico'', Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston</ref>\n\nA characteristic fish of shaded, cool Appalachian forest streams is the [[Brook trout|wild brook or speckled trout]] (''{{lang|la|Salvelinus fontinalis}}''), which is much sought after as a game fish.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Cl|Flora of the Appalachian Mountains|Flora of the Appalachian Mountains}}\n* [[Appalachia]]\n* [[Appalachian League]]\n* [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]\n* [[Appalachian Trail]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=appBasin>\n  {{cite web|publisher=USGS|url=http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/noga95/prov67/text/prov67.pdf\n  | title=Appalachian Basin Province (067)|first=R.T.|last=Ryder|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Palmer et al 2010\">\n  {{cite journal |last=Palmer|first=M.
