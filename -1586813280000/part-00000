This theory also suggested that seal brown horses were black horses with a trait called ''pangare''. Pangar\u00e9 is an ancestral trait also called \"mealy\", which outlines the soft or communicative parts of the horse in buff tan.\n\nThe combination of black and pangar\u00e9 was dismissed as the cause of brown in 2001, when a French research team published ''Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus)''. This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive ''a'' allele on the Agouti locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the ''a'' allele.<ref name=\"Rieder_2001\"/>\n\nSince 2001, the mechanisms of the variations within the \"bay\" category remain unclear.

This theory also suggested that seal brown horses were black horses with a trait called ''pangare''. Pangar\u00e9 is an ancestral trait also called \"mealy\", which outlines the soft or communicative parts of the horse in buff tan.\n\nThe combination of black and pangar\u00e9 was dismissed as the cause of brown in 2001, when a French research team published ''Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus)''. This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive ''a'' allele on the Agouti locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the ''a'' allele.<ref name=\"Rieder_2001\"/>\n\nSince 2001, the mechanisms of the variations within the \"bay\" category remain unclear.

When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the models within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.\n\n==Theories of rational thinking==\n===Max Weber===\nThe German scholar [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality.<ref name=kalberg/>\n\nThe first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion\u2014to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered \"meaningfully oriented.\" The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.\n\nThe advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given\u2014for religious or affect reasons, for example\u2014that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.\n\nWeber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)<ref>[[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref> and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.<ref>Eagleton, M.

One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Laird |first1=Philip N. |last2=Byrne |first2=Ruth M.

This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Thomas |title=The 'Rationality Wars' in Psychology: Where They Are and Where They Could Go |journal=Inquiry |date=February 2012 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201381 |doi=10.1080/0020174X.2012.643628 }}</ref>\n\n===Richard Brandt===\n[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a \"reforming definition\" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|url=https://archive.org/details/ethicaltheorypro0000bran|url-access=registration|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B.

Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and \"mechanical\". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.\n\nModern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Theoretical and practical==\n[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jes\u00fas Moster\u00edn]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.<ref>Moster\u00edn, Jes\u00fas (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acci\u00f3n humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.</ref> Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.\n\nThe distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.\n\nTheoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Moster\u00edn distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moster\u00edn |first1=Jes\u00fas |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313\u2013335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}</ref> Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.\n\n==Examples in different fields==\n\n===Logic===\n{{main|Logic and rationality}}\nAs the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.\n\n===Economics===\nRationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality\u2014basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational\u2014that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information\u2014in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.\n\nDebates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.\n\nOthers think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nWithin [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].<ref>Johnson-Laird, P.N. & Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''.

When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the models within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.\n\n==Theories of rational thinking==\n===Max Weber===\nThe German scholar [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality.<ref name=kalberg/>\n\nThe first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion\u2014to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered \"meaningfully oriented.\" The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.\n\nThe advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given\u2014for religious or affect reasons, for example\u2014that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.\n\nWeber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)<ref>[[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref> and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.<ref>Eagleton, M.

Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).\n\n===Psychology===\nIn the [[psychology of reasoning]], psychologists and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Laird |first1=Philip N. |last2=Byrne |first2=Ruth M. J. |title=Corrigendum: 'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=1 September 2009 |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=282\u2013287 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.003 }}</ref> However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the [[conjunction fallacy]], on the [[Wason selection task]], or the [[base rate fallacy]] suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Thomas |title=The 'Rationality Wars' in Psychology: Where They Are and Where They Could Go |journal=Inquiry |date=February 2012 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201381 |doi=10.1080/0020174X.2012.643628 }}</ref>\n\n===Richard Brandt===\n[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a \"reforming definition\" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|url=https://archive.org/details/ethicaltheorypro0000bran|url-access=registration|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B.

Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and \"mechanical\". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.\n\nModern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Theoretical and practical==\n[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jes\u00fas Moster\u00edn]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.<ref>Moster\u00edn, Jes\u00fas (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acci\u00f3n humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.</ref> Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.\n\nThe distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.\n\nTheoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Moster\u00edn distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moster\u00edn |first1=Jes\u00fas |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313\u2013335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}</ref> Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.\n\n==Examples in different fields==\n\n===Logic===\n{{main|Logic and rationality}}\nAs the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.\n\n===Economics===\nRationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality\u2014basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational\u2014that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information\u2014in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.\n\nDebates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.\n\nOthers think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nWithin [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].<ref>Johnson-Laird, P.N. & Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''.

Suddenly the craft's engines ignite, and Commander Moran is killed in the act of pushing another out of the way. Later, the crew finds two ghostly figures, Moran and an unidentified alien, roaming during the night cycle, soundlessly chanting before turning to attack the crew. The crew take shelter in the base's [[Faraday cage]] which the ghosts cannot enter.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] arrive later via the [[TARDIS]] and are briefed by acting commander Cass, who is deaf and assisted by her interpreter Lunn. Suddenly the base's systems switch to the night cycle, and before they can restore the day cycle, the ghosts have killed another crew member, and soon the ghost of that crew joins the other two. The Doctor recognises the alien ghost as Tivolian, a cowardly, peaceful race. Cass calls for an evacuation shuttle only to learn one has already been dispatched. The Doctor orders it to turn around, believing the ghosts have a nefarious purpose.\n\nThe Doctor is able to lure the ghosts into the Faraday cage, and with Cass's help, can read what they are chanting: \"the dark, the sword, the forsaken, the temple\". The Doctor determines these are galactic coordinates pointing to this location, and believes that the ghosts are killing the crew and trying to draw more victims to boost the strength of the broadcast of this signal; however, only those that have seen the glyphs in the ship are susceptible to the ghosts' influence. Using the base's remote drones, they find and collect a stasis chamber among the ruins, which the Doctor suspects is what the coordinates point to, but they cannot open it. The Doctor determines he must go back in time before the town was flooded to find the origin of the signal. The ghosts manipulate hatchways that separate Clara, Cass, and Lunn from the Doctor and crew members O'Donnell and Bennett. The Doctor promises Clara he will be back, and takes O'Donnell and Bennett with him to the TARDIS. Shortly after the TARDIS' departure, Clara, Cass, and Lunn witness a new ghost outside of the base \u2013 that of the Doctor.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe Doctor says that the ghost in the top hat is from the planet Tivoli, first mentioned in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] story \"The God Complex\", which featured a member of its native species named Gibbis.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4YFWPhGQjwsBjLbzjQwzgtw/under-the-lake-the-fact-file|title=BBC One \u2013 Doctor Who, Series 9, Under the Lake \u2013 Under the Lake: The Fact File|work=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWhen pondering what the ghosts actually are, the Doctor eliminates the possibility that they are Flesh avatars (\"[[The Rebel Flesh]]\" / \"[[The Almost People]]\"), [[Auton]]s (''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' et al.), or digital copies in the Nethersphere (\"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\" / \"[[Death in Heaven]]\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-hints-teasers-set-1-76528.htm|title=Under the Lake: Hints & Teasers (Set #1)|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-review-76631.htm|title=Under the Lake Review|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOne of the Doctor's \"cards\" has him offering reassurance that no-one, among other disasters, is going to be \"exterminated/upgraded\".

He closed his review by claiming \"Forty minutes flew by and the credits rolled too soon, leaving on a creepy cliffhanger that left me baying for more. If next week\u2019s conclusion of the story \u2013 and the 12-part series as a whole \u2013 can keep up the standard set by the opening three episodes, we\u2019re in for a treat.

Calling the episode \"impeccably structured\", he further stated that it \"has a tightness of narrative focus that often eludes the first episodes of Doctor Who two-parters\". He closed his review by saying the episode \"works beautifully as a propulsive monsters story\" and stating \"A simple, focused first episode figures to set up a twisted, sprawling second half.

He further went on to say \"It's this sense of claustrophobia that is among the episode's biggest selling points \u2013 watching a crew's camaraderie crumble as the pressure gets to them never grows old. Gloomy visuals and a haunting score from Murray Gold also do much to generate atmosphere and tension\" and closed his review stating \"Chills, action, adventure \u2013 this is old-school Doctor Who given a modern sheen and, most of all, it's enormous fun\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\"/> Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect five stars. He said \"This rollicking, hair-raising romp demonstrated that the sci-fi franchise still has the power to thrill and chill in equal measure\". He closed his review by claiming \"Forty minutes flew by and the credits rolled too soon, leaving on a creepy cliffhanger that left me baying for more. If next week\u2019s conclusion of the story \u2013 and the 12-part series as a whole \u2013 can keep up the standard set by the opening three episodes, we\u2019re in for a treat. Doctor Who will have regenerated once more\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\nAlasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also enjoyed the episode, awarding it a B+ grade. Calling the episode \"impeccably structured\", he further stated that it \"has a tightness of narrative focus that often eludes the first episodes of Doctor Who two-parters\". He closed his review by saying the episode \"works beautifully as a propulsive monsters story\" and stating \"A simple, focused first episode figures to set up a twisted, sprawling second half. But even without seeing the payoff, it\u2019s hard to imagine more efficient narrative construction for whatever that conclusion might be\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alisdair|title=Doctor Who tells a real ghost story, then gets crazy|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-tells-real-ghost-story-then-gets-crazy-226272 |work=The A.V.

He further stated \"As secrets were uncovered and deductions made, the plot rattled along with a pace that ended up as satisfying as it was intriguing\", and closed his review by saying \"in terms of wonderfully solid and spooky TV there\u2019s nothing to moan about here\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Jon |title=Doctor Who, Under the Lake, TV review: Extraterrestrial ghost story is scarier than the Daleks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/doctor-who-under-the-lake-tv-review-extraterrestrial-ghost-story-is-more-terrifying-than-the-daleks-a6677251.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Scott Collura of [[IGN]] was also highly impressed with the episode, awarding it a score of 8.5/10, deemed by the site as \"great\".
