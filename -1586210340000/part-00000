Their properties in Austria were confiscated by Nazi authorities.<ref>[http://www.sophie-hohenberg-czech-rep.eu/en/ Sophie Hohenberg Site]</ref> They both survived their imprisonment in Dachau.\n\nSophie's husband died in 1973,<ref>The Assassination of the Archduke, p. 273</ref> after which she led a quiet life in Austria, accompanied at times by her grandchildren. In 1981, she visited Konopi\u0161t\u011b for the first time in sixty years. During this visit, she talked of how happy her family life had been there.<ref>The Assassination of the Archduke, p. 273</ref>\n\nSophie lived to be 89 years old, dying in October 1990 at [[Thannhausen, Austria]]. She was laid to rest beside the body of her husband in the family crypt of her son-in-law, Baron Ernst Gudenus, at nearby Weizberg.<ref>The Assassination of the Archduke, p. 273</ref> She had outlived both of her younger siblings by many years.\n\n==Letter to Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107==\nDuring the trial of the men accused of murdering Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the only defendant to express remorse was [[Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107]], who expressed his regrets for what he had done and apologized to the children of the victims. Princess Sophie and her brothers were told about Cabrinovic's apology and wrote a letter to him. In the letter, they said they had heard about his apology and stated that his conscience could be at peace because they forgave him for his role in the murder of their parents. Sophie and Max signed the letter, but Ernst refused. The letter was delivered personally to Cabrinovic in his cell at [[Theresienstadt]], in [[Bohemia]], by the Jesuit Father Anton Puntigam, who had given the last rites to Franz Ferdinand and his wife. On 23 January 1916, Princess Sophie and her brothers were informed that Cabrinovic had died.<ref>The Assassination of the Archduke, p. 246</ref>\n\n==Fictional appearances==\nA fictional version of Princess Sophie, played by Danish actress Amalie Ihle Alstrup, appeared in \"Vienna, November 1908\", an episode of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' later re-edited to form half of ''The Perils of Cupid''. [[Indiana Jones|Young Indy]] falls in love with the princess and shares his first kiss with her, but is forbidden from seeing her further. Several times during the series, he is shown wearing a locket that contains her picture, which she gave to him.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

In the 7th century Jews sought refuge in [[Diocletian's Palace]] after the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatian]] capital [[Salona]] was overrun by the [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]]. A synagogue was built into the western wall of the palace in the 16th century, and descendants of the Salona refugees are still living in the area.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\nOne of the oldest written sources, which could indicate the presence of Jews on Croatian territory, comes from the letter of the vizier [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], which was sent to [[Joseph (Khazar)|King Joseph]] of the [[Khazars]]. This letter from the 10th century refers to the \"King of the Gebalim - Slavs\", see the article [[Miholjanec]], whose country borders the country of the [[Hungarians]]. The King sent a delegation, which included \"Mar ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:\"Lord\") Shaul and Mar Joseph\", to the Caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] of C\u00f3rdoba. Delegates reported that ''mar'' Hisdai Amram came to the Khazar king's palace from the country where the \"Gebalim\" lived. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] \"gebal\" means \"mountain\". Hungarian sources reported, that a [[vineyard]] near Miholjanec was named \"master of the mountain\". Croatia is also represented as a country of \"Gebalim\" in a letter of Bishop Gauderich addressed to Anastasius as a co-author of the legend of Cherson in the 9th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=04gZkMRM2L8C&pg=PA23&dq=gebalim&hl=de&ei=ifKKTp0PkMq0BtbnyKsC&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gebalim&f=false Jewish Travellers, Volume 12 of Broadway travellers, Elkan Nathan Adler, Routledge, 2004.] {{ISBN|978-0-415-34466-1}}</ref><ref>[http://www.semovci.hr/fratrovec Ivanko Vla\u0161i\u0107ek iz 1923.]</ref>\n<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dOIRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA398&dq=%22king+of+the+mountains%22&hl=de&ei=kKKFTuHLIMT0sgbXmMHhAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22king%20of%20the%20mountains%22&f=false The Spirit of the English magazines, str. 398, Monroe and Francis, 1826.]</ref><ref>http://www.efos-statistika.com/hobi/Andrijana_az.pdf{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nThe Jewish communities of Croatia flourished in the 13th and 14th centuries, with the communities enjoying prosperity and peaceful relations with their [[Croatian people|Croatian]] neighbors.<ref name=\"Jewish Virtual Library Croatia\">[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Croatia.html Jewish Virtual Library (Croatia)]</ref>\n\nThis ended in 1456, when Jews, along with most non-Catholic Croats, were forced out.

Some of these refugees found their way to Croatia, in particular to [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Dubrovnik]], on the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]].<ref name=\"bh.org.il\"/>\n\n===Habsburg rule===\nIn the 17th century, Jews were still not permitted to settle in northern Croatia. Jews traveled to Croatia as traveling merchants, mostly from neighboring [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]]. They were generally permitted to stay only a few days.<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/> In the early part of the century, the [[Croatian Parliament]] (\"Sabor\") confirmed its ban on permanent settlement when a Jewish family attempted to settle in [[\u0110ur\u0111evac]].<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/>\n\nIn 1753, although still officially banned, Jews were allowed to settle in [[Bjelovar]], [[Koprivnica]] and [[Vara\u017edin]], by General Beck, the military commander of the [[Vara\u017edin county|Vara\u017edin region]]. In order to streamline the treatment of Jews in Croatia, Count Franjo Pata\u010di\u0107, by order of the Royal Office in Vara\u017edin, wrote a comprehensive report advocating Jewish permanent residence in Croatia on the basis that \"''most of them are merchants, and trade makes towns flourish''\".<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/>\n\nThe prohibition against Jewish settlement in northern Croatia lasted until 1783, until the [[1782 Edict of Tolerance]] issued by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Monarch]] Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] went into effect. Jews were subsequently allowed to settle in Croatia, but were not allowed to own land or engage in any trade protected by a guild, and were not allowed to work in agriculture.<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/> Despite these measures, Jews settled in [[Zagreb]] and Vara\u017edin.\n\nIn 1840, the Sabor (parliament) voted to ''\"gradually\"'' allow full equality for the Jews, and over the next 33 years there was gradual progress.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1873, [[Ivan Ma\u017eurani\u0107]] signed the decree allowing for the full legal equality of Jews and, as with other faiths, state funds were made available for community institutions.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=893&letter=C&search=croatia Jewish Encyclopedia - Croatia]</ref>\n\nBy 1880, there were 13,488 Jews in Croatia, rising to 20,032 by 1900. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 21 Jewish communities in Croatia, the largest being in Zagreb (3,000 people) and [[Osijek]] (3,000 people). The Jewish community of Croatia became highly successful and integrated. By 1900, 54% of Zagreb Jews and 35% of all Croatian Jews spoke [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as their mother tongue. Despite their small numbers, Jews were disproportionately represented in industrial and wholesale business in Croatia, and in the timber and food industries. Several Jewish families were amongst Croatia's wealthiest families. Despite the apparent wealth, most Jews were middle class, and many second generation Croatian Jews were attracted to the fields of law and medicine.\n\n===World War I===\nWorld War I brought about the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and upheaval for the Jewish communities of the region. After the war, Croatia joined with [[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]] which included [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]], and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nPrior to World War II, the Croatian, and especially the [[Zagreb]] Jewish community, was the preeminent community of Yugoslavia. In 1940 there were about 11,000 Jews living in Zagreb: about 76% were [[Ashkenazi Jews]], 5% [[Sephardi Jews]], 17% unaffiliated and the remainder being [[Haredi Judaism|religious]].<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/>\n\n===The Holocaust===\n{{main article|The Holocaust in Croatia}}\n[[File:Fascist concentration camps in yugoslavia.png|thumb|Concentration camps in Yugoslavia during World War II.]]\n\nOn 25 March 1941, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]], an ethnic Serb, signed Yugoslavia's alliance with the [[Axis Powers]] under the [[Tripartite Pact]].

Prince Paul was overthrown, and a new government under [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] took power. The new government withdrew its support for the Axis but did not repudiate the Tripartite Pact. Nevertheless, Axis forces, led by [[Nazi Germany]], [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] on April 6, 1941.\n\nWith Germany and Italy's support, the Croatian ultra-nationalist [[Usta\u0161e]] movement came to power in the newly established [[puppet state]] called the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH).

A synagogue was built into the western wall of the palace in the 16th century, and descendants of the Salona refugees are still living in the area.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\nOne of the oldest written sources, which could indicate the presence of Jews on Croatian territory, comes from the letter of the vizier [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], which was sent to [[Joseph (Khazar)|King Joseph]] of the [[Khazars]]. This letter from the 10th century refers to the \"King of the Gebalim - Slavs\", see the article [[Miholjanec]], whose country borders the country of the [[Hungarians]]. The King sent a delegation, which included \"Mar ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:\"Lord\") Shaul and Mar Joseph\", to the Caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] of C\u00f3rdoba. Delegates reported that ''mar'' Hisdai Amram came to the Khazar king's palace from the country where the \"Gebalim\" lived. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] \"gebal\" means \"mountain\". Hungarian sources reported, that a [[vineyard]] near Miholjanec was named \"master of the mountain\".

Some of these refugees found their way to Croatia, in particular to [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Dubrovnik]], on the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]].<ref name=\"bh.org.il\"/>\n\n===Habsburg rule===\nIn the 17th century, Jews were still not permitted to settle in northern Croatia. Jews traveled to Croatia as traveling merchants, mostly from neighboring [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]]. They were generally permitted to stay only a few days.<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/> In the early part of the century, the [[Croatian Parliament]] (\"Sabor\") confirmed its ban on permanent settlement when a Jewish family attempted to settle in [[\u0110ur\u0111evac]].<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/>\n\nIn 1753, although still officially banned, Jews were allowed to settle in [[Bjelovar]], [[Koprivnica]] and [[Vara\u017edin]], by General Beck, the military commander of the [[Vara\u017edin county|Vara\u017edin region]]. In order to streamline the treatment of Jews in Croatia, Count Franjo Pata\u010di\u0107, by order of the Royal Office in Vara\u017edin, wrote a comprehensive report advocating Jewish permanent residence in Croatia on the basis that \"''most of them are merchants, and trade makes towns flourish''\".<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/>\n\nThe prohibition against Jewish settlement in northern Croatia lasted until 1783, until the [[1782 Edict of Tolerance]] issued by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Monarch]] Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] went into effect. Jews were subsequently allowed to settle in Croatia, but were not allowed to own land or engage in any trade protected by a guild, and were not allowed to work in agriculture.<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/> Despite these measures, Jews settled in [[Zagreb]] and Vara\u017edin.\n\nIn 1840, the Sabor (parliament) voted to ''\"gradually\"'' allow full equality for the Jews, and over the next 33 years there was gradual progress.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1873, [[Ivan Ma\u017eurani\u0107]] signed the decree allowing for the full legal equality of Jews and, as with other faiths, state funds were made available for community institutions.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=893&letter=C&search=croatia Jewish Encyclopedia - Croatia]</ref>\n\nBy 1880, there were 13,488 Jews in Croatia, rising to 20,032 by 1900. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 21 Jewish communities in Croatia, the largest being in Zagreb (3,000 people) and [[Osijek]] (3,000 people). The Jewish community of Croatia became highly successful and integrated. By 1900, 54% of Zagreb Jews and 35% of all Croatian Jews spoke [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as their mother tongue. Despite their small numbers, Jews were disproportionately represented in industrial and wholesale business in Croatia, and in the timber and food industries. Several Jewish families were amongst Croatia's wealthiest families. Despite the apparent wealth, most Jews were middle class, and many second generation Croatian Jews were attracted to the fields of law and medicine.\n\n===World War I===\nWorld War I brought about the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and upheaval for the Jewish communities of the region. After the war, Croatia joined with [[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]] which included [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]], and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nPrior to World War II, the Croatian, and especially the [[Zagreb]] Jewish community, was the preeminent community of Yugoslavia. In 1940 there were about 11,000 Jews living in Zagreb: about 76% were [[Ashkenazi Jews]], 5% [[Sephardi Jews]], 17% unaffiliated and the remainder being [[Haredi Judaism|religious]].<ref name=\"centropa.org\"/>\n\n===The Holocaust===\n{{main article|The Holocaust in Croatia}}\n[[File:Fascist concentration camps in yugoslavia.png|thumb|Concentration camps in Yugoslavia during World War II.]]\n\nOn 25 March 1941, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]], an ethnic Serb, signed Yugoslavia's alliance with the [[Axis Powers]] under the [[Tripartite Pact]].

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film has received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth, transmitting the virus to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.

The film received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth, transmitting the virus to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.

He was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1892 as A.R.A. and was an active, if intermittent, member of the [[Art Workers Guild]]. He was a central figure in the British movement known as [[New Sculpture]].\n\n==Biography==\nBates was born on 26 April 1850 in [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. He began his career as a carver's assistant, and before beginning the regular study of plastic art he passed through a long apprenticeship in [[Architecture|architectural]] decoration working from 1869 for the firm of [[Farmer & Brindley]].\n\nIn 1879 he went to London and entered the [[South London School of Technical Art]] (formerly known as [[Lambeth School of Art]], now the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]]). There he studied under [[Jules Dalou]]<ref>[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline City and Guilds of London Art School History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004090631/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=4 October 2011 }}</ref> and won a silver medal in the national competition at [[South Kensington]]. \nIn 1881, he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy schools]], where in 1883 he won the gold medal and the travelling scholarship with his relief of ''[[Socrates]] teaching the People in the Agora'', which showed grace of line and harmony of composition. He immediately went to [[Paris]], where he took up an independent studio (on Dalou's suggestion) in 1883&ndash;85. \nHe was influenced by Rodin, who advised him on occasion about his work. \nA head and three small bronze panels (the [[Aeneid]]), executed by Bates in Paris, were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], and selected for purchase by the [[Chantrey Bequest]] trustees; but the selection had to be cancelled because they had not been modelled in Britain.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nBates returned to Britain in 1886, and was elected to the [[Art Workers Guild]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Law Courts Birmingham door.jpg|thumb|Bates's figure of Victoria above the [[Victoria Law Courts, Birmingham]]]]\nHis ''[[Aeneas]]'' (1885), ''[[Homer]]'' (1886), three ''[[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]]'' panels and [[Queen Rhodope|Rhodope]] (1887), all showed marked advance in form and dignity. Bates's primary skill lay in the composition and sculpting of relief sculpture, and it is in this medium that he achieved his most technically and aesthetically refined work. \nThe freestanding ideal sculpture remained the most important of sculptural genres, however, and Bates gradually turned to statues such as the 1889 ''Hounds in Leash,'' which is essentially a relief composition translated to three dimensions. In this work, Bates demonstrated his ability to convey muscular intensity and movement and led to his greater success and ambition. \n\nHis next major statue, the 1890 ''[[Pandora]]'', is more truly a figure in the round, and in this work Bates experimented with polychromy and mixed materials, making it self-consciously into a paradigmatic example of his artistic priorities. The box she holds is an actual decorative casket made of ivory and gilt bronze and elaborately carved with scenes from the Pandora legend. \nIt was exhibited in 1890 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and purchased within the following year for the [[Francis Legatt Chantrey#Chantrey Bequest|Chantrey Bequest]].{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nOne of his final commissions was a large bronze statue of [[Queen Victoria]] unveiled in Albert Square in [[Dundee]] shortly after his death.<ref>http://interactive.britishart.yale.edu/victoria-monuments/221/statue-of-queen-victoria</ref> This bronze statue was cast by the Parlanti foundry of London, who had also cast his statue of Lord Roberts in Calcutta.<ref>The West London Observer August 31st 1900\n</ref>\n\nHe died on 30 January 1899 at his residence, 10 Hall Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. He was buried at Stevenage on 4 February.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe portrait-busts of Harry Bates are good pieces of realism: strong, yet delicate in technique, and excellent in character. \nHis statues have a picturesqueness in which the refinement of the sculptor is always felt. Among the chief of these are the fanciful ''Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]'', somewhat overladen with ornament, and the colossal equestrian statue of ''[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]]'' (1896) upon its important pedestal, girdled with a frieze of figures, now set up in [[Calcutta]], and a statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] for [[Dundee]]. But perhaps his masterpiece\u2014in which his interest in polychromy and mixed materials in a format that fused decorative art and sculpture achieved its fullest realization\u2014was an allegorical presentment of ''Love and Life'', a winged male figure in [[bronze]], with a female figure in ivory being crowned by the male.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBates died in London on 30 January 1899, his premature death robbing English plastic art of its most promising representative at the time.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe is primarily remembered as one of the most important sculptors working with the traditions of the decorative arts within the [[New Sculpture]] movement. \nBoth through his innovative use of polychromy and his allusive subject matter, he is often understood to be one of primary representatives of international Symbolism within British sculpture.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"text-align: center\" heights=\"150\" mode=packed>\nFile:Harry Bates - Pandora, 1891, left - on temporary display at Tate Britain, August 2010.png|Statue of ''[[Pandora]]'', 1891, owned by [[Tate Britain]], [[London]]\nFile:Boys with Coat of Arms by Harry Bates, Moorgate Place Entrance of Chartered Accountants' Hall.jpg|Boys with Coat of Arms, Moorgate Place Entrance of [[Chartered Accountants' Hall]]\nFile:Statue of Earl Roberts, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow.jpg|Statue of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]], 1896, [[Kelvingrove Park]], [[Glasgow]]\nFile:Statue of Queen Victoria, Albert Square, Dundee by Harry Bates 1899.jpg|Statue of [[Queen Victoria]], 1899, [[Albert Square]], [[Dundee]]\nFile:EB1911 Plate III. v24, pg.504, Fig 4.jpg|Sculpture of [[Homer]], 1886<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], ed. 1911, vol. 24, pg. 504, Plate III.</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Bates, Harry |volume=3 |page=509}}\n*{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Bates, Harry|volume=1|first=Ernest|last=Radford|pages=140\u2013141}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beattie, Susan.

He was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1892 as A.R.A. and was an active, if intermittent, member of the [[Art Workers Guild]]. He was a central figure in the British movement known as [[New Sculpture]].\n\n==Biography==\nBates was born on 26 April 1850 in [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. He began his career as a carver's assistant, and before beginning the regular study of plastic art he passed through a long apprenticeship in [[Architecture|architectural]] decoration working from 1869 for the firm of [[Farmer & Brindley]].\n\nIn 1879 he went to London and entered the [[South London School of Technical Art]] (formerly known as [[Lambeth School of Art]], now the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]]). There he studied under [[Jules Dalou]]<ref>[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline City and Guilds of London Art School History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004090631/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=4 October 2011 }}</ref> and won a silver medal in the national competition at [[South Kensington]]. \nIn 1881, he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy schools]], where in 1883 he won the gold medal and the travelling scholarship with his relief of ''[[Socrates]] teaching the People in the Agora'', which showed grace of line and harmony of composition. He immediately went to [[Paris]], where he took up an independent studio (on Dalou's suggestion) in 1883&ndash;85. \nHe was influenced by Rodin, who advised him on occasion about his work. \nA head and three small bronze panels (the [[Aeneid]]), executed by Bates in Paris, were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], and selected for purchase by the [[Chantrey Bequest]] trustees; but the selection had to be cancelled because they had not been modelled in Britain.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nBates returned to Britain in 1886, and was elected to the [[Art Workers Guild]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Law Courts Birmingham door.jpg|thumb|Bates's figure of Victoria above the [[Victoria Law Courts, Birmingham]]]]\nHis ''[[Aeneas]]'' (1885), ''[[Homer]]'' (1886), three ''[[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]]'' panels and [[Queen Rhodope|Rhodope]] (1887), all showed marked advance in form and dignity. Bates's primary skill lay in the composition and sculpting of relief sculpture, and it is in this medium that he achieved his most technically and aesthetically refined work. \nThe freestanding ideal sculpture remained the most important of sculptural genres, however, and Bates gradually turned to statues such as the 1889 ''Hounds in Leash,'' which is essentially a relief composition translated to three dimensions. In this work, Bates demonstrated his ability to convey muscular intensity and movement and led to his greater success and ambition. \n\nHis next major statue, the 1890 ''[[Pandora]]'', is more truly a figure in the round, and in this work Bates experimented with polychromy and mixed materials, making it self-consciously into a paradigmatic example of his artistic priorities. The box she holds is an actual decorative casket made of ivory and gilt bronze and elaborately carved with scenes from the Pandora legend. \nIt was exhibited in 1890 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and purchased within the following year for the [[Francis Legatt Chantrey#Chantrey Bequest|Chantrey Bequest]].{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nOne of his final commissions was a large bronze statue of [[Queen Victoria]] unveiled in Albert Square in [[Dundee]] shortly after his death.<ref>http://interactive.britishart.yale.edu/victoria-monuments/221/statue-of-queen-victoria</ref>\n\nHe died on 30 January 1899 at his residence, 10 Hall Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. He was buried at Stevenage on 4 February.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe portrait-busts of Harry Bates are good pieces of realism: strong, yet delicate in technique, and excellent in character. \nHis statues have a picturesqueness in which the refinement of the sculptor is always felt. Among the chief of these are the fanciful ''Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]'', somewhat overladen with ornament, and the colossal equestrian statue of ''[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]]'' (1896) upon its important pedestal, girdled with a frieze of figures, now set up in [[Calcutta]], and a statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] for [[Dundee]]. But perhaps his masterpiece\u2014in which his interest in polychromy and mixed materials in a format that fused decorative art and sculpture achieved its fullest realization\u2014was an allegorical presentment of ''Love and Life'', a winged male figure in [[bronze]], with a female figure in ivory being crowned by the male.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBates died in London on 30 January 1899, his premature death robbing English plastic art of its most promising representative at the time.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe is primarily remembered as one of the most important sculptors working with the traditions of the decorative arts within the [[New Sculpture]] movement. \nBoth through his innovative use of polychromy and his allusive subject matter, he is often understood to be one of primary representatives of international Symbolism within British sculpture.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"text-align: center\" heights=\"150\" mode=packed>\nFile:Harry Bates - Pandora, 1891, left - on temporary display at Tate Britain, August 2010.png|Statue of ''[[Pandora]]'', 1891, owned by [[Tate Britain]], [[London]]\nFile:Boys with Coat of Arms by Harry Bates, Moorgate Place Entrance of Chartered Accountants' Hall.jpg|Boys with Coat of Arms, Moorgate Place Entrance of [[Chartered Accountants' Hall]]\nFile:Statue of Earl Roberts, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow.jpg|Statue of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]], 1896, [[Kelvingrove Park]], [[Glasgow]]\nFile:Statue of Queen Victoria, Albert Square, Dundee by Harry Bates 1899.jpg|Statue of [[Queen Victoria]], 1899, [[Albert Square]], [[Dundee]]\nFile:EB1911 Plate III. v24, pg.504, Fig 4.jpg|Sculpture of [[Homer]], 1886<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], ed. 1911, vol. 24, pg. 504, Plate III.</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Bates, Harry |volume=3 |page=509}}\n*{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Bates, Harry|volume=1|first=Ernest|last=Radford|pages=140\u2013141}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beattie, Susan.

Secondly, that it should have a Spiritual significance. The surmounting figure on the cenotaph represents Glory to the Dead, holding the torch of Freedom for which they died. The sorrowing Love on the Shrine at the base, will, I think, appeal to all who have lost dear ones in the War. The symbol over the Cross is an old Celtic sign for the Voice or Presence of God\".

While it is not known precisely where they settled, this is considered to be the establishment of the Jewish community in the region. \n\nThe first Jewish presence in Antwerp is attested to by the will of Henry III, the [[Duke of Brabant]] and [[Margraviate of Antwerp|Margrave of Antwerp]], who in 1261 expressed his wish that the Jews of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] should be expelled and destroyed because they were all considered \"usurers\".\n\nIn the mid-14th century, John III, the Duke of Brabant, conducted a massive anti-Jewish campaign in [[Brussels]] and [[Leuven]] and drove them from the city.\n\nA new group of Jewish immigrants started to settle in Antwerp in the early 16th century, when the city became a relatively safe haven for [[crypto-Jew]]s fleeing the persecutions and the expulsions in the Iberian Peninsula. An often tenuous presence was maintained for the next century and a half, although Jews were not allowed to acquire citizenship and persecution was common.\n\nIt was not until 1794 and with the arrival of the [[French Revolution]] that Jews could settle freely in Antwerp again. The current Jewish community of Antwerp was officially established in 1816, when there were about one hundred Jews living in the city. This, the first legally recognized community, was known as the Jewish Community (Communaut\u00e9 Israelite). The first Jewish public prayers were held in the private home of Moise Kreyn, having received the approval of the city authorities. The Jews of Antwerp acquired possession of a cemetery in 1828. There were 151 Jews living in Antwerp in 1829.\n\nDuring the Second World War, 65% of the city's Jews perished in the Holocaust (vs. only 35% of Jews from Brussels). On April 14, 1941, the so-called \"Antwerp pogrom\" occurred when some 200 followers of the ''[[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]]'' (\"Flemish National Union\"), ''[[Volksverwering]]'' (\"People's Defense\"), Anti-Jewish League and other pro-Nazi anti-Semitic groups burned two synagogues in the Oosten straat, smashed the windows of Jewish-owned shops, damaged religious symbols and harassed the Jewish population.<ref>{{cite book|first=Aristotle|last=Kallis|title=Genocide and Fascism: The Eliminationist Drive in Fascist Europe|publisher= Routledge|year=2009|page=280}}</ref> In May\u2013September 1942, some 1500 Jewish men from Antwerp were taken into forced labor in Northern France, building the \"Atlantic Wall\" for the [[Organisation Todt]]. From the end of July until November 1942, on three different occasions, Jews in Antwerp were rounded up by the Germans with the collaboration of the local police. From a community of around 35,000 Jews in Antwerp before the war, some 15,000 remained in the city after 1945.\n\n{{See also|The Holocaust in Belgium}}\n\n==Present==\nThe Jewish community of Antwerp consists of around 18,000 members. The majority of residents identifying themselves as Jewish belong to traditional or Orthodox communities, although levels of religious practice vary. The Haredi, or [[Ultra-Orthodox Judaism|ultra-orthodox Jews]], traditionally tend to live concentrated in the city center in an area close to the [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station|Antwerp Central railway station]]. This neighborhood is also sometimes known as \"Jewish Antwerp\" ({{lang-nl|Joods Antwerpen}}). Its main attraction is its close proximity to the diamond bourse, where in earlier days a large part of the community worked. It is also where the Jewish schools, kosher food outlets, and general Jewish amenities are located.\n\nIn recent years many of the younger generation of secular Jews have moved away from the crowded city center. There has also been small but steady growth of Orthodox satellite communities in suburbs such as [[Edegem]], [[Wilrijk]] and [[Brasschaat]]. This may cause the Antwerp community to seem overwhelmingly Haredi to the casual observer. After [[New York City]], [[London]] and [[Paris]], Antwerp is one of the largest communities of [[Haredi Jews]] outside Israel.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nWithin the prominently-[[ashkenazi]] religious community there are two religious councils, known as kehillas; and a small sefardi council:\n* The Isra\u00eblitische Gemeente van Antwerpen ''Shomre Hadass''; primarily oriented toward the Modern Orthodox community. It is led by Chief Rabbi David Moshe Lieberman. This council also espouses the values of religious Zionism and maintains a pro-Israel stance in community affairs.\n* The ''Orthodox Isra\u00eblitische Gemeente Machsike Hadass'' primarily oriented toward the ultra-orthodox [[Haredi]] community.\n* The \"Portuguees Isra\u00eblitische Gemeenschap van Antwerpen\" is the Sefardi religious community. \n\nThe late Rabbi [[Chaim Kreiswirth]], was the [[Chief Rabbi]] of the Machzikei Hadass kehilla for many years and was widely regarded as a pre-eminent scholar of Talmud. He died in 2001 and was replaced by Rabbi Rubinstein of Israel, who died a few months after being nominated to the post. Since December 2010, the position has been filled by Rabbi [[Aaron Schiff]].

The Pshevorsker [[Rebbe]], Rabbi Leibish Leiser, lives in Antwerp, as did his predecessors. Pshevorsker Hasidim live mainly in Antwerp, London, and [[Manchester]]; on [[Jewish holidays]] many come to Antwerp to see their rebbe.\n\nThere are also other Hasidic rebbes in Antwerp, including a Spinka Rebbe and a Zhemigrader Rebbe. These groups have rebbes in other locations as well.\n\n==Non-Hasidic Jews==\nAlthough the Jews not aligned to any Hasidic group probably no longer greatly outnumber the Hasidim, they have a substantial presence. The three major synagogues in Antwerp, known locally by their addresses, The Van Den Nestlei and the Bouwmeesterstraat (pictured above) shuls of the Shomre Hadass and the Oostenstraat shul, are not aligned to any Hasidic movement.\n\nThere is a small [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] community. Furthermore, there are organisations of [[Georgian Jews]], a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] synagogue, and [[Secular Jewish culture|non-religious Jewish]] organizations.\n\n==Eruv==\nAs in other cities with large Jewish communities, [[Antwerp]] is surrounded by a wire called \"[[eruv]]\" (Eiroew in Dutch). In contrast to the eruvs in [[New York City]] or other large cities, the [[Antwerp]] eruv surrounds the whole city center. The presence of this eruv allows Jews to interpret the city as one big house, making it easier to avoid breaking some Sabbath regulations within it. The wire constituting the eruv can be found close to the Singel at a height of 6 meters, and at the entrance of the Diamond district.<ref>[http://antwerphoto.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/antwerps-eruv/ Antwerp's Eruv/ Antwerp] Retrieved 25 January 2013.</ref>\n\n==Schools==\nA number of Jewish schools are found throughout the Jewish district (95% of the Jewish children of Antwerp receive a religious education). The three main Jewish schools in Antwerp are the Yesode Hatora of the Machsike Hadas, and the Yavne and Tachkemoni schools of the Shomre Hadas.\n\nThe Yesode Hatora - Beth Jacob population is composed primarily of students from Hasidic, Haredi, and Orthodox backgrounds. It provides instruction in religious as well as secular studies: students follow a dual curriculum starting in pre-school/kindergarten, through primary school and secondary school. Established in 1903, it is the oldest of Antwerp's Jewish schools and has the highest population of Jewish students. Students are educated in accordance with the values of Orthodox Judaism and fulfill the educational requirements of the Belgian Ministry of Education. The student population is separated by gender; male students attend Yesode Hatora and female students attend Beth Jacob. In accordance with the religious ideology that puts little value on secular learning, the school actively discourages the pursuit of secular higher education.\n\nThe Yavne school is aligned with the religious Zionist movement. Similar to Yesode Hatora/Beth Jacob, the Yavne school follows a dual curriculum composed of religious and secular studies. Students are educated in accordance with the values of religious Zionism and fulfill the educational requirements of the Belgian Ministry of Education. The school is not mixed; male students attend the Yeshiva Tichonit and females the Ulpena Lebanot. An estimated 98% of Yavne students typically emigrate to Israel (commonly referred to in Jewish communities as \"making ''[[aliyah]]''\") within one year of graduation from secondary school. In recent years, far-reaching improvements have been achieved in the secular curriculum. Religious instruction also adheres to high standards and a widely developed curriculum.\n\nThe Tachkemoni is a fully co-educational school, attracting students from primarily secular Jewish backgrounds and some modern-orthodox families. Its high level of Hebrew and serious preparation for the Jerusalem Examination (Bechina Yerushalmit) administered by the Jewish Agency and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem makes it one of the finest Jewish educational institutions in Europe. Most graduates pursue university studies after completing secondary school and many spend a year in Israel. Tachkemoni was founded in 1920 by Rabbi Moshe Avigdor Amiel, a moderate religious Zionist. His vision of a strong Jewish education along with a good secular education is still part of the culture of Tachkemoni.\n\nIn addition there are several [[kollelim]], where married men can continue their studies. The famed haredi [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (Wilrijk)|Etz Chaim Yeshiva]], where hundreds of young men from around the world study, is now located in the [[Wilrijk]] district, having previously been in the Antwerp suburban towns, first of Heide then Kapellen.\n\nMany [[synagogues]], schools, [[Tzedakah|charities]] and social groups care for the environment. A majority of Jews living in Antwerp are multilingual and communicate in a variety of languages. [[Yiddish]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew]], [[English language|English]] and German are all widely spoken among members of the community, as well as [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The Jewish community of Antwerp did not immediately adopt the locally spoken [[Dutch language]] as their common spoken language. Instead, in line with the people they worked with in the diamond trade, they spoke French, the language of commerce in Antwerp until after World War II. In recent years English has taken over as the common language of choice, while stricter enforcement of local language regulations ensure that all children are fluent in Dutch. The use of language in Antwerp's Jewish community is a complex issue: while community members possess fair knowledge of different languages, there is a lack of uniformity when it comes to effective communication and discussion in a common language.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe Jewish community in Antwerp has maintained a strong and active presence in the local diamond trade. After [[World War II]], Belgian Jewish survivors as well as others from Eastern Europe settled in Antwerp and built up an influential and highly successful stake in the diamond business. Whether through established diamond trading offices, cutting and polishing factories, or as diamond brokers, Antwerp's Jews established themselves as capable businessmen and -women.\n\nOver the course of the past decade, however, much of the wholesale diamond trade has been taken over by the Jain Indian community. With easy access to manufacturing centers in India, where production costs are significantly cheaper, the Jewish community has lost some of its influence as far as the diamond trade is concerned. However, the diamond business remains a common profession shared by most of the members of the Jewish community.\n\nThe future of Antwerp's Jewish community is uncertain, with a record number of Jews opting for residence in Israel and to a lesser extent in the United States and the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Community publications==\n*''[[Joods Actueel]]'' is a family-owned and operated monthly magazine led by General Director Terry Davids and Managing Editor Michael Zevi Freilich.\n*''Kehilatenu'', published weekly by the Shomre Hadass, in Dutch, contains sections on the portion of the week, including community news.\n*''Shabbat b'Shabbato'', published weekly by the Machzikei Hadass, in Hebrew and Yiddish. It is commonly perused by synagogue attendants at Sabbath services.\n*''Lema'an Teida'', a Yiddish weekly e-newsletter written by Pinchas Kornfeld, consists primarily of editorial content.\n\n==Dining and restaurants==\nThere are a variety of [[kosher]] restaurants located in and around Antwerp's Jewish area, including a vegetarian kosher restaurant called Beni Falafel, a dairy restaurant called Mama Mia, a pizzeria called Time Out, a kosher steakhouse called Lama Lo, a kosher Chinese restaurant Blue Lagoon. Rivi's and Hoffys.\n\n==Antisemitism in the 21st Century==\nDuring November 2013 alone, six anti-semitic incidents were recorded throughout Antwerp. These include the chasing of Jewish children and the attack of an old Jewish woman. All the incidents were committed by men of Middle Eastern or North African descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.org.il/article/83497/harassment-against-jews|title=Harassment against Jews|last=|first=|date=|website=antisemitism.org.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pshevorsk]]\u2013Hasidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\n*[[History of the Jews in Belgium]]\n*[[Eisenman Synagogue]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dubin, Lois. \"Introduction: Port Jews in the Atlantic world Jewish history.\" ''Jewish History'' 20.2 (2006): 117\u2013127.\n* {{cite book|author=Isidore Singer and Cyrus Adler, eds.|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ/page/n692 658]\u201360}}\n\n* Vanden Daelen, V. \"Antwerp Jews and the Diamond Trade: Jews shaping Diamonds or Diamonds shaping Jews.\" ''XIV International Economic History Congress in Helsinki, Finland.'' 2006.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/world/europe/06iht-journal.1.19121244.html?_r=1 Antwerp's Jewish enclave adjusts]\n*[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Belgium.html Virtual Jewish History Tour of Belgium]\n*[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=51&story_id=11944 Expatica - Jewish Antwerp]\n*[http://jewishbelgium.org/city.asp?citymenu=Antwerp Travelling to Jewish Antwerp] {{Dead link|date=July 2016}}\n*[http://www.edwardvictor.com/Belgium.htm Pictures of The Bouweesterstraat synagogue]\n*[http://www.bluelagoonkosher.be/ Kosher Chinese Restaurant in Antwerp]\n*[http://antwerphoto.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/antwerps-eruv/ Antwerp's eruv]\n\n{{Antwerp}}\n[[Category:Hasidic Judaism in Europe|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Historic Jewish communities|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:History of Antwerp|Jews]]\n[[Category:Jewish Belgian history]]\n[[Category:Jewish history by city|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in Antwerp| ]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Judaism by city|Antwerp]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[Image:AntwerpenSynagogue.jpg|right|frame|[[Hollandse Synagogue]] in Antwerp]]\n[[Image:Eisenman 008.jpg|thumb|250px|Interior of [[Eisenman Synagogue]]]]\n\nThe '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Antwerp]]''', [[Belgium]] goes back at least eight hundred years.

[[Yiddish]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew]], [[English language|English]] and German are all widely spoken among members of the community, as well as [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The Jewish community of Antwerp did not immediately adopt the locally spoken [[Dutch language]] as their common spoken language. Instead, in line with the people they worked with in the diamond trade, they spoke French, the language of commerce in Antwerp until after World War II. In recent years English has taken over as the common language of choice, while stricter enforcement of local language regulations ensure that all children are fluent in Dutch. The use of language in Antwerp's Jewish community is a complex issue: while community members possess fair knowledge of different languages, there is a lack of uniformity when it comes to effective communication and discussion in a common language.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe Jewish community in Antwerp has maintained a strong and active presence in the local diamond trade. After [[World War II]], Belgian Jewish survivors as well as others from Eastern Europe settled in Antwerp and built up an influential and highly successful stake in the diamond business. Whether through established diamond trading offices, cutting and polishing factories, or as diamond brokers, Antwerp's Jews established themselves as capable businessmen and -women.\n\nOver the course of the past decade, however, much of the wholesale diamond trade has been taken over by the Jain Indian community. With easy access to manufacturing centers in India, where production costs are significantly cheaper, the Jewish community has lost some of its influence as far as the diamond trade is concerned. However, the diamond business remains a common profession shared by most of the members of the Jewish community.\n\nThe future of Antwerp's Jewish community is uncertain, with a record number of Jews opting for residence in Israel and to a lesser extent in the United States and the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Community publications==\n*''[[Joods Actueel]]'' is a family-owned and operated monthly magazine led by General Director Terry Davids and Managing Editor Michael Zevi Freilich.\n*''Kehilatenu'', published weekly by the Shomre Hadass, in Dutch, contains sections on the portion of the week, including community news.\n*''Shabbat b'Shabbato'', published weekly by the Machzikei Hadass, in Hebrew and Yiddish. It is commonly perused by synagogue attendants at Sabbath services.\n*''Lema'an Teida'', a Yiddish weekly e-newsletter written by Pinchas Kornfeld, consists primarily of editorial content.\n\n==Dining and restaurants==\nThere are a variety of [[kosher]] restaurants located in and around Antwerp's Jewish area, including a vegetarian kosher restaurant called Beni Falafel, a dairy restaurant called Mama Mia, a pizzeria called Time Out, a kosher steakhouse called Lama Lo, a kosher Chinese restaurant Blue Lagoon. Rivi's and Hoffys.\n\n==Antisemitism in the 21st Century==\nDuring November 2013 alone, six anti-semitic incidents were recorded throughout Antwerp. These include the chasing of Jewish children and the attack of an old Jewish woman. All the incidents were committed by men of Middle Eastern or North African descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.org.il/article/83497/harassment-against-jews|title=Harassment against Jews|last=|first=|date=|website=antisemitism.org.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pshevorsk]]\u2013Hasidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\n*[[History of the Jews in Belgium]]\n*[[Eisenman Synagogue]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dubin, Lois. \"Introduction: Port Jews in the Atlantic world Jewish history.\" ''Jewish History'' 20.2 (2006): 117-127.\n* {{cite book|author=Isidore Singer and Cyrus Adler, eds.|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ/page/n692 658]\u201360}}\n\n* Vanden Daelen, V. \"Antwerp Jews and the Diamond Trade: Jews shaping Diamonds or Diamonds shaping Jews.\" ''XIV International Economic History Congress in Helsinki, Finland.'' 2006.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/world/europe/06iht-journal.1.19121244.html?_r=1 Antwerp's Jewish enclave adjusts]\n*[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Belgium.html Virtual Jewish History Tour of Belgium]\n*[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=51&story_id=11944 Expatica - Jewish Antwerp]\n*[http://jewishbelgium.org/city.asp?citymenu=Antwerp Travelling to Jewish Antwerp] {{Dead link|date=July 2016}}\n*[http://www.edwardvictor.com/Belgium.htm Pictures of The Bouweesterstraat synagogue]\n*[http://www.bluelagoonkosher.be/ Kosher Chinese Restaurant in Antwerp]\n*[http://antwerphoto.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/antwerps-eruv/ Antwerp's eruv]\n\n{{Antwerp}}\n[[Category:Hasidic Judaism in Europe|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Historic Jewish communities|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:History of Antwerp|Jews]]\n[[Category:Jewish Belgian history]]\n[[Category:Jewish history by city|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in Antwerp| ]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Judaism by city|Antwerp]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: zionist \u2192 Zionist, 117-127 \u2192 117\u2013127", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Antwerp"}

The sides of the stump are decorated with small figures of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and fairies. Barrie had intended the boy to be based on a photograph of [[Michael Llewelyn Davies]] wearing a Peter Pan costume, but Frampton chose another model, possibly James W. Shaw or William A. Harwood. Barrie was disappointed by the results, claiming the statue \"didn't show the Devil in Peter\".<ref>Birkin, Andrew: ''J. M.
