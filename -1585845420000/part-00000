Urban areas are created through [[urbanization]] and are categorized by [[urban morphology]] as [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, [[conurbation]]s or [[suburbs]]. In [[urbanism]], the term contrasts to [[rural area]]s such as [[village]]s and [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]]; in [[urban sociology]] or [[urban anthropology]] it contrasts with [[natural environment]]. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the [[urban revolution]] led to the creation of human [[civilization]] with modern [[urban planning]], which along with other human activities such as [[exploitation of natural resources]] led to a [[human impact on the environment]]. \"Agglomeration effects\" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baten|first=Joerg|date=2003|title=Creating Firms for a New Century: Determinants of Firm Creation around 1900|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/issue.|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=7|issue=3|pages=301\u2013329|via=EBSCO|doi=10.1017/S136149160300011X}}</ref>\n\nThe world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since.<ref name=\"UrbanPopulation\">{{cite news|title=City population to reach 6.4bn by 2050|url=http://www.heraldglobe.com/index.php/sid/223727231/scat/2411cd3571b4f088/ht/City-population-to-reach-64bn-by-2050|accessdate=11 July 2014|work=Herald Globe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714211145/http://www.heraldglobe.com/index.php/sid/223727231/scat/2411cd3571b4f088/ht/City-population-to-reach-64bn-by-2050|archive-date=2014-07-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/urbanization/urban-rural.shtml|title=United Nations Population Division \u2013 Department of Economic and Social Affairs|publisher=}}</ref> This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gho/urban_health/situation_trends/urban_population_growth_text/en/ |title= Urban population growth |publisher= World Health Organization}}</ref> In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet,<ref name=\"WorldPopulation\">{{cite news |title= Current world population |url= http://www.geohive.com/earth/population_now.aspx |accessdate= 11 July 2014 |publisher= United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140702055710/http://www.geohive.com/earth/population_now.aspx |archivedate= 2 July 2014 }}</ref> of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion.

One of the first word used was the word agglom\u00e9ration, which first was used to deal with a group of people.\nThe word was used for instance in the law from 5 april 1884 (loi du 5 avril 1884) whose article 98 gives to the mayor police power (''pouvoirs de police'', where French ''police'' word comes from the latin word ''politia'' or from the greec word ''\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2'' both retalted to the city) meaning authority on the city, but only within the ''agglom\u00e9ration''. \nThat law was used by a jurisprudence from year 1907 to forbid a mayor to set a speed limit on the road next to a farm considering that at that time, a group of houses inside a farm might be an ''agglom\u00e9ration'', but the road next to it was not inside the ''agglom\u00e9ration''.<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5809154m/f31.item</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5752228f/f13.item |title = Gallica - Erreur}}</ref>. \n\nLater, in the 1920s, the concept of ''agglom\u00e9ration'' was used in the ''code de la route'' (Highway code) to define specific law within/outside such a zone.\n\nIn 1968, the French word ''agglom\u00e9ration'' was introduced in the French version of the Vienna convention on road traffic in the place where the English word ''built-up area'' was used in the English version of this exact same treaty. In this treaty, the word is only defined as a concept signaled by an entry sign and an exist sign, even if allowing members of the treaty to have different definition.\n\nNowadays, with globalisation words from English origin or english meaning tend to be introduced in French language to introcuce in France new concepts or new words or new meanings for old words and/or to change the size and the power a mayor can have. Such words are Aire urbaines (urban area), M\u00e9tropole, Agglom\u00e9ration (agglomeration), Communaut\u00e9 urbaine, Gand something (Grand Paris, Grand Toulouse), and probably other words.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, the OECD and the European Union, for statistical purpose, France might need to cope with ''inside/outside built-up area'' meaning inside/outside the limits of an urban area.\n\nIn [[France]], an urban area (''Fr: [[aire urbaine]]'') is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an \"urban unit\" (''[[unit\u00e9 urbaine]]'')<ref name=\"unit\u00e9 urbaine\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.insee.fr/en/metadonnees/definition/c1501|website=Definitions, methods and quality |title=Urban unit| accessdate=2019-01-18|date=October 31, 2016|language=en|publisher=INSEE}}</ref> \u2013 close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (''[[couronne p\u00e9riurbaine|couronne]]'').

Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).<ref name=popcentre /> Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n\n====United States====\n{{main|List of United States urban areas}}\nIn the United States, there are two categories of urban area.

For example, the city of [[Greenville, South Carolina]] has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000&nbsp;\u2014 meaning that Greenville is actually \"larger\" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc.\n\nIn the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[natural resources inventory]], urban areas are officially known as '''developed areas''' or urban and built-up areas.

One of the first word used was the word agglom\u00e9ration, which first was used to deal with a group of people.\nThe word was used for instance in the law from 5 april 1884 (loi du 5 avril 1884) whose article 98 gives to the mayor police power (''pouvoirs de police'', where French ''police'' word comes from the latin word ''politia'' or from the greec word ''\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2'' both retalted to the city) meaning authority on the city, but only within the ''agglom\u00e9ration''. \nThat law was used by a jurisprudence from year 1907 to forbid a mayor to set a speed limit on the road next to a farm considering that at that time, a group of houses inside a farm might be an ''agglom\u00e9ration'', but the road next to it was not inside the ''agglom\u00e9ration''.<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5809154m/f31.item</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5752228f/f13.item |title = Gallica - Erreur}}</ref>. \n\nLater, in the 1920s, the concept of ''agglom\u00e9ration'' was used in the ''code de la route'' (Highway code) to define specific law within/outside such a zone.\n\nIn 1968, the French word ''agglom\u00e9ration'' was introduced in the French version of the Vienna convention on road traffic in the place where the English word ''built-up area'' was used in the English version of this exact same treaty. In this treaty, the word is only defined as a concept signaled by an entry sign and an exist sign, even if allowing members of the treaty to have different definition.\n\nNowadays, with globalisation words from English origin or english meaning tend to be introduced in French language to introcuce in France new concepts or new words or new meanings for old words and/or to change the size and the power a mayor can have. Such words are Aire urbaines (urban area), M\u00e9tropole, Agglom\u00e9ration (agglomeration), Communaut\u00e9 urbaine, Gand something (Grand Paris, Grand Toulouse), and probably other words.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, the OECD and the European Union, for statistical purpose, France might need to cope with ''inside/outside built-up area'' meaning inside/outside the limits of an urban area.\n\nIn [[France]], an urban area (''Fr: [[aire urbaine]]'') is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an \"urban unit\" (''[[unit\u00e9 urbaine]]'')<ref name=\"unit\u00e9 urbaine\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.insee.fr/en/metadonnees/definition/c1501|website=Definitions, methods and quality |title=Urban unit| accessdate=2019-01-18|date=October 31, 2016|language=en|publisher=INSEE}}</ref> \u2013 close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (''[[couronne p\u00e9riurbaine|couronne]]'').

Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).<ref name=popcentre /> Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n\n====United States====\n{{main|List of United States urban areas}}\nIn the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term ''urbanized area'' denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called ''urban clusters''. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371 [[List of United States urban areas|urban areas and urban clusters]] with more than 10,000 people.\n\nThe [[U.S. Census Bureau]] defines an urban area as \"core census block groups or [[census block|blocks]] that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/GARM/Ch12GARM.pdf|title=The Urban and Rural Classifications|last=|first=|date=|website=Geographic Areas Reference Manual|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe largest urban area in the United States is the [[New York metropolitan area]].

For example, the city of [[Greenville, South Carolina]] has a city population just over 64,000 and an urbanized area population of over 800,000, while [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000&nbsp;\u2014 meaning that Greenville is actually \"larger\" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc.\n\nIn the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[natural resources inventory]], urban areas are officially known as '''developed areas''' or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas.

He is best known for claiming to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] with his expedition on April 6, 1909.\n\nPeary was born in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], but following his father's death at a young age, was raised in [[Portland, Maine]].  He went to a prominent boarding school called Loomis Chaffe. He attended [[Bowdoin College]], then joined the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] as a draftsman. Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881, as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] (which was never built). Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross [[Greenland]] by [[dogsled]]. [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892|He returned in 1891]] much better prepared, and by reaching [[Independence Fjord]] (in what is now known as [[Peary Land]]) proved conclusively that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study [[Inuit]] survival techniques.\n\nOn his 1898\u20131902 expedition, Peary set a new \"[[Farthest North]]\" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, [[Cape Morris Jesup]]. Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905\u20131906 and in 1908\u20131909. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received a number of awards from [[Learned society|geographical societies]] during his lifetime, and in 1911 received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. He served two terms as president of [[The Explorers Club]] and retired to [[Eagle Island (Casco Bay, Maine)|Eagle Island]].\n\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in contemporary newspapers (along with a competing claim made by [[Frederick Cook]]), but eventually won widespread acceptance. In 1989, British explorer [[Wally Herbert]] concluded Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as {{convert|60|mi|km|0}}. His conclusions have been widely accepted, although disputed by some authorities.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\n[[File:Peary.jpg|thumb|alt= Photographic portrait of Peary |Peary {{circa|1900}}]]\nRobert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], to Charles N. and Mary P.

After Peary's death, his boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument.

The second, more difficult path, was to start from [[Whale Sound]] at the top of the known portion of [[Baffin Bay]] and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic.<ref name=Mills511/> Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.<ref name=NavalHistory/>\n\n==Initial Arctic expeditions==\nPeary made his first expedition to the [[Arctic]] in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by [[dog sled]], taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a [[whaler]] to Greenland, arriving in [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]] on June 6, 1886.<ref name=Mills510/> Peary wanted to make a solo trek, but a young Danish official named Christian Maigaard convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland's ice sheet at the time. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.<ref name=Mills511>Mills 2003, p.&nbsp;511.</ref>\n\n[[File:Matthew Henson 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Photograph of Matthew Henson dressed in polar gear | [[Matthew Henson]], Peary's assistant, in 1910]]\nBack in Washington attending with the US Navy, in November 1887 Peary was ordered  to survey likely routes for a proposed Nicaragua Canal.

By wearing furs to preserve body heat and building igloos, he was able to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march.  Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system\u2014which he called the \"Peary system\"\u2014of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by their body odor (they did not bathe), their flea infestations and their food.

With insufficient food, and  uncertainty whether he could negotiate the ice between himself and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life from the melting ice. On April 20, he was no farther north than 86\u00b030' latitude. For obvious reasons, this latitude was never published by Peary.

Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back\u2014which would have assisted his claim of such speed\u2014is contradicted by his companion Henson's account of tortured detours to avoid \"pressure ridges\" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and \"leads\" (open water between those floes).\n\nIn his official report, Peary claimed to have traveled a total of  304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909, (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), {{convert|133|nmi|km}} to the pole, the same distance back, and {{convert|38|nmi|km}} in the vicinity of the pole.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance traveled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of {{convert|304|nmi|km}} more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which\u2014like [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s a month later in 1912\u2014was supported by the sextant, [[theodolite]], and compass observations of several other navigators.\n\n====Review of Peary's diary====\n[[File:Diary of Robert E. Peary - NARA - 304960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt= Photograph of Peary's diary entry for his arrival at the North pole | Peary's diary entry for arrival at the [[North Pole]]]]\nThe diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian [[Larry Schweikart]] examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), that there were consistent [[pemmican]] and other stains on all pages, and that all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer [[Naomi Uemura]], who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent.<ref>[[Larry Schweikart]], \"Polar Revisionism and the Peary Claim: The Diary of Robert E. Peary,\" ''The Historian'', XLVIII, May 1986.</ref> However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days of April 6 and 7, 1909, and his famous words \"The Pole at Last!\", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.\n\n====1984 and 1989 National Geographic Society studies====\nIn 1984 the National Geographic Society (a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions) commissioned the Arctic explorer [[Wally Herbert]] to write an assessment of Peary's original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary must have falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the Pole.<ref name=\":1\" /> His book, ''The Noose of Laurels'', caused a furor when it was published in 1989. If Peary did not reach the pole in 1909, Herbert himself would claim the record of being the first to reach the pole on foot.<ref name=\"Herbert\">American Polar Society: Sir Wally Herbert].

Peary's original camera (a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak) has not survived. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens\u2014and hence the shadow analysis based on it\u2014must be considered uncertain at best.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The NGS has never released Peary's photos for an independent analysis. Specialists questioned the Society's conclusions.<ref>\"Washington Post\", December 12, 1989; \"Scientific American\", March and June, 1990</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue. Their 1989 report concluded that Peary had indeed reached the Pole.  Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NGS, said, \"I consider this the end of a historic controversy and the confirmation of due justice to a great explorer.\"<ref>Thomas D. Davies, ''Robert E. Peary At The North Pole'', Starpath Publications, 17 Dec 2009; {{ISBN|9780914025207}}</ref>\n\n====Review of depth soundings====\nSupporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed.<ref>[http://www.matthewhenson.com/northpoleproofDEPTH2.htm \"Proof Henson & Peary reached Pole\"], ''Matthew A Henson website''. Retrieved August 11, 2007.</ref> Only the first few of the Peary party's soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}<ref>Peary's expedition possessed 4000 fathoms of sounding line, but he took only 2000 with him over an ocean already established as being deeper in many regions. See, D. Rawlins, ''U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings'', June 1970, p.&nbsp;38, and ''Polar Notes'' (Dartmouth College), volume 10, October, 1970, p.&nbsp;38.</ref> Peary stated (in 1909 Congressional hearings about the expedition) that he made no longitudinal observations during his trip, only latitude observations, yet he maintained he stayed on the \"Columbia meridian\" all along, and that his soundings were made on this meridian.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The pack ice was moving all the time, so he had no way of knowing where he was without longitudinal observations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Recreation of expedition in 2005===\nBritish explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey in 2005, using replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams. They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours\u2014nearly five hours faster than Peary.<ref>Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/det.htm#pdxm Zero]</ref> Avery writes on his web site that: <blockquote>The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he traveled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole.\"<ref>[http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.html Tom Avery website], retrieved May 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215115623/http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.html |date=February 15, 2009 }}</ref></blockquote>After reaching the Pole, Avery and his team were airlifted off the ice rather than returning by dogsled.\n\nAnalysis of the speeds made by Avery do more to cast doubt on Peary's claim than to confirm it.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} While Peary claimed {{convert|130|nmi|km}} made good in his last five marches, horrific ice conditions meant that Avery managed only {{convert|71|nmi|km}}{{which|date=December 2014}} in his last five marches. Avery never exceeded {{convert|90|nmi|km}} in any five-day stretch, and was losing over {{convert|7|mi|km}} a day at this time to the southerly drift of the ice.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Avery matched Peary's overall 37-day total in part because Peary was held up by open water for five days at the Big Lead. But Peary had a team consisting of 133 dogs and 25 men, meaning he was able to keep his \"polar party\" fresh for the sprint to the Pole. Peary's team was more experienced than Avery's at dog sledding.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Cape York monument.JPG|thumb|alt= Photograph of the Peary monument at Cape York, Greenland | Peary monument at [[Cape York, Greenland|Cape York]]]]\nSeveral United States Navy ships have been named {{USS|Robert E. Peary}}. The [[Peary\u2013MacMillan Arctic Museum]] at Bowdoin College is named for Peary and fellow Arctic explorer [[Donald Baxter MacMillan|Donald B. MacMillan]].

Originally established as a Navy [[Seabee]] training center during World War II, it was repurposed in the 1950s as a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] training facility.  It is commonly called \"The Farm\".\n\nMajor General [[Adolphus Greely]], leader of the ill fated [[Lady Franklin Bay Expedition]] from 1881 to 1884, noted that no Arctic expert questioned that Peary courageously risked his life traveling hundreds of miles from land, and that he reached regions adjacent to the pole. After initial acceptance of Peary's claim, he later came to doubt Peary's having reached 90\u00b0. \n\nIn his book ''Ninety Degrees North'', polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as \"undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration\".{{uncited quote|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Honors ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nMedals\n* American Geographical Society, [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (1896)\n* American Geographical Society, [[Charles P.

He is best known for claiming to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] with his expedition on April 6, 1909.\n\nPeary was born in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], but following his father's death at a young age, was raised in [[Portland, Maine]].  He went to a prominent boarding school called Loomis Chaffe. He attended [[Bowdoin College]], then joined the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] as a draftsman. Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881, as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] (which was never built). Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross [[Greenland]] by [[dogsled]]. [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892|He returned in 1891]] much better prepared, and by reaching [[Independence Fjord]] (in what is now known as [[Peary Land]]) proved conclusively that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study [[Inuit]] survival techniques.\n\nOn his 1898\u20131902 expedition, Peary set a new \"[[Farthest North]]\" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, [[Cape Morris Jesup]]. Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905\u20131906 and in 1908\u20131909. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received a number of awards from [[Learned society|geographical societies]] during his lifetime, and in 1911 received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. He served two terms as president of [[The Explorers Club]] and retired to [[Eagle Island (Casco Bay, Maine)|Eagle Island]].\n\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in contemporary newspapers (along with a competing claim made by [[Frederick Cook]]), but eventually won widespread acceptance. In 1989, British explorer [[Wally Herbert]] concluded Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as {{convert|60|mi|km|0}}. His conclusions have been widely accepted, although disputed by some authorities.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\n[[File:Peary.jpg|thumb|alt= Photographic portrait of Peary |Peary {{circa|1900}}]]\nRobert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], to Charles N. and Mary P.

During that time he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg's Jockey Cap Rock. The 360-degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. After Peary's death, his boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. It was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder and erected to his memory by the Peary family in 1938. A hike of less than a mile leads visitors to the summit and the monument.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/trails/trail/jockey-cap|title=Jockey Cap \u2013 Maine Trail Finder|website=www.mainetrailfinder.com|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings at the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] office in Washington, D.C. He joined the [[United States Navy]] and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned as a civil engineer, with the relative rank of lieutenant.<ref name=NavalHistory/> From 1884 to 1885 he was an assistant engineer on the surveys for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the [[North Pole]].<ref name=Mills510/>\n\nIn April 1886, he wrote a paper for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] proposing two methods for crossing Greenland's ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about {{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} to the east coast. The second, more difficult path, was to start from [[Whale Sound]] at the top of the known portion of [[Baffin Bay]] and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic.<ref name=Mills511/> Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.<ref name=NavalHistory/>\n\n==Initial Arctic expeditions==\nPeary made his first expedition to the [[Arctic]] in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by [[dog sled]], taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a [[whaler]] to Greenland, arriving in [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]] on June 6, 1886.<ref name=Mills510/> Peary wanted to make a solo trek, but a young Danish official named Christian Maigaard convinced him he would die if he went out alone.

By wearing furs to preserve body heat and building igloos, he was able to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march.  Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system\u2014which he called the \"Peary system\"\u2014of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by their body odor (they did not bathe), their flea infestations and their food.

With insufficient food, and  uncertainty whether he could negotiate the ice between himself and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life from the melting ice. On April 20, he was no farther north than 86\u00b030' latitude. For obvious reasons, this latitude was never published by Peary.

This was further exacerbated by Peary's failure to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction (\"[[Magnetic declination|variation]]\") of the compass, for his longitudinal position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either latitudinally or transversely beyond Bartlett Camp.<ref>Herbert, 1989; Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#wpst Contributions]</ref>\n\n====Inconsistent speeds====\n[[File:PearyBartlett.png|thumb|alt= Photograph of Peary and Robert Bartlett | Peary and Robert Bartlett at [[Battle Harbour]] in 1909]]\nThe last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than {{convert|13|mi|km}} marching north. But once the last support party turned back at \"Camp Bartlett\", where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least {{convert|133|nmi|km}} from the pole, Peary's claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup. The recorded speeds quadrupled during the two and a half-day return to Camp Bartlett&nbsp;\u2013 at which point his speed slowed drastically. Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back\u2014which would have assisted his claim of such speed\u2014is contradicted by his companion Henson's account of tortured detours to avoid \"pressure ridges\" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and \"leads\" (open water between those floes).\n\nIn his official report, Peary claimed to have traveled a total of  304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909, (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), {{convert|133|nmi|km}} to the pole, the same distance back, and {{convert|38|nmi|km}} in the vicinity of the pole.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance traveled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of {{convert|304|nmi|km}} more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which\u2014like [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s a month later in 1912\u2014was supported by the sextant, [[theodolite]], and compass observations of several other navigators.\n\n====Review of Peary's diary====\n[[File:Diary of Robert E.

Historian [[Larry Schweikart]] examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), that there were consistent [[pemmican]] and other stains on all pages, and that all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer [[Naomi Uemura]], who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent.<ref>[[Larry Schweikart]], \"Polar Revisionism and the Peary Claim: The Diary of Robert E. Peary,\" ''The Historian'', XLVIII, May 1986.</ref> However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days of April 6 and 7, 1909, and his famous words \"The Pole at Last!\", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.\n\n====1984 and 1989 National Geographic Society studies====\nIn 1984 the National Geographic Society (a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions) commissioned the Arctic explorer [[Wally Herbert]] to write an assessment of Peary's original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary must have falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the Pole.<ref name=\":1\" /> His book, ''The Noose of Laurels'', caused a furor when it was published in 1989. If Peary did not reach the pole in 1909, Herbert himself would claim the record of being the first to reach the pole on foot.<ref name=\"Herbert\">American Polar Society: Sir Wally Herbert].

Peary's original camera (a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak) has not survived. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens\u2014and hence the shadow analysis based on it\u2014must be considered uncertain at best.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The NGS has never released Peary's photos for an independent analysis. Specialists questioned the Society's conclusions.<ref>\"Washington Post\", December 12, 1989; \"Scientific American\", March and June, 1990</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue. Their 1989 report concluded that Peary had indeed reached the Pole.  Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NGS, said, \"I consider this the end of a historic controversy and the confirmation of due justice to a great explorer.\"<ref>Thomas D. Davies, ''Robert E. Peary At The North Pole'', Starpath Publications, 17 Dec 2009; {{ISBN|9780914025207}}</ref>\n\n====Review of depth soundings====\nSupporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed.<ref>[http://www.matthewhenson.com/northpoleproofDEPTH2.htm \"Proof Henson & Peary reached Pole\"], ''Matthew A Henson website''. Retrieved August 11, 2007.</ref> Only the first few of the Peary party's soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}<ref>Peary's expedition possessed 4000 fathoms of sounding line, but he took only 2000 with him over an ocean already established as being deeper in many regions. See, D. Rawlins, ''U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings'', June 1970, p.&nbsp;38, and ''Polar Notes'' (Dartmouth College), volume 10, October, 1970, p.&nbsp;38.</ref> Peary stated (in 1909 Congressional hearings about the expedition) that he made no longitudinal observations during his trip, only latitude observations, yet he maintained he stayed on the \"Columbia meridian\" all along, and that his soundings were made on this meridian.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The pack ice was moving all the time, so he had no way of knowing where he was without longitudinal observations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Recreation of expedition in 2005===\nBritish explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey in 2005, using replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams. They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours\u2014nearly five hours faster than Peary.<ref>Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/det.htm#pdxm Zero]</ref> Avery writes on his web site that: <blockquote>The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he traveled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole.\"<ref>[http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.html Tom Avery website], retrieved May 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215115623/http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.html |date=February 15, 2009 }}</ref></blockquote>After reaching the Pole, Avery and his team were airlifted off the ice rather than returning by dogsled.\n\nAnalysis of the speeds made by Avery do more to cast doubt on Peary's claim than to confirm it.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} While Peary claimed {{convert|130|nmi|km}} made good in his last five marches, horrific ice conditions meant that Avery managed only {{convert|71|nmi|km}}{{which|date=December 2014}} in his last five marches. Avery never exceeded {{convert|90|nmi|km}} in any five-day stretch, and was losing over {{convert|7|mi|km}} a day at this time to the southerly drift of the ice.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Avery matched Peary's overall 37-day total in part because Peary was held up by open water for five days at the Big Lead. But Peary had a team consisting of 133 dogs and 25 men, meaning he was able to keep his \"polar party\" fresh for the sprint to the Pole. Peary's team was more experienced than Avery's at dog sledding.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Cape York monument.JPG|thumb|alt= Photograph of the Peary monument at Cape York, Greenland | Peary monument at [[Cape York, Greenland|Cape York]]]]\nSeveral United States Navy ships have been named {{USS|Robert E.

Originally established as a Navy [[Seabee]] training center during World War II, it was repurposed in the 1950s as a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] training facility.  It is commonly called \"The Farm\".\n\nMajor General [[Adolphus Greely]], leader of the ill fated [[Lady Franklin Bay Expedition]] from 1881 to 1884, noted that no Arctic expert questioned that Peary courageously risked his life traveling hundreds of miles from land, and that he reached regions adjacent to the pole. After initial acceptance of Peary's claim, he later came to doubt Peary's having reached 90\u00b0. \n\nIn his book ''Ninety Degrees North'', polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as \"undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration\".{{uncited quote|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Honors ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nMedals\n* American Geographical Society, [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (1896)\n* American Geographical Society, [[Charles P.

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nEach GPS satellite continuously transmits a radio signal containing the current time and data about its position.  Since the speed of [[radio wave]]s is constant and independent of the satellite speed, the time delay between when the satellite transmits a signal and the receiver receives it is proportional to the distance from the satellite to the receiver.  A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n=== More detailed description ===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges plus time difference between the receiver and GPS satellites multiplied by speed of light, which are called as pseudo-ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]], which is essentially mean [[sea level]]. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a [[moving map display]], or recorded or used by some other system, such as a vehicle guidance system.\n\n=== User-satellite geometry ===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748\u201353, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n=== Receiver in continuous operation ===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-09971-1 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n=== Non-navigation applications ===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nGPS requires four or more satellites to be visible for accurate navigation. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], [[#Timekeeping|make use of]] this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government|access-date=August 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910184805/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2008|url-status=live}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n==== Restrictions on civilian use ====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). It happened the second time at 23:59:42&nbsp;UTC on April 6, 2019. To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern in the future the modernized GPS civil navigation (CNAV) message will use a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n== Communication ==\n{{Main|GPS signals}}\n\nThe navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.\n\n=== Message format ===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}}\n!

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]].

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected). The upper 10&nbsp;MHz intended for use by LightSquared may have some impact on GPS devices.

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

Receivers usually calculate a running estimate of the error in the calculated position. This is done by multiplying the basic resolution of the receiver by quantities called the [[Dilution of precision (navigation)|geometric dilution of position]] (GDOP) factors, calculated from the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility|first=Peter H.|last=Dana|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050823013233/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|archive-date=August 23, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime|title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time|author=Peter H.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n==== Spheres ====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites. The solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of these spheres. Signals from at minimum three satellites are required, and their three spheres would typically intersect at two points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|title=Modern navigation|work=math.nus.edu.sg|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226024421/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the points is the location of the receiver, and the other moves rapidly in successive measurements and would not usually be on Earth's surface.\n\nIn practice, there are many sources of inaccuracy besides clock bias, including random errors as well as the potential for precision loss from subtracting numbers close to each other if the centers of the spheres are relatively close together. This means that the position calculated from three satellites alone is unlikely to be accurate enough. Data from more satellites can help because of the tendency for random errors to cancel out and also by giving a larger spread between the sphere centers. But at the same time, more spheres will not generally intersect at one point. Therefore, a near intersection gets computed, typically via least squares. The more signals available, the better the approximation is likely to be.\n\n==== Hyperboloids ====\nIf the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''i'' and the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''j'' are subtracted, {{nobreak|1=''p<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}, the common receiver clock bias (''b'') cancels out, resulting in a difference of distances {{nobreak|1=''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''d<sub>j</sub>''}}. The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\" /><ref name=\"Fang\" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

This produces large errors in the computed distances to the satellites. Therefore, in practice, the time difference between the receiver clock and the satellite time is defined as an unknown clock bias ''b''. The equations are then solved simultaneously for the receiver position and the clock bias.  The solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space, and signals from at minimum four satellites are needed. In that case each of the equations describes a [[spherical cone]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=GPS Solutions: Closed Forms, Critical and Special Configurations of P4P | doi=10.1007/PL00012897 | volume=5|issue=3 |journal=GPS Solutions|pages=29\u201341 | last1 = Grafarend | first1 = Erik W.|year=2002 }}</ref> with the cusp located at the satellite, and the base a sphere around the satellite.

The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-45785-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |page=59 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704164219/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Precise monitoring ===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===\n{{main|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying)}}\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about {{cvt|0.19|m|||}} for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as {{cvt|2|mm|||}}. This compares to {{cvt|3|m||}} for the C/A code and {{cvt|0.3|m|in|1|}} for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n{{convert|2|mm|spell=In|adj=on|sp=us}} accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, with the values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>&nbsp;.\n\nAlso if <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k}\\ and\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then\n<math>\\ ( a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n}) = a \\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^r(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^s(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^t(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>&nbsp;.\n\nReceiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite&nbsp;1 with that from satellite&nbsp;2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051358/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \\phi_{1,2,1} - \\phi_{1,1,1}</math>\n\nDouble differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051809/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> computes the difference of receiver&nbsp;1's satellite difference from that of receiver&nbsp;2.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n== Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers ==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

Satellite orbital position errors, induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction among others, had to be resolved. A team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970\u20131973, used real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation to do so, reducing systematic and residual errors to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation.<ref>Jury, H L, 1973, Application of Kalman Filter to Real-Time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceeding of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945\u2013952.</ref>\n\nDuring Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about twelve military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a ''Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS)''.

This changed with President [[Bill Clinton]] signing on May 1, 2000 a policy directive to turn off Selective Availability to provide the same accuracy to civilians that was afforded to the military. The directive was proposed by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[William Perry]], in view of the widespread growth of [[differential GPS]] services by private industry to improve civilian accuracy. Moreover, the U.S. military was actively developing technologies to deny GPS service to potential adversaries on a regional basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS & Selective Availability Q&A |publisher=NOAA] |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921115614/http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nSince its deployment, the U.S. has implemented several improvements to the GPS service, including new signals for civil use and increased accuracy and integrity for all users, all the while maintaining compatibility with existing GPS equipment.

The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nEach GPS satellite continuously transmits a radio signal containing the current time and data about its position.  Since the speed of [[radio wave]]s is constant and independent of the satellite speed, the time delay between when the satellite transmits a signal and the receiver receives it is proportional to the distance from the satellite to the receiver.  A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n=== More detailed description ===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]], which is essentially mean [[sea level]]. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a [[moving map display]], or recorded or used by some other system, such as a vehicle guidance system.\n\n=== User-satellite geometry ===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748\u201353, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n=== Receiver in continuous operation ===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-09971-1 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n=== Non-navigation applications ===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nGPS requires four or more satellites to be visible for accurate navigation. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], [[#Timekeeping|make use of]] this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government|access-date=August 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910184805/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2008|url-status=live}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n==== Restrictions on civilian use ====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). It happened the second time at 23:59:42&nbsp;UTC on April 6, 2019. To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern in the future the modernized GPS civil navigation (CNAV) message will use a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n== Communication ==\n{{Main|GPS signals}}\n\nThe navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.\n\n=== Message format ===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}}\n!

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]]. Each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |title=Satellite message format |publisher=Gpsinformation.net |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101021138/http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |archive-date=November 1, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe first subframe of each frame encodes the week number and the time within the week,<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter H.

Thus, to obtain an accurate satellite location from this transmitted message, the receiver must demodulate the message from each satellite it includes in its solution for 18 to 30 seconds. To collect all transmitted almanacs, the receiver must demodulate the message for 732 to 750 seconds or 12 1/2 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |title=Interface Specification IS-GPS-200, Revision D: Navstar GPS Space Segment/Navigation User Interfaces |publisher=Navstar GPS Joint Program Office |page=103 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908003700/http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAll satellites broadcast at the same frequencies, encoding signals using unique [[code division multiple access]] (CDMA) so receivers can distinguish individual satellites from each other.

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected). The upper 10&nbsp;MHz intended for use by LightSquared may have some impact on GPS devices. There is some concern that this may seriously degrade the GPS signal for many consumer uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029 |title=Federal Communications Commission Presented Evidence of GPS Signal Interference |publisher=GPS World |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011082258/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029 |archivedate=October 11, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveourgps.org/studies-reports.aspx|title=Coalition to Save Our GPS|publisher=Saveourgps.org|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030072958/http://saveourgps.org/studies-reports.aspx|archivedate=October 30, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Aviation Week]]'' magazine reports that the latest testing (June 2011) confirms \"significant jamming\" of GPS by LightSquared's system.<ref name=\"aviationweek1\">{{cite magazine|title=LightSquared Tests Confirm GPS Jamming |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awx/2011/06/09/awx_06_09_2011_p0-334122.xml&headline=LightSquared%20Tests%20Confirm%20GPS%20Jamming&channel=busav |magazine=Aviation Week |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045607/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news%2Fawx%2F2011%2F06%2F09%2Fawx_06_09_2011_p0-334122.xml&headline=LightSquared%20Tests%20Confirm%20GPS%20Jamming&channel=busav |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== Demodulation and decoding ===\n<!-- Demodulation is done with carrier frequency; decoding is done with Gold Code. -->\n\n[[File:gps ca gold.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Demodulating and decoding GPS satellite signals|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals using the Coarse<!-- \"Coarse\" is correct, as in \"not precision\"-->/Acquisition [[Gold code]].]]\n\nBecause all of the satellite signals are modulated onto the same L1 carrier frequency, the signals must be separated after demodulation.

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

Receivers usually calculate a running estimate of the error in the calculated position. This is done by multiplying the basic resolution of the receiver by quantities called the [[Dilution of precision (navigation)|geometric dilution of position]] (GDOP) factors, calculated from the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility|first=Peter H.|last=Dana|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050823013233/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|archive-date=August 23, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime|title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time|author=Peter H.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n==== Spheres ====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites. The solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of these spheres. Signals from at minimum three satellites are required, and their three spheres would typically intersect at two points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|title=Modern navigation|work=math.nus.edu.sg|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226024421/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the points is the location of the receiver, and the other moves rapidly in successive measurements and would not usually be on Earth's surface.\n\nIn practice, there are many sources of inaccuracy besides clock bias, including random errors as well as the potential for precision loss from subtracting numbers close to each other if the centers of the spheres are relatively close together. This means that the position calculated from three satellites alone is unlikely to be accurate enough. Data from more satellites can help because of the tendency for random errors to cancel out and also by giving a larger spread between the sphere centers. But at the same time, more spheres will not generally intersect at one point. Therefore, a near intersection gets computed, typically via least squares. The more signals available, the better the approximation is likely to be.\n\n==== Hyperboloids ====\nIf the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''i'' and the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''j'' are subtracted, {{nobreak|1=''p<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}, the common receiver clock bias (''b'') cancels out, resulting in a difference of distances {{nobreak|1=''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''d<sub>j</sub>''}}. The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\" /><ref name=\"Fang\" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

This produces large errors in the computed distances to the satellites. Therefore, in practice, the time difference between the receiver clock and the satellite time is defined as an unknown clock bias ''b''. The equations are then solved simultaneously for the receiver position and the clock bias.  The solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space, and signals from at minimum four satellites are needed. In that case each of the equations describes a [[spherical cone]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=GPS Solutions: Closed Forms, Critical and Special Configurations of P4P | doi=10.1007/PL00012897 | volume=5|issue=3 |journal=GPS Solutions|pages=29\u201341 | last1 = Grafarend | first1 = Erik W.|year=2002 }}</ref> with the cusp located at the satellite, and the base a sphere around the satellite.

Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information (such as clock drift, ephemera, or [[ionospheric delay]]), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information.\n\nExamples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS), [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]]. The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-45785-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |page=59 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704164219/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Precise monitoring ===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===\n{{main|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying)}}\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about {{cvt|0.19|m|||}} for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as {{cvt|2|mm|||}}. This compares to {{cvt|3|m||}} for the C/A code and {{cvt|0.3|m|in|1|}} for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n{{convert|2|mm|spell=In|adj=on|sp=us}} accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time.

This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n== Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers ==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

{"title_page": "Bering Sea Arbitration", "text_new": "The '''Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893''' arose out of a [[fishery]] dispute between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[United States]] in the 1880s. The [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the [[Dominion of Canada]]), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.\n\nBy [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in \"the waters adjacent thereto\" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words \"waters adjacent\" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}</ref> As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.<ref name=nie/>\n\n==British involvement and escalation==\nIn the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']], 60 miles from land.<ref>[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.</ref> They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]]. America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of Canada, had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.\n\nThe United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.\n\nThe negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.\n\n==Arbitration==\nThere followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific\npoints, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.\n\nOn February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.\n\n===Terms of reference and arbitrators===\nThe points submitted were\n#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? \n#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? \n#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase \"Pacific Ocean\", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? \n#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? \n#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?\n\nIn the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.\n\nThe United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and Mr [[John T. Morgan]], a member of the Senate. The British arbitrators were [[Lord Hannen]] and [[Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]]. The neutral arbitrators were the Baron de Courcel, the [[Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta|Marquis Visconti-Venosta]], and Mr. [[Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram]], appointed respectively by the president of the French Republic, the king of Italy, and the king of Norway and Sweden. The sittings of the tribunal began in February 1893 and ended in August.  [[Henry Williams Blodgett]] acted as U.S. counsel before the tribunal.\n\n===Main arguments===\nWhen the evidence was before the tribunal, it was plain that the United States had a very weak case with regard to the claim of exclusive jurisdiction in the Bering Sea (the first claim), and it was not strongly pressed by the counsel of the United States.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}</ref> The real question, therefore, and the one upon which the chief argument was directed, was the second of the two claims put forward on behalf of the United States, the right of property in the seals and the right of protecting them beyond the three-mile limit.\n\nIt was suggested that the seals had some of the characteristics of the domestic animals, and could therefore be the subject of something in the nature of a right of property. They were so far amenable to human control that it was possible to take their increase without destroying the stock. Sealing upon land was legitimate sealing; the United States being the owners of the land, the industry was a trust vested in them for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand, pelagic sealing, being a method of promiscuous slaughter, was illegitimate; it was ''contra bonos mores'' and analogous to piracy. Consequently, the United States claimed a right to restrain such practices, both as proprietors of the seals and as proprietors and trustees of the legitimate industry.\n\nSuch a right to restrain was a novelty hitherto unrecognized by any system of law. [[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon \"the principles of right,\" that \"by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied.\" The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nSince the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.<ref name=nie/>\n\nThese regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve. The largest catch in the history of pelagic sealing, that of 1894, was made in the first season of the operation of these very regulations designed to so limit and restrict pelagic sealing as to protect and preserve the herd.<ref name=ea>{{Americana |last=Clark |first=George Archibald |wstitle=Seals and Sealing|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nA joint commission of scientists from Great Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.  However further joint tribunals did not enact new legal restrictions, and then Japan also embarked upon pelagic sealing.<ref name=ea/> Finally, the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911]] severely curtailed the sealing industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cod Wars]]\n*[[1993 Cherbourg incident]]\n*[[Turbot War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=July 2014}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Bering Sea Arbitration |volume=3 |pages=776-777 |first=Montague Hughes |last=Crackanthorpe}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''], E.O.S.

As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}</ref> As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.<ref name=nie/>\n\n==British involvement and escalation==\nIn the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']], 60 miles from land.<ref>[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.</ref> They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]]. America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of Canada, had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.\n\nThe United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.\n\nThe negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.\n\n==Arbitration==\nThere followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific\npoints, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.\n\nOn February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.\n\n===Terms of reference and arbitrators===\nThe points submitted were\n#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? \n#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? \n#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase \"Pacific Ocean\", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? \n#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? \n#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?\n\nIn the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.\n\nThe United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and Mr [[John T. Morgan]], a member of the Senate. The British arbitrators were [[Lord Hannen]] and [[Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]]. The neutral arbitrators were the Baron de Courcel, the [[Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta|Marquis Visconti-Venosta]], and Mr. [[Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram]], appointed respectively by the president of the French Republic, the king of Italy, and the king of Norway and Sweden. The sittings of the tribunal began in February 1893 and ended in August.  [[Henry Williams Blodgett]] acted as U.S. counsel before the tribunal.\n\n===Main arguments===\nWhen the evidence was before the tribunal, it was plain that the United States had a very weak case with regard to the claim of exclusive jurisdiction in the Bering Sea (the first claim), and it was not strongly pressed by the counsel of the United States.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}</ref> The real question, therefore, and the one upon which the chief argument was directed, was the second of the two claims put forward on behalf of the United States, the right of property in the seals and the right of protecting them beyond the three-mile limit.\n\nIt was suggested that the seals had some of the characteristics of the domestic animals, and could therefore be the subject of something in the nature of a right of property. They were so far amenable to human control that it was possible to take their increase without destroying the stock. Sealing upon land was legitimate sealing; the United States being the owners of the land, the industry was a trust vested in them for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand, pelagic sealing, being a method of promiscuous slaughter, was illegitimate; it was ''contra bonos mores'' and analogous to piracy. Consequently, the United States claimed a right to restrain such practices, both as proprietors of the seals and as proprietors and trustees of the legitimate industry.\n\nSuch a right to restrain was a novelty hitherto unrecognized by any system of law. [[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon \"the principles of right,\" that \"by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied.\" The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nSince the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.<ref name=nie/>\n\nThese regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve. The largest catch in the history of pelagic sealing, that of 1894, was made in the first season of the operation of these very regulations designed to so limit and restrict pelagic sealing as to protect and preserve the herd.<ref name=ea>{{Americana |last=Clark |first=George Archibald |wstitle=Seals and Sealing|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nA joint commission of scientists from Great Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.  However further joint tribunals did not enact new legal restrictions, and then Japan also embarked upon pelagic sealing.<ref name=ea/> Finally, the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911]] severely curtailed the sealing industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cod Wars]]\n*[[1993 Cherbourg incident]]\n*[[Turbot War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=July 2014}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Bering Sea Arbitration |volume=3 |pages=776-777 |first=Montague Hughes |last=Crackanthorpe}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''], E.O.S.
