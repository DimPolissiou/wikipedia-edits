A recording became available to the public for the first time in 1998 when [[Sony Music Entertainment]] released the compact disc. One month after the Winterland concert, [[Owsley Stanley]] recorded them at the Carousel Ballroom, released in 2012 as ''[[Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968]]''.\n\nOn July 31, 1968, Joplin made her first nationwide television appearance when the band performed on ''This Morning'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime 90-minute variety show hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. Shortly thereafter, network employees [[wiping|wiped]] the videotape, though the audio survives. (In 1969 and 1970, Joplin made three appearances on Cavett's prime-time program. Video was preserved and excerpts have been included in most documentaries about Joplin. Audio of her 1968 appearance has not been used since then.)\n\nSometime in 1968, the band's billing was changed to \"Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company,\"<ref name=\"dalton\"/> and the media coverage given to Joplin generated resentment within the band.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> The other members of Big Brother thought that Joplin was on a \"star trip\", while others were telling Joplin that Big Brother was a terrible band and that she ought to dump them.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> ''Time'' magazine called Joplin \"probably the most powerful singer to emerge from the white rock movement\", and [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]] wrote for the May 1968 issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine that Joplin was \"the most staggering leading woman in rock ... she slinks like tar, scowls like war ... clutching the knees of a final stanza, begging it not to leave ... Janis Joplin can sing the chic off any listener.\"<ref name=\"jacobson\"/>\n\nFor her first major studio recording, Joplin played a major role in the arrangement and production of the songs that would comprise Big Brother and the Holding Company's second album, ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''. During the recording sessions, produced by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]], Joplin was said to be the first person to enter the studio and the last person to leave. Footage of Joplin and the band in the studio shows Joplin in great form and taking charge during the recording for \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\". The album featured a cover design by [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]].\n\n[[File:Big_Brother_in_Alexandria_Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|Review of Big Brother and the Holding Company concert in Alexandria, Virginia by opera buff John Segraves]] Although ''Cheap Thrills'' sounded as if it consisted of concert recordings, like on \"Combination of the Two\" and \"I Need a Man to Love\", only \"Ball and Chain\" was actually recorded in front of a paying audience; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings.<ref name=\"scars\"/> The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a drinking glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song \"Turtle Blues\".

On September 14, 1968, culminating a three-night engagement together at Fillmore West, fans thronged to a concert that [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] publicized as the last official concert of Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company.

The band was influenced by the [[Stax Records|Stax-Volt]] [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by [[Otis Redding]] and [[the Bar-Kays]].<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> The Stax-Volt R&B sound was typified by the use of horns and had a funky, pop-oriented sound in contrast to many of the psychedelic/hard rock bands of the period.\n\nBy early 1969, Joplin was allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day (equivalent to $1300 in 2016 dollars)<ref name=\"caserta\"/> although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]''. Gabriel Mekler, who produced ''Kozmic Blues'', told publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman after Joplin's death that she had lived in his Los Angeles house during the June 1969 recording sessions at his insistence so he could keep her away from drugs and her drug-using friends.<ref name=\"buried\"/>\n\nJoplin's appearances with the Kozmic Blues Band in Europe were released in cinemas, in multiple documentaries. ''[[Janis (film)|Janis]]'', which was reviewed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' on March 21, 1975,<ref>{{cite news |title='Janis': Purified Joplin |last=Zito |first=Tom |date=March 21, 1975 |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=B11}}</ref> shows Joplin arriving in [[Frankfurt]] by plane and waiting inside a bus next to the Frankfurt venue, while an American female fan who is visiting Germany expresses enthusiasm to the camera (no security was used in Frankfurt, so by the end of the concert, the stage was so packed with people the band members could not see each other). ''Janis'' also includes interviews with Joplin in Stockholm and from her visit to [[London]], for her gig at [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The London interview was dubbed with a voiceover in the German language for broadcast on German television. John Byrne Cooke, road manager for Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band, wrote a book published in 2014 in which he revealed the illegal status of Joplin's ongoing use of narcotics.<ref name=\"on the road\">{{Cite book |title=On the Road With Janis Joplin |first=John Byrne |last=Cooke |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-425-27411-8 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>On Kozmic Blues' tour of Europe, Janis was terrified at every border crossing and customs inspection, knowing that the works and the smack she had stashed on her person could send her directly to jail on a tough rap to beat in foreign courts.

However, the album's recording quality and engineering, as well as the musicianship (including three performances by former [[Bob Dylan]]/[[Paul Butterfield]]/[[Electric Flag]] guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]]), were considered superior to her previous releases, and some music critics argued that the band was working in a much more constructive way to support Joplin's sensational vocal talents. Joplin wanted a horn section similar to that featured by the [[Chicago (band)|Chicago Transit Authority]]; her voice had the dynamic qualities and range not to be overpowered by the brighter horn sound.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}}\n\nSome music critics, however, including [[Ralph J.

Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling coarsely at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also has something to say in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love, and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo ... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked into the lobby and watched customers (sic) arrive.

Joplin informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. On Saturday afternoon, when she and the band were flown by helicopter with the pregnant [[Joan Baez]] and Baez's mother from a nearby motel to the festival site and Joplin saw the enormous crowd, she instantly became extremely nervous and giddy. Upon landing and getting off the helicopter, Joplin was approached by reporters asking her questions. She referred them to her friend and sometime lover Peggy Caserta as she was too excited to speak. Initially, Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin shot heroin and drank alcohol<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"caserta\"/> with Caserta, and by the time of reaching the stage, Joplin was \"[[wikt:three sheets to the wind|three sheets to the wind]]\".<ref name=\"scars\"/> During her performance, Joplin's voice became slightly hoarse and wheezy, and she struggled to dance.\n\nJoplin pulled through, however, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang \"Ball and Chain\". [[Pete Townshend]], who performed with [[the Who]] later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: \"She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Townshend |first=Pete |title=Who I am: a memoir |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2012 |pages=179}}</ref>\n\nJanis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00&nbsp;a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform.<ref name=\"Crosby 1988 161\u2013162\">{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=David |title=Long Time Gone |publisher=Doubleday|year=1988 |pages=161\u2013162}}</ref> This information was published by [[David Crosby]] in 1988.<ref name=\"Crosby 1988 161\u2013162\"/> Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in [[Joe Cocker]]'s van and witnessed [[list of performances and events at Woodstock Festival#Sunday, August 17 to Monday, August 18|Hendrix's close-of-show performance]], according to Baez's memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With'' (1989).<ref>{{cite book |last=Baez |first=Joan |title=And a Voice to Sing With |publisher=Summit Books |year=1989 |pages=163\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nStill photographs in color show Joplin backstage with [[Grace Slick]] the day after Joplin's performance, wherein Joplin appears to be very happy. Joplin was ultimately unhappy with her performance, however, and blamed Caserta. Her singing was not included (by her own insistence) in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'', although the 25th anniversary director's cut of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' includes her performance of \"[[Work Me, Lord]]\". The documentary film of the festival that was released to theaters in 1970 includes, on the left side of a [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], 37 seconds of footage of Joplin and Caserta walking toward Joplin's dressing room tent.<ref>{{YouTube|id=kvLno-hy_jE#t=1m44s |title=Footage of Joplin and Caserta begins at 1:44 and ends at 2:21}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Woodstock, Joplin also had problems at [[Madison Square Garden]], in 1969. Biographer Myra Friedman said she witnessed a duet Joplin sang with [[Tina Turner]] during [[the Rolling Stones]] concert at the Garden on [[Thanksgiving Day]]. Friedman said Joplin was \"so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania.\"<ref name=\"buried\"/> During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot.<ref name=\"buried\"/> For part of this concert she was joined onstage by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Paul Butterfield]].\n\nJoplin told rock journalist David Dalton that Garden audiences watched and listened to \"every note [she sang] with 'Is she gonna make it?' in their eyes.\"<ref name=\"dalton\"/> In her interview with Dalton she added that she felt most comfortable performing at small, cheap venues in San Francisco that were associated with the counterculture.\n\nAt the time of this June 1970 interview, she had already performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. Sam Andrew, the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"dalton\">{{Cite book |title=Piece Of My Heart |first=David |last=Dalton |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |date=August 21, 1991 |isbn=978-0-306-80446-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Janis Joplin 1970.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Joplin in 1970]]\nIn February 1970, Joplin traveled to [[Brazil]], where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites, who had designed the singer's stage costumes from 1967 to 1969.\n\nIn Brazil, Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. A Joplin biography written by her sister Laura said, \"David was an upper-middle-class Cincinnati kid who had studied communications at Notre Dame. ... [and] had joined the Peace Corps after college and worked in a small village in Turkey. ... He tried law school, but when he met Janis he was taking time off.\"<ref name=\"Joplin, Laura\"/>\n\n[[File:Janis studio.jpg|thumb|right|Joplin in 1970]]Niehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at [[Rio Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=\"dalton\"/> Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites' snapshots they \"look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: \"I'm going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don't have to be on stage twelve months a year. I've decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn added in 1992, \"Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about David was that he wasn't into drugs.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nWhen Joplin returned to the U.S., she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in [[Larkspur, California]]. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin's refusal to take some time off and travel the world with him.<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"Garvin, Glenn\" />\n\nAround this time, she formed her new band, known for a short time as Main Squeeze, then renamed the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> The band comprised mostly young Canadian musicians previously associated with [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie band than she did with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, \"It's ''my'' band. Finally it's ''my'' band!\"<ref name=\"scars\"/> In May 1970, after performing under the name Main Squeeze at a Hell's Angels event, the renamed Full Tilt Boogie Band began a nationwide tour. Joplin became very happy with her new group, which eventually received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics.<ref name=\"scars\"/>\n\n[[File:Janis San Rafael.jpg|thumb|left|poster for May 21, 1970 event that featured both Big Brother and Joplin's new band, then billed as Main Squeeze]] Prior to beginning a summer tour with Full Tilt Boogie, she performed in a reunion with Big Brother at the [[Fillmore West]], in San Francisco, on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included in an in-concert album released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at [[Winterland]], where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> She performed with the band, billed as Main Squeeze, at a party for the [[Hells Angels]] at a venue in [[San Rafael, California]] on May 21, 1970, according to a web site maintained by Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew.<ref name=\"samandrew\">{{cite web |url=http://samandrew.com/big-brother-history-part-six-1969-to-1972/ |title=Big Brother history, part six, 1969 to 1972 |first=Sam |last=Andrew |date=May 9, 2012 |website=samandrew.com |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> Andrew's web site quotes him as saying, \"This will be the first time that Janis' old band and her new band will be at the same venue, so everyone is a little on edge.\"<ref name=\"samandrew\"/>\n\nAccording to Joplin's biographer Ellis Amburn, Big Brother with its lead singer Nick Gravenites was the opening act at the party that was attended by 2,300 people.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of 240 dollars to perform.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Gravenites and Sam Andrew (who had resumed playing guitar with Big Brother) differed in their opinions of her performance and how substance abuse affected it.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Gravenites described her singing as \"stupendous,\" according to Amburn.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn quoted Andrew twenty years later: \"She was visibly deteriorating and she looked bloated. She was like a parody of what she was at her best. I put it down to her drinking too much and I felt a tinge of fear for her well-being. Her singing was real flabby, no edge at all.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nShortly thereafter, Joplin began wearing multi-coloured feather boas in her hair. (She had not worn them at the May 21 Hell's Angels party / concert in San Rafael).<ref name=\"samandrew\"/> By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nPreparing to board the all-star ''[[Festival Express]]'' train tour through Canada, members of Full Tilt Boogie passed through customs at what was then called Toronto International Airport. Road manager John Byrne Cooke recalled the scene in his 2014 book.<ref name=\"on the road\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The inspecting officers pass [band members except Joplin] through with a few perfunctory pokes in their bags while a diminutive officer with a solemn, round face begins a thorough search of Janis's luggage. Unaccountably, she seems to welcome his attention.\n\nHer suitcase looks as if she packed by throwing clothes at it from across the room. Her hippie handbag is overflowing with odds and ends scooped up at the last minute during the bleary rush of our early-morning departure [from a hotel in [[Schenectady, New York]] where they performed the previous night].\n\n\"Hey, man,\" Janis says to the small customs officer. \"Don't you want to look in here? That's my toilet kit, man, there might be some pills in there.\"\n\nWhat the hell is going on? I try to signal Janis to quit goading the inspector so we can get out of here before we all keel over from exhaustion. I'm afraid to do it too openly for fear of arousing more suspicion. Janis takes no notice.\n\nLike a sheep being led to the dipping trough, the officer follows Janis's direction. He heads straight for the toilet kit and pulls out a bag of powder. My heart skips a beat.\n\n\"What is this, 'ma'mselle'?\"\n\nJanis can scarcely contain herself. \"That's douche powder, honey!\" she proclaims, loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\n\"Ah, 'oui, oui, ma'mselle'.\" The little French-Canadian inspector almost chokes with embarrassment. His complexion explores the scarlet end of the spectrum while he moves on quickly to something safer. But he keeps searching. ...\n\nThe border watchdogs can search all day and never find a thing. Janis is clean. She is as respectable as a symphony conductor. She is proud and she is celebrating.\n\nThe boys [Full Tilt Boogie musicians] amuse themselves as best they can. [Pianist] Richard Bell passes the time with a yo-yo. Nothing fancy, just up and down, up and down, grinning as he watches Janis urge the inspector on. ...\n\nJanis prolongs the game until even the obtuse little customs inspector finally realizes that no one who has anything to hide would behave like this.<ref name=\"on the road\"/></blockquote>\n\nFrom June 28 to July 4, 1970, during the Festival Express tour, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie performed alongside [[Buddy Guy]], [[the Band]], [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Delaney & Bonnie]], [[Eric Andersen]], and [[Ian & Sylvia]].<ref name=\"amburn\"/> They played concerts in [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"dalton\"/> Joplin jammed with the other performers on the train, and her performances on this tour are considered to be among her greatest.\n\nJoplin headlined the festival on all three nights. At the last stop in Calgary, she took to the stage with [[Jerry Garcia]] while her band was tuning up. Film footage shows her telling the audience how great the tour was and she and Garcia presenting the organizers with a case of [[tequila]]. She then burst into a two-hour set, starting with \"[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]\". Throughout this performance, Joplin engaged in several banters about her love life. In one, she reminisced about living in a San Francisco apartment and competing with a female neighbor in flirting with men on the street. She finished the Calgary concert with long versions of \"Get It While You Can\" and \"Ball and Chain\".\n\nFootage of her performance of \"Tell Mama\" in Calgary became an [[MTV]] video in the early 1980s, and the audio from the same film footage was included on the ''[[Farewell Song]]'' (1982) album. The audio of other ''Festival Express'' performances was included on Joplin's ''In Concert'' (1972) album. Video of the performances was also included on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' DVD.\n\nThese performances of entire songs during the ''Festival Express'' concerts in Toronto and Calgary can be purchased, although other songs remain in vaults and have yet to be released.\n\nIn the \"Tell Mama\" video shown on MTV in the 1980s, Joplin wore a psychedelically colored, loose-fitting costume and feathers in her hair. This was her standard stage costume in the spring and summer of 1970. She chose the new costumes after her friend and designer, Linda Gravenites (whom Joplin had praised in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''{{'}}s profile of her in its May 1968 edition), cut ties with Joplin shortly after their return from Brazil, due largely to Joplin's continued use of heroin.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nDuring the ''Festival Express'' tour, Joplin was accompanied by ''Rolling Stone'' writer David Dalton, who later wrote several articles and two books on Joplin. She told Dalton:\n\n{{quote|I'm a victim of my own insides. There was a time when I wanted to know everything ... It used to make me very unhappy, all that feeling. I just didn't know what to do with it. But now I've learned to make that feeling work ''for'' me. I'm full of emotion and I want a release, and if you're on stage and if it's really working and you've got the audience with you, it's a ''oneness'' you feel.<ref name=\"dalton\"/>}}\n\nAmong Joplin's last public appearances were two broadcasts of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. In her June 25, 1970 appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high school class reunion. When asked if she had been popular in school, she admitted that when in high school, her schoolmates \"laughed me out of class, out of town and out of the state\"<ref name=\"cavett-janisinterview\">{{Cite episode |title=Dick Cavett TV Interview (1970) |series=[[The Dick Cavett Show]] |airdate=1970-08-03}}</ref> (during the year she had spent at the University of Texas at Austin, Joplin had been voted \"Ugliest Man on Campus\" by frat boys).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/joplin.htm |title=Janis Joplin: A Cry Cutting Through Time |first=Paul |last=Hendrickson |date=May 5, 1998 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> In the subsequent ''Cavett Show'' broadcast, on August 3, 1970, and featuring [[Gloria Swanson]], Joplin discussed her upcoming performance at the [[Festival for Peace]] to be held at [[Shea Stadium]] in Queens, New York, three days later.\n\nOn August 7, 1970, a tombstone\u2014jointly paid for by Joplin and Juanita Green, who as a child had done housework for [[Bessie Smith]]\u2014was erected at Smith's previously unmarked grave.

It was there that she first performed \"[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]\", a song (partially inspired by a [[Michael McClure]] poem) that she had written that day in the bar next door to the Capitol Theatre with fellow musician and friend [[Bob Neuwirth]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Albertson |first=Chris |date=1975 |title=Bessie Smith: Empress of the Blues |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |page=277 |isbn=978-0-0287-0030-4}}</ref> According to Myra Friedman's account,<ref name=\"buried\"/> Joplin performed two shows at the Capitol Theatre, the first of which was attended by actors [[Geraldine Page]] and her husband [[Rip Torn]],<ref name=\"buried\"/> and it was during subsequent free time at a \"gin mill\" very close to this concert venue that Joplin and Neuwirth penned the lyrics to the song<ref name=\"buried\"/> and she performed it at the second show.<ref name=\"buried\"/>\n\nJoplin's last public performance with the Full Tilt Boogie Band took place on August 12, 1970, at the [[Harvard Stadium]] in Boston.

Rothchild]], best known for his lengthy relationship with [[The Doors]]. Although Joplin died before all the tracks were fully completed, there was enough usable material to compile an LP.\n\nThe posthumous ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'' (1971) became the biggest-selling album of her career<ref name=\"craig\"/> and featured her biggest hit single, a cover of [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Fred Foster]]'s \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" (Kristofferson had previously been Joplin's lover in the spring of 1970).<ref>Anthony DeCurtis, ''Rolling Stone'', September 30, 1999</ref> The opening track, \"Move Over\", was written by Joplin, reflecting the way that she felt men treated women in relationships. Also included was the social commentary of \"Mercedes Benz\", presented in an ''[[a cappella]]'' arrangement; the track on the album features the first and only take that Joplin recorded. A cover of [[Nick Gravenites]]'s \"Buried Alive in the Blues\", to which Joplin had been scheduled to add her vocals on the day she was found dead, was included as an instrumental.\n\n[[File:Janis Joplin performing.jpg|thumb|upright|Janis Joplin performing at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island in July 1968<ref name=\"buried\"/>]]\nJoplin checked into the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood on August 24, 1970,<ref>''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]'' October 5, 1970, front page.</ref> near [[Sunset Sound Recorders]],<ref name=\"amburn\"/> where she began rehearsing and recording her album.

In a version of Friedman's book that she wrote twenty years later, she said about the hotel's claim of a phone call to City Hall, \"This may have been untrue.\"]<ref name=\"buried\"/>\n\nBy the time they returned to the studio, it was jammed. Nick Gravenites was there. So was song writer Bobby Womack. Bennett Glotzer [Albert Grossman's partner in their New York-based talent management company] was around.

This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [Joplin's] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal more than most people comprehended. Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. She was, as [the psychiatric social worker she saw regularly in Beaumont, Texas in 1965 and 1966] Mr. [Bernard] Giarritano put it [in an interview with Friedman], \"diffused\" -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. That had as much to do with her original use of drugs [before she first met Giarritano] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women.

Clarifying this further, the ''[[Consumers Union]] Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs'' states that the term \"overdose\" is most frequently erroneous. The report cites information that those sudden deaths following an injection of heroin are actually the result of an [[adulteration]] of the product with various substances or of other mysterious factors: what is called a \"[[synergy#Drug synergy|synergistic reaction]]\" to a combination of drugs, for example, or of other [[toxicity|toxic factor]]s.

According to Ellis Amburn, in 1973 a \"carful of dope dealers\" visited a Los Angeles lesbian bar Caserta had been frequenting since Joplin was alive.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn quoted Caserta's friend Kim Chappell, who was in the alley behind the bar: \"I was stabbed because, when Peggy's book came out, her dealer, the same one who'd given Janis her last fix, didn't like it that he was referred to and was out to get Peggy.

The other was the time that we opened up for Janis at the San Jose Fairgrounds, around 1970.\n\nIt was a hot summer day, and things didn't start off well because the entire show was running late. That meant our set was running over. We were onstage and going over pretty well, when I turned and saw a furious Janis Joplin on the side of the stage, yelling at us. She was screaming something like, \"What the fuck are you assholes doing? Get the hell off of my stage.\" Actually, she might have even been a little cruder than that \u2014 it was hard to hear.\n\nBut then Janis got up on that stage with her band, and this woman who was screaming at me only moments before suddenly became my new hero. Janis Joplin was not what anyone would call a great beauty, but she became beautiful because she made such a powerful and deep emotional connection with the audience. I didn't mind the feathers and the bell-bottom pants either. Janis didn't dress like anyone else, and she definitely didn't sing like anyone else.\n\nJanis put herself out there completely, and her voice was not only strong and soulful, it was painfully and beautifully real. She sang in the great tradition of the rhythm & blues singers that were her heroes, but she brought her own dangerous, sexy rock & roll edge to every single song. She really gave you a piece of her heart. And that inspired me to find my own voice and my own style.<ref>CD Liner Notes - Big Brother and the Holding Company's (Joplin's band) Live at Winterland '68</ref>}}\n\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] said about Joplin: \"She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie.\" <ref name=\"majorinfluence\">{{Cite news |first=Robert |last=Hilburn |title=Her colors don't run |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/09/entertainment/ca-hilburn9 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 9, 2003 |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}</ref> In a tribute performance on her [[Try This Tour]], Pink called Joplin \"a woman who inspired me when everyone else ... didn't!\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/mar/22/popandrock1 |title=Pink, Birmingham NEC |first=Dave |last=Simpson |date=March 22, 2004 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\nJanis Joplin recorded four albums in her four-year career.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/janis-joplin-why-she-still-has-a-piece-of-our-heart/ |title=Janis Joplin: why she still has a piece of our heart |first=Alice |last=Vincent |date=January 19, 2016 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> The first two albums were recorded with and credited to [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]; the later two were recorded with different backing bands and released as solo albums.<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books|gA2LAwAAQBAJ |page=PA129|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |page=129 |title=The Emergence of Rock and Roll |first=Mitchell K. |last=Hall |publisher=Routledge |date=May 9, 2014 |isbn=978-1-1350-5358-1}}</ref> Previously unreleased studio and live material, including early performances as well as Joplin's greatest hits, have been released on several posthumous compilations.<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books|Wvu4TKTboYUC |page=PA112|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |page=112 |title=Blues Music in the Sixties |first=Ulrich |last=Adelt |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-8135-4750-3}}</ref>\n\n* ''[[Big Brother & the Holding Company (album)|Big Brother and the Holding Company]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'' (1971)\n\nSome of Joplin's live concerts with Big Brother were professionally recorded and have been released on albums like ''[[Live at Winterland '68]]'' and ''[[Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968]]''.\n\n===Full discography===\n====Big Brother and the Holding Company====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One month after the Winterland concert, [[Owsley Stanley]] recorded them at the Carousel Ballroom, released in 2012 as ''[[Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968]]''.\n\nOn July 31, 1968, Joplin made her first nationwide television appearance when the band performed on ''This Morning'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime 90-minute variety show hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. Shortly thereafter, network employees [[wiping|wiped]] the videotape, though the audio survives. (In 1969 and 1970, Joplin made three appearances on Cavett's prime-time program. Video was preserved and excerpts have been included in most documentaries about Joplin. Audio of her 1968 appearance has not been used since then.)\n\nSometime in 1968, the band's billing was changed to \"Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company,\"<ref name=\"dalton\"/> and the media coverage given to Joplin generated resentment within the band.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> The other members of Big Brother thought that Joplin was on a \"star trip\", while others were telling Joplin that Big Brother was a terrible band and that she ought to dump them.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> ''Time'' magazine called Joplin \"probably the most powerful singer to emerge from the white rock movement\", and [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]] wrote for the May 1968 issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine that Joplin was \"the most staggering leading woman in rock ... she slinks like tar, scowls like war ... clutching the knees of a final stanza, begging it not to leave ... Janis Joplin can sing the chic off any listener.\"<ref name=\"jacobson\"/>\n\nFor her first major studio recording, Joplin played a major role in the arrangement and production of the songs that would comprise Big Brother and the Holding Company's second album, ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''. During the recording sessions, produced by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]], Joplin was said to be the first person to enter the studio and the last person to leave. Footage of Joplin and the band in the studio shows Joplin in great form and taking charge during the recording for \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\". The album featured a cover design by [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]].\n\n[[File:Big_Brother_in_Alexandria_Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|Review of Big Brother and the Holding Company concert in Alexandria, Virginia by opera buff John Segraves]] Although ''Cheap Thrills'' sounded as if it consisted of concert recordings, like on \"Combination of the Two\" and \"I Need a Man to Love\", only \"Ball and Chain\" was actually recorded in front of a paying audience; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings.<ref name=\"scars\"/> The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a drinking glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song \"Turtle Blues\". ''Cheap Thrills'' produced very popular hits with \"[[Piece of My Heart]]\" and \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\".

After returning to San Francisco for two hometown shows at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] Festival on August 31 and September 1, Joplin announced that she would be leaving Big Brother. On September 14, 1968, culminating a three-night engagement together at Fillmore West, fans thronged to a concert that [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] publicized as the last official concert of Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company. The opening acts on this night were [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] (then still called Chicago Transit Authority) and [[Santana (band)|Santana]].\n\nDespite Graham's announcement that the Fillmore West gig was Big Brother's last concert with Joplin, the band\u2014with Joplin still as lead vocalist\u2014toured the U.S. that fall. Reflecting Joplin's crossover appeal, two October 1968 performances at a roller rink in Alexandria, Virginia, were reviewed by John Segraves of the conservative ''[[Washington Evening Star]]'' at a time when the Washington metropolitan area's hard rock scene was in its infancy.<ref name=\"Segraves B6\">{{cite news |title=Janis Joplin Overwhelms |last=Segraves |first=John |date=October 21, 1968 |newspaper=[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]] |page=B6}}</ref> An opera buff at the time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vintagenewera.com/vintage/whoconcert.html |title=The Who in Concert |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021855/http://vintagenewera.com/vintage/whoconcert.html |archivedate=August 4, 2016}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> he wrote, \"Miss Joplin, in her early 20s, has been for the last year or two the vocalist with Big Brother and the Holding Company, a rock quintet of superior electric expertise.

This is the way she came across in a huge, high-ceilinged roller skating rink without any acoustics but, thankfully a good enough sound system behind her.

The band was influenced by the [[Stax Records|Stax-Volt]] [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by [[Otis Redding]] and [[the Bar-Kays]].<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> The Stax-Volt R&B sound was typified by the use of horns and had a funky, pop-oriented sound in contrast to many of the psychedelic/hard rock bands of the period.\n\nBy early 1969, Joplin was allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day (equivalent to $1300 in 2016 dollars)<ref name=\"caserta\"/> although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]''. Gabriel Mekler, who produced ''Kozmic Blues'', told publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman after Joplin's death that she had lived in his Los Angeles house during the June 1969 recording sessions at his insistence so he could keep her away from drugs and her drug-using friends.<ref name=\"buried\"/>\n\nJoplin's appearances with the Kozmic Blues Band in Europe were released in cinemas, in multiple documentaries. ''[[Janis (film)|Janis]]'', which was reviewed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' on March 21, 1975,<ref>{{cite news |title='Janis': Purified Joplin |last=Zito |first=Tom |date=March 21, 1975 |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=B11}}</ref> shows Joplin arriving in [[Frankfurt]] by plane and waiting inside a bus next to the Frankfurt venue, while an American female fan who is visiting Germany expresses enthusiasm to the camera (no security was used in Frankfurt, so by the end of the concert, the stage was so packed with people the band members could not see each other). ''Janis'' also includes interviews with Joplin in Stockholm and from her visit to [[London]], for her gig at [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The London interview was dubbed with a voiceover in the German language for broadcast on German television. John Byrne Cooke, road manager for Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band, wrote a book published in 2014 in which he revealed the illegal status of Joplin's ongoing use of narcotics.<ref name=\"on the road\">{{Cite book |title=On the Road With Janis Joplin |first=John Byrne |last=Cooke |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-425-27411-8 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>On Kozmic Blues' tour of Europe, Janis was terrified at every border crossing and customs inspection, knowing that the works and the smack she had stashed on her person could send her directly to jail on a tough rap to beat in foreign courts. But she was unwilling to go without, so she carried a supply everywhere, despite the risks.<ref name=\"on the road\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn the episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' that was telecast in the United States on the night of July 18, 1969, Joplin and her band performed \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\" as well as \"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\". As Dick Cavett interviewed Joplin, she admitted that she had a terrible time touring in Europe, claiming that audiences there are very uptight and don't \"[[get down]]\".\n\n[[File:ViewScan John Huddy review of Janis concert in Columbus Dispatch edition of Monday, May 12, 1969 page 23B -- 4X digital zoom0000.jpg|thumb|right|Newspaper review of Joplin's 1969 concert at Vets Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio includes the fact that before it started she walked to the lobby and watched audience members arrive.]]\nReleased in September 1969, the ''Kozmic Blues'' album was certified gold later that year but did not match the success of ''Cheap Thrills''.<ref name=\"craig\"/> Reviews of the new group were mixed. However, the album's recording quality and engineering, as well as the musicianship (including three performances by former [[Bob Dylan]]/[[Paul Butterfield]]/[[Electric Flag]] guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]]), were considered superior to her previous releases, and some music critics argued that the band was working in a much more constructive way to support Joplin's sensational vocal talents. Joplin wanted a horn section similar to that featured by the [[Chicago (band)|Chicago Transit Authority]]; her voice had the dynamic qualities and range not to be overpowered by the brighter horn sound.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}}\n\nSome music critics, however, including [[Ralph J. Gleason]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', were negative. Gleason wrote that the new band was a \"drag\" and Joplin should \"scrap\" her new band and \"go right back to being a member of Big Brother ... (if they'll have her).\"<ref name=\"scars\"/>\n\nOther reviewers, such as reporter [[Carl Bernstein]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', generally ignored the band's flaws and devoted entire articles to celebrating the singer's magic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ghostsofdc.org/2012/04/18/janis-joplin-plays-merriweather-three-weeks-before-woodstock/ |title=Janis Joplin Plays Merriweather Three Weeks Before Woodstock |author=Tom |date=2012-04-18 |website=Ghosts of DC |language=en-US |access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Bernstein's review said that Joplin \"has finally assembled a group of first-rate musicians with whom she is totally at ease and whose abilities complement the incredible range of her voice.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Janis -- All Together |last=Bernstein |first=Carl |date=July 26, 1969 |newspaper=The Washington Post and Times Herald |page=E1}}</ref>\n\nWhen Joplin and her back-up band performed at Vets Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday night, May 11, 1969, ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'' reviewer John Huddy wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Frequently suggestive with a series of limited but obvious moves, Miss Joplin wears hip-hugging silk bellbottoms and alternates between a wail and a teeth-rattling scream. Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling coarsely at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also has something to say in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love, and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo ... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked into the lobby and watched customers (sic) arrive. She was not recognized.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Kind of Town/Janis Joplin Wails |date=May 12, 1969 |newspaper=Columbus Dispatch |page=23B}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nColumbia Records released \"[[Kozmic Blues]]\" as a single, which peaked at number 41 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and a live rendition of \"Raise Your Hand\" was released in Germany and became a top ten hit there. Containing other hits like \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\", \"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\", and \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", ''I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!'' reached number five on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] soon after its release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-got-dem-ol-kozmic-blues-again-mama!-mw0000650335/awards |website=Allmusic |title=I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJoplin appeared at [[Woodstock]] starting at approximately 2:00&nbsp;a.m., on Sunday, August 17, 1969. Joplin informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. On Saturday afternoon, when she and the band were flown by helicopter with the pregnant [[Joan Baez]] and Baez's mother from a nearby motel to the festival site and Joplin saw the enormous crowd, she instantly became extremely nervous and giddy. Upon landing and getting off the helicopter, Joplin was approached by reporters asking her questions. She referred them to her friend and sometime lover Peggy Caserta as she was too excited to speak. Initially, Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin shot heroin and drank alcohol<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"caserta\"/> with Caserta, and by the time of reaching the stage, Joplin was \"[[wikt:three sheets to the wind|three sheets to the wind]]\".<ref name=\"scars\"/> During her performance, Joplin's voice became slightly hoarse and wheezy, and she struggled to dance.\n\nJoplin pulled through, however, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang \"Ball and Chain\". [[Pete Townshend]], who performed with [[the Who]] later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: \"She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Townshend |first=Pete |title=Who I am: a memoir |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2012 |pages=179}}</ref>\n\nJanis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00&nbsp;a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform.<ref name=\"Crosby 1988 161\u2013162\">{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=David |title=Long Time Gone |publisher=Doubleday|year=1988 |pages=161\u2013162}}</ref> This information was published by [[David Crosby]] in 1988.<ref name=\"Crosby 1988 161\u2013162\"/> Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in [[Joe Cocker]]'s van and witnessed [[list of performances and events at Woodstock Festival#Sunday, August 17 to Monday, August 18|Hendrix's close-of-show performance]], according to Baez's memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With'' (1989).<ref>{{cite book |last=Baez |first=Joan |title=And a Voice to Sing With |publisher=Summit Books |year=1989 |pages=163\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nStill photographs in color show Joplin backstage with [[Grace Slick]] the day after Joplin's performance, wherein Joplin appears to be very happy. Joplin was ultimately unhappy with her performance, however, and blamed Caserta. Her singing was not included (by her own insistence) in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'', although the 25th anniversary director's cut of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' includes her performance of \"[[Work Me, Lord]]\". The documentary film of the festival that was released to theaters in 1970 includes, on the left side of a [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], 37 seconds of footage of Joplin and Caserta walking toward Joplin's dressing room tent.<ref>{{YouTube|id=kvLno-hy_jE#t=1m44s |title=Footage of Joplin and Caserta begins at 1:44 and ends at 2:21}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Woodstock, Joplin also had problems at [[Madison Square Garden]], in 1969. Biographer Myra Friedman said she witnessed a duet Joplin sang with [[Tina Turner]] during [[the Rolling Stones]] concert at the Garden on [[Thanksgiving Day]]. Friedman said Joplin was \"so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania.\"<ref name=\"buried\"/> During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot.<ref name=\"buried\"/> For part of this concert she was joined onstage by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Paul Butterfield]].\n\nJoplin told rock journalist David Dalton that Garden audiences watched and listened to \"every note [she sang] with 'Is she gonna make it?' in their eyes.\"<ref name=\"dalton\"/> In her interview with Dalton she added that she felt most comfortable performing at small, cheap venues in San Francisco that were associated with the counterculture.\n\nAt the time of this June 1970 interview, she had already performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. Sam Andrew, the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"dalton\">{{Cite book |title=Piece Of My Heart |first=David |last=Dalton |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |date=August 21, 1991 |isbn=978-0-306-80446-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Janis Joplin 1970.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Joplin in 1970]]\nIn February 1970, Joplin traveled to [[Brazil]], where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites, who had designed the singer's stage costumes from 1967 to 1969.\n\nIn Brazil, Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. A Joplin biography written by her sister Laura said, \"David was an upper-middle-class Cincinnati kid who had studied communications at Notre Dame. ... [and] had joined the Peace Corps after college and worked in a small village in Turkey. ... He tried law school, but when he met Janis he was taking time off.\"<ref name=\"Joplin, Laura\"/>\n\n[[File:Janis studio.jpg|thumb|right|Joplin in 1970]]Niehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at [[Rio Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=\"dalton\"/> Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites' snapshots they \"look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: \"I'm going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don't have to be on stage twelve months a year. I've decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn added in 1992, \"Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about David was that he wasn't into drugs.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nWhen Joplin returned to the U.S., she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in [[Larkspur, California]]. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin's refusal to take some time off and travel the world with him.<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"Garvin, Glenn\" />\n\nAround this time, she formed her new band, known for a short time as Main Squeeze, then renamed the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> The band comprised mostly young Canadian musicians previously associated with [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie band than she did with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, \"It's ''my'' band. Finally it's ''my'' band!\"<ref name=\"scars\"/> In May 1970, after performing under the name Main Squeeze at a Hell's Angels event, the renamed Full Tilt Boogie Band began a nationwide tour. Joplin became very happy with her new group, which eventually received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics.<ref name=\"scars\"/>\n\n[[File:Janis San Rafael.jpg|thumb|left|poster for May 21, 1970 event that featured both Big Brother and Joplin's new band, then billed as Main Squeeze]] Prior to beginning a summer tour with Full Tilt Boogie, she performed in a reunion with Big Brother at the [[Fillmore West]], in San Francisco, on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included in an in-concert album released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at [[Winterland]], where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> She performed with the band, billed as Main Squeeze, at a party for the [[Hells Angels]] at a venue in [[San Rafael, California]] on May 21, 1970, according to a web site maintained by Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew.<ref name=\"samandrew\">{{cite web |url=http://samandrew.com/big-brother-history-part-six-1969-to-1972/ |title=Big Brother history, part six, 1969 to 1972 |first=Sam |last=Andrew |date=May 9, 2012 |website=samandrew.com |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> Andrew's web site quotes him as saying, \"This will be the first time that Janis' old band and her new band will be at the same venue, so everyone is a little on edge.\"<ref name=\"samandrew\"/>\n\nAccording to Joplin's biographer Ellis Amburn, Big Brother with its lead singer Nick Gravenites was the opening act at the party that was attended by 2,300 people.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of 240 dollars to perform.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Gravenites and Sam Andrew (who had resumed playing guitar with Big Brother) differed in their opinions of her performance and how substance abuse affected it.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Gravenites described her singing as \"stupendous,\" according to Amburn.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn quoted Andrew twenty years later: \"She was visibly deteriorating and she looked bloated. She was like a parody of what she was at her best. I put it down to her drinking too much and I felt a tinge of fear for her well-being. Her singing was real flabby, no edge at all.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nShortly thereafter, Joplin began wearing multi-coloured feather boas in her hair. (She had not worn them at the May 21 Hell's Angels party / concert in San Rafael).<ref name=\"samandrew\"/> By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nPreparing to board the all-star ''[[Festival Express]]'' train tour through Canada, members of Full Tilt Boogie passed through customs at what was then called Toronto International Airport. Road manager John Byrne Cooke recalled the scene in his 2014 book.<ref name=\"on the road\"/>\n\n<blockquote>The inspecting officers pass [band members except Joplin] through with a few perfunctory pokes in their bags while a diminutive officer with a solemn, round face begins a thorough search of Janis's luggage. Unaccountably, she seems to welcome his attention.\n\nHer suitcase looks as if she packed by throwing clothes at it from across the room. Her hippie handbag is overflowing with odds and ends scooped up at the last minute during the bleary rush of our early-morning departure [from a hotel in [[Schenectady, New York]] where they performed the previous night].\n\n\"Hey, man,\" Janis says to the small customs officer. \"Don't you want to look in here? That's my toilet kit, man, there might be some pills in there.\"\n\nWhat the hell is going on? I try to signal Janis to quit goading the inspector so we can get out of here before we all keel over from exhaustion. I'm afraid to do it too openly for fear of arousing more suspicion. Janis takes no notice.\n\nLike a sheep being led to the dipping trough, the officer follows Janis's direction. He heads straight for the toilet kit and pulls out a bag of powder. My heart skips a beat.\n\n\"What is this, 'ma'mselle'?\"\n\nJanis can scarcely contain herself. \"That's douche powder, honey!\" she proclaims, loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\n\"Ah, 'oui, oui, ma'mselle'.\" The little French-Canadian inspector almost chokes with embarrassment. His complexion explores the scarlet end of the spectrum while he moves on quickly to something safer. But he keeps searching. ...\n\nThe border watchdogs can search all day and never find a thing. Janis is clean. She is as respectable as a symphony conductor. She is proud and she is celebrating.\n\nThe boys [Full Tilt Boogie musicians] amuse themselves as best they can. [Pianist] Richard Bell passes the time with a yo-yo. Nothing fancy, just up and down, up and down, grinning as he watches Janis urge the inspector on. ...\n\nJanis prolongs the game until even the obtuse little customs inspector finally realizes that no one who has anything to hide would behave like this.<ref name=\"on the road\"/></blockquote>\n\nFrom June 28 to July 4, 1970, during the Festival Express tour, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie performed alongside [[Buddy Guy]], [[the Band]], [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Delaney & Bonnie]], [[Eric Andersen]], and [[Ian & Sylvia]].<ref name=\"amburn\"/> They played concerts in [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"dalton\"/> Joplin jammed with the other performers on the train, and her performances on this tour are considered to be among her greatest.\n\nJoplin headlined the festival on all three nights. At the last stop in Calgary, she took to the stage with [[Jerry Garcia]] while her band was tuning up. Film footage shows her telling the audience how great the tour was and she and Garcia presenting the organizers with a case of [[tequila]]. She then burst into a two-hour set, starting with \"[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]\". Throughout this performance, Joplin engaged in several banters about her love life. In one, she reminisced about living in a San Francisco apartment and competing with a female neighbor in flirting with men on the street. She finished the Calgary concert with long versions of \"Get It While You Can\" and \"Ball and Chain\".\n\nFootage of her performance of \"Tell Mama\" in Calgary became an [[MTV]] video in the early 1980s, and the audio from the same film footage was included on the ''[[Farewell Song]]'' (1982) album. The audio of other ''Festival Express'' performances was included on Joplin's ''In Concert'' (1972) album. Video of the performances was also included on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' DVD.\n\nThese performances of entire songs during the ''Festival Express'' concerts in Toronto and Calgary can be purchased, although other songs remain in vaults and have yet to be released.\n\nIn the \"Tell Mama\" video shown on MTV in the 1980s, Joplin wore a psychedelically colored, loose-fitting costume and feathers in her hair. This was her standard stage costume in the spring and summer of 1970. She chose the new costumes after her friend and designer, Linda Gravenites (whom Joplin had praised in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''{{'}}s profile of her in its May 1968 edition), cut ties with Joplin shortly after their return from Brazil, due largely to Joplin's continued use of heroin.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nDuring the ''Festival Express'' tour, Joplin was accompanied by ''Rolling Stone'' writer David Dalton, who later wrote several articles and two books on Joplin. She told Dalton:\n\n{{quote|I'm a victim of my own insides. There was a time when I wanted to know everything ... It used to make me very unhappy, all that feeling. I just didn't know what to do with it. But now I've learned to make that feeling work ''for'' me.

In her June 25, 1970 appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high school class reunion.

In a version of Friedman's book that she wrote twenty years later, she said about the hotel's claim of a phone call to City Hall, \"This may have been untrue.\"]<ref name=\"buried\"/>\n\nBy the time they returned to the studio, it was jammed. Nick Gravenites was there. So was song writer Bobby Womack. Bennett Glotzer [Albert Grossman's partner in their New York-based talent management company] was around. All in all, there were perhaps twenty to twenty-five people present. Janis did not sing that night, but merely listened to the instrumental track the band had completed that day. It was Nick's song, \"Buried Alive in the Blues.\"\n\nJanis was exhilarated by the prospect of doing the vocal on Sunday, a light like a sunburst in her smile and eyes.<ref name=\"buried\"/></blockquote>\n\nJoplin and Ken Pearson later left the studio together and she drove him and a male fan in her Porsche<ref name=\"buried\"/> to the West Hollywood landmark called [[Barney's Beanery]].

This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [Joplin's] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal more than most people comprehended. Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. She was, as [the psychiatric social worker she saw regularly in Beaumont, Texas in 1965 and 1966] Mr. [Bernard] Giarritano put it [in an interview with Friedman], \"diffused\" -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. That had as much to do with her original use of drugs [before she first met Giarritano] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women.

Some people insisted that a heroin overdose could not have happened as it did. The [[Medical Examiner]]'s Office of [[New York County]] [where Friedman lived] informs me that while it is more common for an OD to occur instantly after an injection, a delay until the moment of death is not so strikingly unusual. Clarifying this further, the ''[[Consumers Union]] Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs'' states that the term \"overdose\" is most frequently erroneous. The report cites information that those sudden deaths following an injection of heroin are actually the result of an [[adulteration]] of the product with various substances or of other mysterious factors: what is called a \"[[synergy#Drug synergy|synergistic reaction]]\" to a combination of drugs, for example, or of other [[toxicity|toxic factor]]s.

(This would later cause some people to attribute significance to the death of musicians at the age of 27, as celebrated in the notional '[[27 Club]]'.) Music historian Tom Moon wrote that Joplin had \"a devastatingly original voice\", music columnist [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Joplin as an artist was \"overpowering and deeply vulnerable\", and author [[Megan Terry]] said that Joplin was the female version of [[Elvis Presley]] in her ability to captivate an audience.<ref name=\"Joplin's Shooting Star\"/>\n\nA book about Joplin by her publicist Myra Friedman, titled ''Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin'' (1973),<ref>{{cite book |title=Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin |first=Myra |last=Friedman |date=1973 |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/buried-alive-myra-friedman/1100620841 |isbn=978-0-6880-0160-5 |publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> was excerpted in many newspapers.

The very first sentence in the book goes into more detail about that particular encounter. Caserta's language and description repelled many people at a time when few books or filmed interviews of Joplin or her loved ones were accessible to the public. Peggy Caserta was described as \"halfway between a [[groupie]] and a friend\" in an interview that writer Ellis Amburn did with Joplin's bandmate Sam Andrew circa 1990 and published in 1992.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Soon after the 1973 publication of ''Going Down With Janis'', Joplin's friends learned that graphic descriptions of sexual acts and intravenous drug use were not the only portions of the book that would haunt them.\n\nAccording to a statement in the early 1990s by a close friend of Caserta and Joplin's, Caserta's book angered the Los Angeles heroin dealer she described in detail, including the make and model of his car, for her book. According to Ellis Amburn, in 1973 a \"carful of dope dealers\" visited a Los Angeles lesbian bar Caserta had been frequenting since Joplin was alive.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn quoted Caserta's friend Kim Chappell, who was in the alley behind the bar: \"I was stabbed because, when Peggy's book came out, her dealer, the same one who'd given Janis her last fix, didn't like it that he was referred to and was out to get Peggy. He couldn't find her, so he went for her lover. When they realized who I was, they felt that my death would also hit Peggy, and so they stabbed me.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Despite being \"stabbed three times in the chest, puncturing both lungs,\" Chappell eventually recovered.<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nAccording to biographers, Caserta was one of many friends of Joplin's who did not become clean and sober until a very long time after the singer's death, while others died from overdoses.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> Although (Big Brother guitarist) James Gurley's wife, who was Joplin's close friend, died from a heroin overdose in 1969, he did not become clean and sober until 1984.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Caserta survived \"a near-fatal OD in December 1995,\" wrote [[Alice Echols]].<ref name=\"scars\"/> On January 13, 2000, Caserta appeared on-camera for a segment about Joplin on ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|xyTESUQWfV0|20/20 segment entitled \"Downtown\" originally broadcast on the ABC network on January 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nJoplin, along with [[Grace Slick]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]], opened opportunities in the rock music business for future female singers.<ref name=\"Joplin's Shooting Star\"/>\n\nJoplin's [[body art]], with a wristlet and a small heart on her left breast, by the San Francisco tattoo artist [[Lyle Tuttle]], was an early moment in the popular culture's acceptance of tattoos as art.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Deb |last=Acord |title=Who knew: Mommy has a tattoo |newspaper=[[Portland Press Herald]] |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Another trademark was her flamboyant hair styles, which often included colored streaks, and accessories such as scarves, beads, and feathers.

A [[Serge Gainsbourg]]-penned French language song by English singer [[Jane Birkin]], \"Ex fan des sixties\" (1978), references Joplin alongside other disappeared \"idols\" such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Brian Jones]], and [[Marc Bolan]]. When Joplin was alive, [[Country Joe McDonald]] released a song called \"Janis\" on his band's album ''[[I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die]]'' (1967).\n\nAt the 1976 [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], [[Nina Simone]], whom Joplin admired greatly, commented on Joplin and referred to the documentary ''[[Janis (film)|Janis]]'' (1975) that evidently was screened at the festival:\n\n{{quote|You know I made thirty-five albums, they bootlegged seventy.

For example, [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and the Machine]] spoke of Joplin's impact, in an interview for ''Why Music Matters'' that appeared in a commercial against piracy:\n\n{{quote|I learnt about Janis from an anthology of female blues singers. Janis was a fascinating character who bridged the gap between psychedelic blues and soul scenes. She was so vulnerable, self-conscious and full of suffering. She tore herself apart yet on stage she was totally different. She was so unrestrained, so free, so raw and she wasn't afraid to wail. Her connection with the audience was really important. It seems to me the suffering and intensity of her performance go hand in hand. There was always a sense of longing, of searching for something. I think she really sums up the idea that soul is about putting your pain into something beautiful.<ref>{{cite web |title=Florence and The Machine on Janis Joplin |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr7BNDFidog |website=Why Music Matters |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Stevie Nicks]] considers Joplin one of her idols, and has said:\n\n{{quote|You could say that being yelled at by Janis Joplin was one of the great honors of my life. Early in my career, Lindsey Buckingham and I were in a band called Fritz. There were two gigs we played in San Francisco that changed everything for me - One was opening up for Jimi Hendrix, who was completely magical. The other was the time that we opened up for Janis at the San Jose Fairgrounds, around 1970.\n\nIt was a hot summer day, and things didn't start off well because the entire show was running late. That meant our set was running over. We were onstage and going over pretty well, when I turned and saw a furious Janis Joplin on the side of the stage, yelling at us. She was screaming something like, \"What the fuck are you assholes doing? Get the hell off of my stage.\" Actually, she might have even been a little cruder than that \u2014 it was hard to hear.\n\nBut then Janis got up on that stage with her band, and this woman who was screaming at me only moments before suddenly became my new hero. Janis Joplin was not what anyone would call a great beauty, but she became beautiful because she made such a powerful and deep emotional connection with the audience. I didn't mind the feathers and the bell-bottom pants either. Janis didn't dress like anyone else, and she definitely didn't sing like anyone else.\n\nJanis put herself out there completely, and her voice was not only strong and soulful, it was painfully and beautifully real. She sang in the great tradition of the rhythm & blues singers that were her heroes, but she brought her own dangerous, sexy rock & roll edge to every single song. She really gave you a piece of her heart. And that inspired me to find my own voice and my own style.<ref>CD Liner Notes - Big Brother and the Holding Company's (Joplin's band) Live at Winterland '68</ref>}}\n\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] said about Joplin: \"She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve.
