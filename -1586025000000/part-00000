{"title_page": "Colonial charters in the Thirteen Colonies", "text_new": "A '''charter''' is a [[document]] that gave colonies the [[Droit de r\u00e9gale|legal rights]] to exist. Charters can bestow certain rights on a [[town]], [[city]], [[university]] or an institution.\n\nColonial Charters were empowered when the king gave a grant of exclusive powers for the governance of land to proprietors or a settlement company. The charters defined the relationship of the colony to the mother country, free from involvement from the Crown. For the trading companies, charters vested the powers of government in the company in England. The officers would determine the administration, laws, and ordinances for the colony, but only as conforming to the laws of England. [[Proprietary colony|Proprietary charters]] gave governing authority to the proprietor, who determined the form of government, chose the officers, and made laws, subject to the advice and consent of the freemen. All colonial charters guaranteed to the colonists the vague [[rights of Englishmen|rights and privileges of Englishmen]], which would later cause trouble during the revolutionary era. In the second half of the seventeenth century, the Crown looked upon charters as obstacles to colonial control, substituting the royal province for corporations and proprietary governments.\n\n==History==\nThe Virginia and Massachusetts charters were given to business corporations. Regular meetings of company officers and stockholders were the only governmental institutions required. The Virginia charter, [[Charter of 1606|issued in 1606]], and [[Second Virginia Charter|revised in 1609]] and 1612, was revoked upon bankruptcy of the sponsoring and organizing [[Virginia Company of London]] in 1624. The second Colonial Charter was granted to [[Colony of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]] in 1629, settling at [[Boston]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], a decade after the first \"New Englanders\" at [[Plymouth Colony]] further south towards [[Cape Cod]]. In 1684, the Chancery Court in England voided the charter and changed it to a royal colony. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] placed Massachusetts under the authority of the unified [[Dominion of New England]] in 1685. After [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] had ascended to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland, in addition to the stewardship of the Dutch Republic, they issued Massachusetts Bay a new liberal charter in 1691.\n\nCharles II granted Connecticut its charter in 1662 with the right of self-government. When [[James II of England|James II]] ascended the throne in 1685, he tried to revoke the Connecticut charter and sent  [[Edmund Andros|Sir Edmund Andros]] to receive it for the Crown. [[Joseph Wadsworth|Captain Joseph Wadsworth]] spirited the precious document out a window and stole the charter and hid it in a hollow oak tree, the \"[[Charter Oak incident|Charter Oak]],\" until James was overthrown. Connecticut temporarily lost the right of self-government under the unification of the several colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1687, but it was reinstated in 1689. The last charter by Charles II was issued to Rhode Island in 1663. [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] attained colonial charters as already established colonies that allowed them to elect their own governors.\n\nAs a result of political upheavals, especially after the three [[English Civil War]]s in the 1640s, and the later \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688 with their [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]--[[Church of England|Protestant/Anglican]] conflicts which also transformed into struggles between the [[King of England|King]] and [[English Parliament|Parliament]]. As these conflicts traveled across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], most colonies eventually surrendered their charters to the Crown by 1763 and became royal colonies as the King and his Ministers asserted more centralized control of their previously neglected and autonomous [[Thirteen Colonies]]. By the late 1600s, the colonial [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], had its Proprietary Charter to the [[Lords Baltimore]] revoked and had become a royal colony with its [[Governor of Maryland]] appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Monarch]] with the advice of his Ministers and the Colonial Offices and Board of Trade of members from [[British Parliament|Parliament]].\n\nBy 1776, when the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] and its lower [[History of Delaware|Delaware Bay counties]] remained proprietary colonies under a charter originally granted to [[William Penn]] and his heirs. The [[Province of Connecticut]] and the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Province of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] continued as corporation colonies under charters, and [[History of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] was governed as a royal province while operating under a charter after the unifying of the older \"Massachusetts Bay\" colony at [[History of Boston|Boston]] and the \"first landing\" colony, [[Plymouth Colony]] at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], with its famous \"[[Mayflower Compact]]\" from 1620. Further south, the [[Province of Virginia|Provinces of Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] to the undefined border with [[Spanish Florida]], all had their original charters dismissed with different opinions about the role and powers and taxing authority between the Royal Governors and their increasingly restless and defiant colonial Assemblies. The Royal Authority reasserted itself and becoming governed more directly from [[London]] with increasing friction as the 18th Century progressed to its [[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary]] climax.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies]]\n*[[Colonial history of the United States]]\n*[[Proprietary colony]]\n*[[State constitution (United States)]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp The Avalon Project: Colonial Charters, Grants, and Related Documents] Bibliography\n* Bridenbaugh, Carl.

Most corporations are, however, incorporated under the influential [[Delaware General Corporation Law]].]]\n'''United States corporate law''' regulates the [[corporate governance|governance]], [[corporate finance|finance]] and [[corporate capitalism|power]] of corporations in [[US law]]. Every [[List of states and territories of the United States|state and territory]] has its own basic corporate code, while [[federal law]] creates minimum standards for trade in company shares and governance rights, found mostly in the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]], as amended by laws like the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002]] and the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]. The [[US Constitution]] was interpreted by the [[US Supreme Court]] to allow corporations to incorporate in the state of their choice, regardless of where their headquarters are. Over the 20th century, most major corporations incorporated under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which offered lower corporate taxes, fewer shareholder rights against directors, and developed a specialized court and legal profession. Nevada has done the same. Twenty-four states follow the [[Model Business Corporation Act]],<ref>Lucian Bebchuk, ''The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power'' 118 [[Harvard Law Review]] 833, 844 (2004)</ref> while New York and California are important due to their size.\n\n==History==\n{{main|US corporate law history|UK company law history|US antitrust law|Corporation}}\nAt the [[Declaration of Independence]], corporations had been unlawful without explicit authorization in a [[Royal Charter]] or an [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Act of Parliament]] of the United Kingdom. Since the world's first [[stock market crash]] (the [[South Sea Bubble]] of 1720) corporations were perceived as dangerous. This was because, as the economist [[Adam Smith]] wrote in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), directors managed \"other people's money\" and this [[conflict of interest]] meant directors were prone to \"[[negligence]] and [[profusion]]\". Corporations were only thought to be legitimate in specific industries (such as [[Insurance in the United States|insurance]] or [[Banking in the United States|banking]]) that could not be managed efficiently through partnerships.<ref>cf [[Adam Smith|A Smith]], ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/119#Smith_0206-02_591 Book V, ch 1, \u00a7107]</ref> After the [[US Constitution]] was ratified in 1788, corporations were still distrusted, and were tied into debate about interstate exercise of sovereign power. The [[First Bank of the United States]] was chartered in 1791 by the [[US Congress]] to raise money for the government and create a common currency (alongside a [[Excise tax in the United States|federal excise tax]] and the [[US Mint]]). It had private investors (not government owned), but faced opposition from southern politicians who feared federal power overtaking state power. So, the First Bank's charter was written to expire in 20 years. State governments could and did also incorporate corporations through special legislation. In 1811, New York became the first state to have a simple public registration procedure to start corporations (not specific permission from the legislature) for manufacturing business.<ref>[[Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811]]</ref> It also allowed investors to have [[limited liability]], so that if the enterprise went bankrupt investors would lose their investment, but not any extra debts that had been run up to creditors. An early [[US Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward]]'',<ref name=\"ussc|periods=no|17|518|1819\">{{ussc|periods=no|17|518|1819}}</ref> went so far as to say that once a corporation was established a state legislature (in this case, New Hampshire) could not amend it. States quickly reacted by reserving the right to regulate future dealings by corporations.<ref>cf William A. Klein and [[John C. Coffee]], ''Business Organization and Finance'' 113\u2013114 (9th edn 2004) cf ''[[Gibbons v Ogden]]'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0022_0001_ZO.html 22 US 1] (1824) the right of Congress to regulate interstate trade under the commerce clause.</ref> Generally speaking, corporations were treated as \"[[legal person]]s\" with [[separate legal personality]] from its shareholders, directors or employees. Corporations were the subject of legal rights and duties: they could make contracts, hold [[property]] or commission [[torts]],<ref>See ''[[Louisville C&CR Co v Letson]]'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), a corporation is \"capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.\" ''[[Marshall v Baltimore & Ohio Railway Co]]'', 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854) \"those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,\" should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation.</ref> but there was no necessary requirement to treat a corporation as favorably as a real person.\n\n[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Bosses of the Senate\", corporate interests\u2013from steel, copper, oil, iron, sugar, tin, and coal to paper bags, envelopes, and salt\u2013as giant money bags looming over senators.<ref>[[Joseph Ferdinand Keppler|Joseph Keppler]], ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' (January 23, 1889)</ref>]]\nOver the late 19th century, more and more states allowed free incorporation of businesses with a simple registration procedure.<ref>See M Dodd, ''American Business Association Law a Hundred Years Ago and Today'' in ''Law: A Century of Progress: 1835\u20131935'' (Reppy 1937) 254 and Lawrence M. Friedman, ''A History of American Law'' (1973) 166\u2013175</ref> Many corporations would be small and democratically organized, with one-person, one-vote, no matter what amount the investor had, and directors would be frequently up for election. However, the dominant trend led towards immense corporate groups where the standard rule was [[one-share, one-vote]]. At the end of the 19th century, \"[[Trust law|trust]]\" systems (where formal ownership had to be used for another person's benefit) were used to concentrate control into the hands of a few people, or a single person. In response, the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890 was created to break up big business conglomerates, and the [[Clayton Act]] of 1914 gave the government power to halt [[mergers and acquisitions]] that could damage the public interest. By the end of the [[First World War]], it was increasingly perceived that ordinary people had little voice compared to the \"financial oligarchy\" of bankers and industrial magnates.<ref>See [[L Brandeis]], ''[[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It]]'' (1914)</ref> In particular, employees lacked voice compared to shareholders, but plans for a post-war \"[[industrial democracy]]\" (giving employees votes for investing their labor) did not become widespread.<ref>The Massachusetts governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] passed \"An Act to enable manufacturing corporations to provide for the representation of their employees on the board of directors\" (April 3, 1919) Chap. 0070. This was a measure that allowed corporations to voluntarily give workers votes. It remains in the Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, \u00a723</ref> Through the 1920s, power concentrated in fewer hands as corporations issued shares with multiple voting rights, while other shares were sold with no votes at all. This practice was halted in 1926 by public pressure and the [[New York Stock Exchange]] refusing to list non-voting shares.<ref>See [[William Z. Ripley]], ''Wall Street and Main Street'' (1927). The practice began again in 1986.</ref> It was possible to sell voteless shares in the economic boom of the 1920s, because more and more ordinary people were looking to the stock market to save the new money they were earning, but the law did not guarantee good information or fair terms. New shareholders had [[Inequality of bargaining power|no power to bargain]] against large corporate issuers, but still needed a place to save. Before the [[Wall Street Crash]] of 1929, people were being sold shares in corporations with fake businesses, as accounts and business reports were not made available to the investing public.\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=24em|salign=right|quote=over the enterprise and over the physical property \u2013 the instruments of production \u2013 in which he has an interest, the [[Shareholder|owner]] has little control. At the same time he bears no responsibility with respect to the enterprise or its physical property. It has often been said that the owner of a horse is responsible. If the horse lives he must feed it. If the horse dies he must bury it. No such responsibility attaches to a share of stock. The owner is practically powerless through his own efforts to affect the underlying [[property]] ... Physical property capable of being shaped by its owner could bring to him direct satisfaction apart from the income it yielded in more concrete form. It represented an extension of his own personality. With the corporate revolution, this quality has been lost to the property owner much as it has been lost to the worker through the [[industrial revolution]].|source= \u2014[[AA Berle]] and [[GC Means]], ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932) Book I, ch IV, 64}}\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash]] saw the total collapse of stock market values, as shareholders realized that corporations had become overpriced. They sold shares ''en masse'', meaning meant companies found it hard to get finance. The result was that thousands of businesses were forced to close, and they laid off workers. Because workers had less money to spend, businesses received less income, leading to more closures and lay-offs. This downward spiral began the [[Great Depression]]. Berle and Means argued that under-regulation was the primary cause in their foundational book in 1932, ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]''. They said directors had become too unaccountable, and the markets lacked basic transparency rules. This led directly to the [[New Deal]] reforms of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]]. A new [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] was empowered to require corporations disclose all material information about their business to the investing public. Because many shareholders were physically distant from corporate headquarters where meetings would take place, new rights were made to allow people to cast votes via proxies, on the view that this and other measures would make directors more accountable. Given these reforms, a major controversy still remained about the duties that corporations also owed to employees, other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, and the rest of society.<ref>[[AA Berle]], 'Corporate Powers As Powers in Trust' (1931) 44 Harvard Law Review 1049, [[EM Dodd]], 'For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?' (1932) 45 Harvard Law Review 1145 and [[AA Berle]], 'For Whom Corporate Managers Are Trustees: A Note' (1932) 45 Harvard Law Review 1365</ref> After [[World War II]], a general consensus emerged that directors were not bound purely to pursue \"[[shareholder value]]\" but could exercise their discretion for the good of all stakeholders, for instance by increasing wages instead of dividends, or providing services for the good of the community instead of only pursuing profits, if it was in the interests of the enterprise as a whole.<ref>e.g. ''[[AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow]]'', 13 N.J. 145, 98 A.2d 581, 39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953) and ''[[Shlensky v Wrigley]]'', 237 N.E. 2d 776 (Ill. App. 1968)</ref> However, different states had different corporate laws. To increase revenue from [[corporate tax]], individual states had an incentive to lower their standards in a \"[[race to the bottom]]\" to attract corporations to set up their headquarters in the state, particularly where directors controlled the decision to incorporate. \"[[Charter competition]]\", by the 1960s, had led Delaware to become home to the majority of the largest US corporations. This meant that the case law of the [[Delaware Chancery Court|Delaware Chancery]] and [[Delaware Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] became increasingly influential. During the 1980s, a huge takeover and merger boom decreased directors' accountability. To fend off a takeover, courts allowed boards to institute \"[[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]]s\" or \"[[shareholder rights plan]]s\", which allowed directors to veto any bid \u2013 and probably get a payout for letting a takeover happen. More and more people's retirement savings were being invested into the stock market, through [[pension fund]]s, [[life insurance]] and [[mutual funds]]. This resulted in a vast growth in the [[asset management]] industry, which tended to take control of voting rights. Both the financial sector's share of income, and executive pay for chief executive officers began to rise far beyond real wages for the rest of the workforce. The [[Enron scandal]] of 2001 led to some reforms in the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (on separating auditors from consultancy work). The [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] of 2007 led to minor changes in the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] (on soft regulation of pay, alongside [[derivative]] markets). However, the basic shape of corporate law in the United States has remained the same since the 1980s.\n\n==Corporations and civil law==\n{{see also|UK company law|Canadian corporate law|South African company law|German company law|European company law}}\n[[File:DMB-007-Small.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The state of Delaware is the place of incorporation for over 60 per cent of [[Fortune 500]] corporations.<ref>See [http://corplaw.delaware.gov/eng/why_delaware.shtml corplaw.delaware.gov].</ref> In 1999, from 6,530 publicly traded nonfinancial firms in the US, 3,771 (57.75%) were incorporated in Delaware, 283 (4.33%) in California, and 226 (3.46%) in New York.<ref>See L Bebchuk, A Cohen and A Ferrell, ''Does the Evidence Favor State Competition in Corporate Law?''

A corporation may be chartered in any of the 50 states (or the District of Columbia) and may become authorized to do business in each jurisdiction it does business within, except that when a corporation sues or is sued over a contract, the court, regardless of where the corporation's headquarters office is located, or where the transaction occurred, will use the law of the jurisdiction where the corporation was chartered (unless the contract says otherwise). So, for example, consider a corporation which sets up a concert in Hawaii, where its headquarters are in Minnesota, and it is chartered in Colorado, if it is sued over its actions involving the concert, whether it was sued in Hawaii (where the concert is located), or Minnesota (where its headquarters are located), the court in that state will still use Colorado law to determine how its corporate dealings are to be performed.\n\nAll major public corporations are also characterized by holding [[limited liability]] and having a centralized management.<ref>c.f. [[RC Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' (Aspen 1986) 2, who defines the modern public corporation by four main features: separate legal personality, limited liability, centralized management, and freely transferable shares.</ref> When a group of people go through the procedures to incorporate, they will acquire rights to make [[United States contract law|contracts]], to possess [[property]], to sue, and they will also be responsible for [[United States tort law|tort]]s, or other wrongs, and be sued. The federal government does not charter corporations (except National Banks, Federal Savings Banks, and Federal Credit Unions) although it does regulate them. Each of the 50 states plus DC has its own corporation law. Most large corporations have historically chosen to incorporate in Delaware, even though they operate nationally, and may have little or no business in Delaware itself. The extent to which corporations should have the same rights as real people is controversial, particularly when it comes to the [[fundamental rights]] found in the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. As a matter of law, a corporation acts through real people that form its board of directors, and then through the officers and employees who are appointed on its behalf. Shareholders can in some cases make decisions on the corporation's behalf, though in larger companies they tend to be passive. Otherwise, most corporations adopt [[limited liability]] so that generally shareholders cannot be sued for a corporation's commercial debts. If a corporation goes bankrupt, and is unable to pay debts to commercial creditors as they fall due, then in some circumstances state courts allow the so-called \"veil of incorporation\" to be pierced, and so to hold the people behind the corporation liable. This is usually rare and in almost all cases involves non-payment of [[trust fund tax]]es or willful misconduct, essentially amounting to fraud.\n\n===Incorporation and charter competition===\n{{main|Incorporation (business)|Regulatory competition}}\n{{Slist corporate acts}}\nAlthough every state will have slight differences in their requirements, the process of forming a new corporation is usually quick.<ref>See generally, WA Klein and JC Coffee, ''Business Organization and Finance: Legal and Economic Principles'' (9th edn Foundation 2004) 137\u2013140</ref> A corporation is not the only kind of business organization that can be chosen. People may wish to register a partnership or a [[Limited Liability Company]], depending on the precise [[Partnership taxation in the United States|tax status]] and organizational form that is sought.<ref>See also [[Limited liability limited partnership]]</ref> Most frequently, however, people will choose corporations which have [[limited liability]] for those who become the shareholders: if the corporation goes [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]] the default rule is that shareholders will only lose the money they paid for their shares, even if debts to commercial creditors are still unpaid. A state office, perhaps called the \"Division of Corporations\" or simply the \"Secretary of State\",<ref>e.g. in Delaware see the Division of Corporations at [http://corp.delaware.gov/howtoform.shtml corp.delaware.gov], in New York see the Division of Corporations at [http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/ dos.ny.gov/corps], and in California see the \"Business Entities\" section of the Secretary of State website at [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/ sos.ca.gov/business]</ref> will require the people who wish to incorporate to file \"[[articles of incorporation]]\" (sometimes called a \"charter\") and pay a fee. The articles of incorporation typically record the corporation's name, if there are any limits to its powers, purposes or duration, identify whether all shares will have the same rights. With this information filed with the state, a new corporation will come into existence, and be so be subject to legal rights and duties that the people involved create on its behalf. The incorporators will also have to adopt \"[[bylaws]]\" which identify many more details such as the number of directors, the arrangement of the board, requirements for corporate meetings, duties of officer holders and so on. The certificate of incorporation will have identified whether the directors or the shareholders, or both have the competence to adopt and change these rules. All of this is typically achieved through the corporation's first meeting.\n\n[[File:Corporate Income Tax as a Share of GDP, 1946 - 2009.png|left|thumb|[[Corporate tax in the United States|Corporate income tax]] as a share of GDP, 1946\u20132009.]]\nOne of the most important things that the articles of incorporation determine is the state of incorporation. Different states can have different levels of [[Corporate tax in the United States|corporate tax]] or [[franchise tax]], different qualities of shareholder and stakeholder rights, more or less stringent [[directors' duties]], and so on. However, it was held by the Supreme Court in ''[[Paul v Virginia]]'' that in principle states ought to allow corporations incorporated in a different state to do business freely.<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|75|168|1869}} and see Henry N. Butler, ''Nineteenth century jurisdictional competition in the granting of corporate privileges'' (1985) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/724319 14(1) Journal of Legal Studies 129]</ref> This appeared to remain true even if another state (e.g. Delaware) required significantly worse internal protections for shareholders, employees, creditors than the state in which the corporation operated (e.g. New York). So far, federal regulation has affected more issues relating to the securities markets than the balance of power and duties among directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that one state's laws will govern the \"[[Internal affairs doctrine|internal affairs]]\" of a corporation, to prevent conflicts among state laws.<ref>See ''[[Edgar v MITE Corp]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|457|624|1982}} White J., citing [[Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws]] \u00a7 302, Comment b, pp. 307\u2013308 (1971) Also ''[[VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996 v Examen Inc]]'', 871 A2d 1108, 1113 (2005) 'The internal affairs doctrine applies to those matters that pertain to the relationships among or between the corporation and its officers, directors, and shareholder.'</ref> So on the present law, regardless of where a corporation operates in the 50 states, the rules of the state of incorporation (subject to federal law) will govern its operation.<ref>Contrast the European Union decisions, including ''[[Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd]]'' (2003) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62001J0167:EN:HTML C-167/01] and see [[Simon Deakin]], ''Two Types of Regulatory Competition: Competitive Federalism versus Reflexive Harmonisation. A Law and Economics Perspective on Centros'' (1999) 2 Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies 231</ref> Early in the 20th century, it was recognized by some states, initially New Jersey, that the state could cut its tax rate in order to attract more incorporations, and thus bolster tax receipts.<ref>See [[William L.

Over the 20th century, the problem of a \"[[race to the bottom]]\" was increasingly thought to justify Federal regulation of corporations. The contrasting view was that [[regulatory competition]] among states could be beneficial, on the assumption that shareholders would choose to invest their money with corporations that were well governed. Thus the state's corporation regulations would be \"priced\" by efficient markets. In this way it was argued to be a \"race to the top\".<ref>See [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.|RK Winter]], 'State Law, Shareholder Protection, and the Theory of the Corporation' (1977) 6 J Leg Studies 251</ref> An intermediate viewpoint in the academic literature,<ref>This is vast.

See also</ref> Under most state laws, directors hold the exclusive power to allow a vote on amending the articles of incorporation, and shareholders must approve directors' proposals by a majority, unless a higher threshold is in the articles.\n\n===Corporate personality===\n{{Slist personality}}\n{{see also|Separate legal personality}}\nIn principle a duly incorporated business acquires \"[[legal personality]]\" that is separate from the people who invest their capital, and their labor, into the corporation. Just as the [[common law]] had for municipal and church corporations for centuries,<ref>e.g. ''[[Case of Sutton's Hospital]]'' (1612) 77 Eng Rep 960</ref> it was held by the Supreme Court in ''[[Bank of the United States v Deveaux]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|9|61|1809}}</ref> that in principle corporations had [[legal capacity]]. At its center, corporations being \"legal persons\" mean they can make contracts and other obligations, hold property, sue to enforce their rights and be sued for breach of duty. Beyond the core of private law rights and duties the question has, however, continually arisen about the extent to which corporations and real people should be treated alike. The meaning of \"person\", when used in a statute or the [[US Bill of Rights]] is typically thought to turn on the construction of the statute, so that in different contexts the legislature or founding fathers could have intended different things by \"person\". For example, in an 1869 case named ''[[Paul v Virginia]]'', the [[US Supreme Court]] held that the word \"citizen\" in the [[privileges and immunities clause]] of the [[US Constitution]] (article IV, section 2) did not include corporations.<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|75|168|1869}}</ref> This meant that the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] was entitled to require that a New York [[fire insurance]] corporation, run by Mr Samuel Paul, acquired a license to sell policies within Virginia, even though there were different rules for corporations incorporated within the state.<ref>The larger consequence was that insurance regulation remained state based, as the Court also held that insurance did not generally affect interstate commerce. This latter ruling was, however, overturned by ''[[United States v South-Eastern Underwriters Association]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|322|533|1944}}</ref> By contrast, in ''[[Santa Clara County v Southern Pacific Railroad Co]]'',<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|118|394|1886}}</ref> a majority of the Supreme Court hinted that a corporation might be regarded as a \"person\" under the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad Company]] had claimed it should not be subject to differential tax treatment, compared to natural persons, set by the [[State Board of Equalization]] acting under the [[Constitution of California]]. However, in the event [[John Marshall Harlan|Harlan J]] held that the company could not be assessed for tax on a technical point: the state county had included too much property in its calculations. Differential treatment between natural persons and corporations was therefore not squarely addressed.\n\n[[File:Supreme Court US 2010.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Citizens United v FEC]]'', the [[US Supreme Court]] in a 5 to 4 decision removed the power of state and federal legislatures to control unlimited spending by corporations on political campaigns, reasoning that corporations are \"persons\" under the [[First Amendment]].<ref name=\"usr|558|310|2010\">{{ussc|periods=no|558|310|2010}}</ref>]]\nIn the late 20th century, however, the issue of whether a corporation counted as a \"person\" for all or some purposes acquired political significance. Initially, in ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|424|1|1976}}</ref> a slight majority of the [[US Supreme Court]] had held that natural persons were entitled to spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their political campaigns. Over a strong dissent, the majority therefore held that parts of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] of 1974 were unconstitutional since spending money was, in the majority's view, a manifestation of the right to [[freedom of speech]] under the [[First Amendment]]. This did not affect corporations, though the issue arose in ''[[Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce]]''.<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|494|652|1990}}</ref> A differently constituted [[US Supreme Court]] held, with three dissents, that the Michigan Campaign Finance Act could, compatibly with the First Amendment, prohibit political spending by corporations. However, by 2010, the Supreme Court had a different majority. In a five to four decision, ''[[Citizens United v Federal Election Commission]]''<ref name=\"usr|558|310|2010\"/> held that corporations were persons that should be protected in the same was as natural people under the First Amendment, and so they were entitled to spend unlimited amounts of money in donations to political campaigns. This struck down the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002, so that an anti-[[Hillary Clinton]] advertisement (\"[[Hillary: The Movie]]\") could be run by a pro-business lobby group. Subsequently, the same Supreme Court majority decided in 2014, in ''[[Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc]]''<ref>573 US ___ (2014)</ref> that corporations were also persons for the protection of religion under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. Specifically, this meant that a corporation had to have a right to opt out of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010, which could require giving [[Health care in the United States|health care]] to employees that the board of directors of the corporation might have religious objections to. It did not specifically address an alternative claim under the [[First Amendment]]. The dissenting four judges emphasized their view that previous cases provided \"no support for the notion that free exercise [of religious] rights pertain to for-profit corporations.\"<ref>per Ginsburg J (dissenting), at page 14 of the dissent [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf 573 US ___] (2014)</ref> Accordingly, the issue of corporate personality has taken on an increasingly political character. Because corporations are typically capable of commanding greater economic power than individual people, and the actions of a corporation may be unduly influenced by directors and the largest [[shareholders]], it raises the issue of the corruption of democratic politics.<ref>cf Kennedy J (dissenting) ''[[Citizens United v Federal Election Commission]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|558|310|2010}}</ref>\n\n===Delegated management and agents===\n{{main|Employment contract|Agency (law)|US labor law}}\nAlthough a corporation may be considered a separate legal person, it physically cannot act by itself. There are, therefore, necessarily rules from the corporation statutes and the [[law of agency]] that attribute the acts of real people to the corporation, to make contracts, deal with property, commission torts, and so on. First, the board of directors will be typically appointed at the first corporate meeting by whoever the [[articles of incorporation]] identify as entitled to elect them. The board is usually given the collective power to direct, manage and represent the corporation. This power (and its limits) is usually delegated to directors by the state's law, or the articles of incorporation.<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] [http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml \u00a7141(a)], \"The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.\" [[California Corporations Code]] [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&group=00001-01000&file=300-318 \u00a7300(a)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113085241/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&group=00001-01000&file=300-318 |date=November 13, 2012 }}. [[NYBCL]] [http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/BSC/7/701 \u00a7701], \"Subject to any provision in the certificate of incorporation authorized by ... [the] certificate of incorporation as to control of directors ... the business of a corporation shall be managed under the direction of its board of directors ... \" This is a change from an old ''dictum'' in ''[[Manson v Curtis]]'', 119 NE 559, 562 (NY 1918) where it was said that a director's powers are \"original and undelegated\". For support for this position, see Johannes Zahn, ''Wirtschaftsf\u00fchrertum und Vertragsethik im Neuen Aktienrecht'' 95 (1934) reviewed by [[Friedrich Kessler]] (1935) [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3658&context=fss_papers 83 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 393] and [[Stephen Bainbridge]], ''Director Primacy and Shareholder Disempowerment'', 119(6) Harvard Law Review 1735, 1746, fn 59 (2006)</ref> Second, corporation laws frequently set out roles for particular \"officers\" of the corporation, usually in senior management, on or outside of the board. [[US labor law]] views directors and officers as holding [[contracts of employment]], although not for all purposes.<ref>See ''[[NLRB v Bell Aerospace Co]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|416|267|1974}} excluding \"managerial employees\" from the scope of the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 \u00a72(3) and (11). See further [[A Cox]], DC Bok, RA Gorman and MW Finkin, ''Labor Law Cases and Materials'' (14th edn 2006) 92\u201397</ref> If the state law, or the corporation's bylaws are silent, the terms of these contracts will define in further detail the role of the directors and officers. Third, directors and officers of the corporation will usually have the authority to delegate tasks, and hire employees for the jobs that need performing. Again, the terms of the employment contracts will shape the express terms on which employees act on behalf of the corporation.\n\n[[File:BaristaCountingTips.jpg|thumb|left|The actions of all employees, in the course of employment become those of the corporation, when it goes right or wrong because it is thought that if a corporation takes the benefits of an employee's work, it should also take the burdens.<ref>cf ''[[Turberville v Stampe]]'' (1697) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1792/2684.pdf 91 ER 1072], per [[Lord Holt CJ]]</ref>]]\nToward the outside world, the acts of directors, officers and other employees will be binding on the corporation depending on the [[law of agency]] and principles of [[vicarious liability]] (or ''[[respondeat superior]]''). It used to be that the common law recognized constraints on the total capacity of the corporation. If a director or employee acted beyond the purposes or powers of the corporation (''[[ultra vires]]''), any contract would be ''ex ante'' void and unenforceable. This rule was abandoned in the earlier 20th century,<ref>See RS Stevens, 'A Proposal as to the Codification and Restatement of the Ultra Vires Doctrine' (1927) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/788703 36(3) Yale Law Journal 297] and MA Schaeftler, 'Ultra Vires \u2013 Ultra Useless: The Myth of State Interest in Ultra Vires Acts of Business Corporations' (1983\u20131984) Journal of Corporation Law 81</ref> and today corporations generally have unlimited capacity and purposes.<ref>Revised [[Model Business Corporation Act|MBCA]] \u00a73.01(a) presumption that a corporation's purpose is to 'engage in any lawful business unless a more limited purpose is set forth in the articles of incorporation.' Also \u00a73.04, precludes a corporation from asserting ''ultra vires'' as a defense from having contracts enforced against it.</ref> However, not all actions by corporate agents are binding. For instance, in ''[[South Sacramento Drayage Co v Campbell Soup Co]]''<ref>220 Cal App2d 851, (3d Dist 1963)</ref> it was held that a traffic manager who worked for the [[Campbell Soup Company]] did not (unsurprisingly) have authority to enter a 15-year exclusive dealing contract for intrastate hauling of tomatoes. Standard principles of commercial agency apply (\"[[apparent authority]]\"). If a reasonable person would not think that an employee (given his or her position and role) has authority to enter a contract, then the corporation cannot be bound.<ref>See further, [[Restatement of the Law of Agency]] (3rd edn 2006)</ref> However, corporations can always expressly confer greater authority on officers and employees, and so will be bound if the contracts give express or implied [[actual authority]]. The treatment of liability for contracts and other consent based obligations, however, differs to [[torts]] and other wrongs. Here the objective of the law to ensure the internalization of \"[[externalities]]\" or \"[[enterprise risks]]\" is generally seen to cast a wider scope of liability.\n\n===Shareholder liability for debts===\n{{See also|Enterprise liability|Limited liability|Piercing the corporate veil}}\n{{Slist piercing}}\nOne of the basic principles of modern corporate law is that people who invest in a corporation have [[limited liability]]. For example, as a general rule shareholders can only lose the money they invested in their shares. Practically, limited liability operates only as a [[default rule]] for creditors that can adjust their risk.<ref>LA Bebchuk and JM Freid, 'The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy' (1996) 105 Yale LJ 857, 881\u2013890</ref> Banks which lend money to corporations frequently contract with a corporation's directors or shareholders to get personal [[guarantee]]s, or to take [[security interest]]s their personal assets, or over a corporation's assets, to ensure their debts are paid in full. This means much of the time, shareholders are in fact liable beyond their initial investments. Similarly [[trade creditors]], such as suppliers of raw materials, can use [[title retention clause]] or other device with the equivalent effect to security interests, to be paid before other creditors in bankruptcy.<ref>All such interests need to be registered to take effect under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/9/ art 9]</ref> However, if creditors are unsecured, or for some reason guarantees and security are not enough, creditors cannot (unless there are exceptions) sue shareholders for outstanding debts. Metaphorically speaking, their liability is limited behind the \"corporate veil\". The same analysis, however has been rejected by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Davis v Alexander]]'',<ref>{{ussc|269|114|1925}}</ref> where a railroad subsidiary company caused injury to cattle that were being transported. As [[Brandeis J]] put it, when one \"company actually controls another and operates both as a single system, the dominant company will be liable for injuries due to the [[negligence]] of the subsidiary company.\"\n\n[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The [[International Court of Justice]] in ''[[Re Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co, Ltd]]''<ref>[1970] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1970/1.html ICJ 1]</ref> acknowledged that there is invariably a principle of piercing the veil to prevent abuse of the corporate form.]]\nThere are a number of exceptions, which differ according to the law of each state, to the principle of limited liability. First, at the very least, as is recognized in [[public international law]],<ref>See ''[[Re Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co, Ltd]]'' [1970] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1970/1.html ICJ 1]</ref> courts will \"pierce the corporate veil\" if a corporation is being used evade obligations in a dishonest manner. Defective organization, such as a failure to duly file the articles of incorporation with a state official, is another universally acknowledged ground.<ref>e.g. [[Model Business Corporation Act|MBCA]] \u00a72.04</ref> However, there is considerable diversity in state law, and controversy, over how much further the law ought to go. In ''[[Kinney Shoe Corp v Polan]]''<ref>939 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1991)</ref> the [[Fourth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals]] held that it would also pierce the veil if (1) the corporation had been inadequately capitalized to meet its future obligations (2) if no corporate formalities (e.g. meetings and minutes) had been observed, or (3) the corporation was deliberately used to benefit an associated corporation. However, a subsequent opinion of the same court emphasized that piercing could not take place merely to prevent an abstract notion of \"unfairness\" or \"injustice\".<ref>See ''[[Perpetual Real Estate Services Inc v Michaelson Properties Inc]]'', 974 F2d 545 (4th Cir 1992)</ref> A further, though technically different, equitable remedy is that according to the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Taylor v Standard Gas Co]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|306|307|1939}} known as the \"Deep Rock doctrine\"</ref> corporate insiders (e.g. directors or major shareholders) who are also creditors of a company are subordinated to other creditors when the company goes bankrupt if the company is inadequately capitalized for the operations it was undertaking.\n\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 100506-N-6070S-230.jpg|thumb|right|The trend in US corporate tort cases, particularly in oil spill disasters, as with ''[[The Amoco Cadiz]]'' case and in the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' [[Deepwater Horizon litigation|litigation]], is to either pierce the corporate veil or hold parent corporations directly liable for the harm their enterprise causes.]]\n[[Tort]] victims differ from commercial creditors because they have no ability to contract around limited liability, and are therefore regarded differently under most state laws. The theory developed in the mid-20th century that beyond the corporation itself, it was more appropriate for the law to recognize the economic \"enterprise\", which usually composes [[groups of corporations]], where the parent takes the benefit of a subsidiary's activities and is capable of exercising decisive influence.<ref>See generally [[AA Berle]], 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1118398 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343]</ref> A concept of \"[[enterprise liability]]\" was developed in fields such tax law, accounting practices, and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]] that were gradually received into the courts' jurisprudence. Older cases had suggested that there was no special right to pierce the veil in favor of tort victims, even where pedestrians had been hit by a tram owned by a bankrupt-subsidiary corporation,<ref>''[[Berkey v Third Avenue Railway]]'', 244 NY 602 (1927)</ref> or by taxi-cabs that were owned by undercapitalized subsidiary corporations.<ref>e.g. ''[[Walkovszky v Carlton]]'' 223 NE2d 6 (NY 1966). Contrast the dissent of [[Kenneth Keating|Keating J]] and the Californian decision ''[[Minton v Cavaney]]'', 56 Cal2d 576 (1961). [[Roger Traynor|Traynor J]] held the veil would be pierced when shareholders \"provide inadequate capitalization and actively participate in the conduct of corporate affairs.\" This meant the family of a girl who drowned in a swimming pool would be compensated.</ref> More modern authority suggested a different approach. In a case concerning one of the worst [[oil spill]]s in history, caused by the ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'' which was owned through subsidiaries of the [[Amoco Corporation]], the Illinois court that heard the case stated that the parent corporation was liable by the fact of its group structure.<ref>''[[In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz off the Coast of France on March 16, 1978]]'', 1984 AMC 2123 (ND Ill 1984), McGarr J, at 2191, \"As an integrated multinational corporation which is engaged through a system of subsidiaries in the exploration, production, refining, transportation and sale of petroleum products throughout the world, Standard is responsible for the tortious acts of its wholly owned subsidiaries and instrumentalities, AIOC and Transport.\"</ref> The courts therefore \"usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases\" because tort claimants do not voluntarily accept limited liability.<ref>''[[Perpetual Real Estate Services Inc v Michaelson Properties Inc]]'', 974 F2d 545 (4th Cir 1992) citing WM Fletcher, ''Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations'' (1990) \u00a7 41.85 at 71, \"courts usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases. This is because the party seeking relief in a contract case is presumed to have voluntarily and knowingly entered into an agreement with a corporate entity, and is expected to suffer the consequences of the limited liability associated with the corporate business form, while this is not the situation in tort cases.\" c.f. ''[[Fletcher v Atex Inc]]'' 8 F.3d 1451 (2d Cir. 1995)</ref> Under the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980]], the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v Bestfoods]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|524|51|1998}}</ref> held if a parent corporation \"actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of\" a subsidiary's facilities it \"may be held directly liable\". This leaves the question of the nature of the common law, in absence of a specific statute, or where a state law forbids piercing the veil except on very limited grounds.<ref>e.g. Texas Business Corporation Act of 1997, art 2.21(2)</ref> One possibility is that tort victims go uncompensated, even while a parent corporation is solvent and has insurance. A second possibility is that a compromise liability regime, such as [[pro rata]] rather than [[joint and several liability]] is imposed across all shareholders regardless of size.<ref>Henry Hansmann and Reiner Kraakman, ''Towards Unlimited Liability for Corporate Torts'' 100(7) Yale Law Journal 1879, 1900\u20131901 (1991)</ref> A third possibility, and one that does not interfere with the basics of corporate law, is that a direct duty of care could be owed in [[tort]] to the injured person by parent corporations and major shareholders to the extent they could exercise control. This route means corporate enterprise would not gain a subsidy at the expense of other people's health and environment, and that there is no need to pierce the veil.\n\n==Corporate governance==\n{{see also|Corporate governance}}\n[[File:NYSE127.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[New York Stock Exchange]], along with Federal and state laws, is a significant regulator of corporate governance for listed corporations, particularly on shareholder voting rights and board structures.]]\n[[Corporate governance]], though used in many senses, is primarily concerned with the balance of power among the main actors in a corporation: directors, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.<ref>See [[Peter Gourevitch]] and James Shinn, ''Political Power and Corporate Control'' (Princeton 2005) 4</ref> A combination of a state's corporation law, case law developed by the courts, and a corporation's own [[articles of incorporation]] and [[bylaws]] determine how power is shared. In general, the rules of a corporation's constitution can be written in whatever way its incorporators choose, or however it is subsequently amended, so long as they comply with the minimum compulsory standards of the law. Different laws seek to protect the corporate [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s to different degrees. Among the most important are the voting rights they exercise against the board of directors, either to elect or remove them from office. There is also the right to sue for breaches of duty, and rights of information, typically used to buy, sell and associate, or disassociate on the market.<ref>See [[Robert C. Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' 86 (Aspen 1986)</ref> The federal [[Securities and Exchange Act]] of 1934, requires minimum standards on the process of voting, particularly in a \"[[proxy contest]]\" where competing groups attempt to persuade shareholders to delegate them their \"[[Proxy voting|proxy]]\" vote. Shareholders also often have rights to amend the corporate constitution, call meetings, make business proposals, and have a voice on major decisions, although these can be significantly constrained by the board. Employees of US corporations have often had a voice in corporate management, either indirectly, or sometimes directly, though unlike in many major economies, express \"[[codetermination]]\" laws that allow participation in management have so far been rare.\n\n===Corporate constitutions===\n{{Slist constitution}}\n{{main|Articles of Incorporation|Corporate constitution}}\nIn principle, a corporation's constitution can be designed in any way so long as it complies with the compulsory rules set down by the state or federal legislature. Most state laws, and the federal government, give a broad freedom to corporations to design the relative rights of directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders in the [[articles of incorporation]] and the [[by-laws]]. These are written down during incorporation, and can usually be amended afterwards according to the state law's procedures, which sometimes place obstacles to amendment by a simple majority of shareholders.<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] \u00a7242(b)(1) requires a resolution by the directors, and then a majority vote of shareholders, and the affected classes of shareholder.</ref> In the early 1819 case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward]]''<ref name=\"ussc|periods=no|17|518|1819\"/> the [[US Supreme Court]] held by a majority that there was a presumption that once a corporate charter was made, the corporation's constitution was subject to \"no other control on the part of the Crown than what is expressly or implicitly reserved by the charter itself.\"<ref>cf William A. Klein and [[John C. Coffee]], ''Business Organization and Finance'' 113\u2013114 (9th edn 2004) \"The decision evoked much contemporary protest, because to many it seemed to imply that once a corporate charter was granted, the corporation was beyond legislative control. In fact, its significance was more limited than this because, as Justice Story pointed out ... the state could insert a provision in any charter that it granted reserving its right to amend or further condition the charter.\"</ref> On the facts, this meant that because [[Dartmouth College]]'s charter could not be amended by the New Hampshire legislature, though subsequent state corporation laws subsequently included provisions saying that this could be done. Today there is a general presumption that whatever balance of powers, rights and duties are set down in the constitution remain binding like a [[Contract law in the United States|contract]] would.<ref>cf, the English Court of Appeal case, ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34, cited in Jesse H. Choper, [[John C. Coffee]] and Ronald J. Gilson, ''Cases and Materials on Corporations'' (8th Edition 2012)</ref> Most corporation statutes start with a presumption (in contrast to old ''[[ultra vires]]'' rules) that corporations may pursue any purpose that is lawful,<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] \u00a7102(b)</ref> whether that is running a profitable business, delivering services to the community, or any other objects that people involved in a corporation may choose. By default, the common law had historically suggested that all decisions are to be taken by a majority of the incorporators,<ref>''[[Attorney General v Davy]]'' (1741) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1741/14.pdf 26 ER 531], per [[Lord Hardwicke LC]]</ref> and that by default the board could be removed by a majority of shareholders for a reason they themselves determined.<ref>''[[R v Richardson]]'' (1758) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1758/158.pdf 97 ER 426], per [[Lord Mansfield]]</ref> However these default rules will take subject to the constitution that incorporators themselves define, which in turn take subject to state law and federal regulation.\n\n[[File:NASDAQ stock market display.jpg|thumb|left|The [[NASDAQ]] is the second biggest stock in the US, after the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. It specializes in IT sector, that saw its first major crash with the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000.]]\nAlthough it is possible to structure corporations differently, the two basic organs in a corporate constitution will invariably be the [[general meeting]] of its members (usually shareholders) and the board of directors.<ref>cf ''[[Manson v Curtis]]'', 223 NY 313, 119 NE 559 (1918) holding that the board of directors could not be effectively abolished so as to allow large shareholders to dominate.</ref> Boards of directors themselves have been subject in modern regulation to a growing number of requirements regarding their composition, particularly in federal law for public corporations. Particularly after the [[Enron scandal]], companies listed on the major stock exchanges (the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the [[NASDAQ]], and [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]]) were required to adopt minimum standards on the number of [[independent director]]s, and their functions. These rules are enforced through the threat of delisting by the exchange, while the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] works to ensure ultimate oversight. For example, the [[NYSE Listed Company Manual]] Rule 303A.01 requires that listed companies have a majority of \"independent\" directors.<ref>See also NASDAQ Rule 4350(c)(1)</ref> \"Independence\" is in turn defined by Rule 303A.02 as an absence of material business relationship with the corporation, not having worked for the last three years for the corporation as an employee, not receiving over $120,000 in pay, or generally having family members who are.<ref>See [[NYSE Listed Company Manual]] [http://nysemanual.nyse.com/LCMTools/PlatformViewer.asp?selectednode=chp_1_4&manual=%2Flcm%2Fsections%2Flcm-sections%2F Rule 303A.02]</ref> The idea here is that \"independent\" directors will exercise superior oversight of the executive board members, and thus decrease the likelihood of abuse of power. Specifically, the [[nominations committee]] (which makes future board appointments), [[compensation committee]] (which sets director pay), and [[audit committee]] (which appoints the auditors), are required to be composed of independent directors, as defined by the Rules.<ref>NYSE Rule 303A.04-06. See also NASDAQ Rule 4350(c)(3)-(4) allows one of three directors to lack \"independence\" if he or she is not an officer or family member of an officer.</ref> Similar requirements for boards have proliferated across many countries,<ref>This is generally thought to have begun with the UK [[Cadbury Report]].</ref> and so exchange rules allow foreign corporations that are listed on an American exchange to follow their home jurisdiction's rules, but to disclose and explain how their practices differ (if at all) to the market.<ref>e.g. NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.11</ref> The difficulty, however, is that oversight of executive directors by independent directors still leaves the possibility of personal relationships that develop into a conflict of interest. This raises the importance of the rights that can be exercised against the board as a whole.\n\n===Shareholder rights===\n{{Slist shareholder rights}}\n{{see also|Institutional investor|Shareholder}}\nWhile the board of directors is generally conferred the power to manage the day-to-day affairs of a corporation, either by the statute, or by the [[articles of incorporation]], this is always subject to limits, including the rights that [[shareholders]] have. For example, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] \u00a7141(a) says the \"business and affairs of every corporation ... shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.\"<ref>[[DGCL]] [http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml#TopOfPage \u00a7141(a)] Also see [[DGCL]] \u00a7350, shareholder agreements may only affect a board's discretion in close corporations, and ''[[Galler v Galler]]'', 32 Ill2d 16 (1964)</ref> However, directors themselves are ultimately accountable to the general meeting through the vote. Invariably, shareholders hold the voting rights,<ref>This is not inevitable, as in corporations without shareholders, or those which may choose to give a voice to employees, e.g. Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, [https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156/Section23 \u00a723]</ref> though the extent to which these are useful can be conditioned by the constitution. The [[DGCL]] \u00a7141(k) gives an option to corporations to have a unitary board that can be removed by a majority of members \"without cause\" (i.e. a reason determined by the [[general meeting]] and not by a court), which reflects the old default common law position.<ref>''[[Attorney General v Davy]]'' (1741) 2 Atk 212 and ''[[R v Richardson]]'' (1758) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1758/158.pdf 97 ER 426]</ref> However, Delaware corporations may also opt for a [[classified board of directors]] (e.g. where only a third of directors come up for election each year) where directors can only be removed \"with cause\" scrutinized by the courts.<ref>The case law on the meaning of \"with cause\" is conflicting. In New York, see ''[[Fox v Cody]]'', 141 Misc 552, 252 NYS 395 (Sup Ct 1930) and ''[[Auer v Dressel]]'', 306 NY 427, 118 NE 2d 590, 593 (1954) and in Delaware, see ''[[Campbell v Loew's Inc]]'', 36 Del Ch 563, 134 A 2d 852 (Ch 1957) referring back to ''Auer''.</ref> More corporations have classified boards after [[initial public offerings]] than a few years after going public, because [[institutional investors]] typically seek to change the corporation's rules to make directors more accountable.<ref>Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock, ''Embattled CEOs'', 88(5) Texas Law Review 987, 1008 (2010)</ref> In principle, shareholders in Delaware corporations can make appointments to the board through a majority vote,<ref>[[DGCL]] \u00a7211(b)</ref> and can also act to expand the size of the board and elect new directors with a majority.<ref>[[DGCL]] \u00a7228</ref> However, directors themselves will often control which candidates can be nominated to be appointed to the board. Under the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010, \u00a7971 empowered the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to write a new SEC Rule 14a-11 that would allow shareholders to propose nominations for board candidates. The Act required the SEC to evaluate the economic effects of any rules it wrote, however when it did, the [[Business Roundtable]] challenged this in court. In ''[[Business Roundtable v SEC]]'',<ref>647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011)</ref> [[Douglas H. Ginsburg|Ginsburg J]] in the [[DC Circuit Court of Appeals]] went as far to say that the SEC had \"acted arbitrarily and capriciously\" in its rule making. After this, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] failed to challenge the decision, and abandoned drafting new rules. This means that in many corporations, directors continue to have a monopoly on nominating future directors.\n\n[[File:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] has a statutory duty to regulate some aspects of director elections and shareholder voting rights, though its rule-making authority has continually been challenged by the [[Business Roundtable]].<ref>See ''[[Business Roundtable v Securities and Exchange Commission (2011)|Business Roundtable v SEC]]'', 647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011) and ''[[Business Roundtable v Securities and Exchange Commission (1990)|Business Roundtable v SEC]]'', 905 F2d 406 (DC Cir 1990)</ref>]]\nApart from elections of directors, shareholders' entitlements to vote have been significantly protected by federal regulation, either through stock exchanges or the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Beginning in 1927, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] maintained a \"[[one share, one vote]]\" policy, which was backed by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] from 1940.<ref>See [[Joel Seligman]], ''Equal Protection in Shareholder Voting Rights: The One Common Share, One Vote Controversy'', 54 George Washington Law Review 687 (1986)</ref> This was thought to be necessary to halt corporations issuing non-voting shares, except to banks and other influential corporate insiders.<ref>See [[William Z. Ripley]], ''Two Changes in the Nature and Conduct of Corporations'' 11(4) Trade Associations and Business Combinations 143 (1926); or Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York 695</ref> However, in 1986, under competitive pressure from [[NASDAQ]] and [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]], the NYSE sought to abandon the rule, and the SEC quickly drafted a new Rule 19c-4, requiring the one share, one vote principle. In ''[[Business Roundtable v SEC]]''<ref>905 F 2d 406 (DC Cir 1990)</ref> the [[DC Circuit Court of Appeals]] struck the rule down, though the exchanges and the SEC subsequently made an agreement to regulate shareholder voting rights \"proportionately\". Today, many corporations have unequal shareholder voting rights, up to a limit of ten votes per share.<ref>e.g. [[NYSE Listed Company Manual]] \u00a7313.00</ref> Stronger rights exist regarding shareholders ability to delegate their votes to nominees, or doing \"[[proxy voting]]\" under the [[Securities and Exchange Act]] of 1934. Its provisions were introduced to combat the accumulation of power by directors or management friendly [[voting trusts]] after the [[Wall Street Crash]]. Under SEC Rule 14a-1, proxy votes cannot be solicited except under its rules. Generally, one person soliciting others' proxy votes requires disclosure, although SEC Rule 14a-2 was amended in 1992 to allow shareholders to be exempt from filing requirements when simply communicating with one another,<ref>See, SEC Release No. 34-31326 (October 16, 1992) changing rules so that (1) preparing and filing proxy statements are not needed if a person is not seeking to obtain voting authority from another person, but owners of over $5m are required. (2) no prior review of preliminary proxy solicitation materials (3) proxies are required to unbundle proposals so there are separate votes on each.</ref> and therefore to take [[collective action]] against a board of directors more easily. SEC Rule 14a-9 prohibits any false or misleading statements being made in soliciting proxies. This all matters in a [[proxy contest]], or whenever shareholders wish to change the board or another element of corporate policy. Generally speaking, and especially under Delaware law, this remains difficult. Shareholders often have no rights to call meetings unless the constitution allows,<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] \u00a7211(d). See also, SEC 13d-5, dating from times when groups of investors were considered potential [[cartel]]s, saying any 5% shareholder voting block must register with the Federal financial authority, the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]].</ref> and in any case the [[Parliamentary procedure in the corporate world|conduct of meetings]] is often controlled by directors under a corporation's [[by-laws]]. However, under SEC Rule 14a-8, shareholders have a right to put forward proposals, but on a limited number of topics (and not director elections).<ref>SEC [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=17:4.0.1.1.1&rgn=div5#17:4.0.1.1.1.2.87.231 Rule 14a-8]</ref>\n\n[[File:CEO pay v. average slub.png|upright=1.6|right|thumb|Ratio of average pay of CEOs and production workers within a corporation from 1965 to 2009, not taking into account [[Outsourcing|outsourced workers]], or [[supply chains]].<ref>Economic Policy Institute, '[http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/view/17 More compensation heading to the very top: 1965\u20132009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124040839/http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/view/17 |date=November 24, 2011 }}' (May 16, 2011) Based on data from Wall Street Journal/Mercer, Hay Group 2010.</ref>]]\nOn a number of issues that are seen as very significant, or where directors have incurable conflicts of interest, many states and federal legislation give shareholders specific rights to veto or approve business decisions. Generally state laws give the right for shareholders to vote on decision by the corporation to sell off \"all or substantially all assets\" of the corporation.<ref>DGCL \u00a7271, and cf ''[[Katz v Bregman]]'', 431 A2d 1274 (1981) includes assets under 50% of the company's value.</ref> However fewer states give rights to shareholder to veto political contributions made by the board, unless this is in the articles of incorporation.<ref>cf the United Kingdom [[Companies Act 2006]] ss 366\u2013368 and 378</ref> One of the most contentious issues is the right for shareholders to have a \"[[say on pay]]\" of directors. As executive pay has grown beyond inflation, while average worker wages remained stagnant, this was seen important enough to regulate in the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010 \u00a7951. This provision, however, simply introduced a non-binding vote for shareholders, though better rights can always be introduced in the articles of incorporation. While some [[institutional shareholders]], particularly [[pension funds]], have been active in using shareholder rights, [[asset managers]] regulated by the [[Investment Advisers Act]] of 1940 have tended to be mute in opposing corporate boards, as they are often themselves disconnected from the people whose money they are voting upon.\n\n===Investor rights===\n{{see also|Institutional investor|Pension fund|401(k)|Investment manager}}\nMost state corporate laws require shareholders have governance rights against [[boards of directors]], but fewer states guarantee governance rights to the real investors of capital. Currently [[investment managers]] control most voting rights in the economy using \"[[Principal\u2013agent problem|other people's money]]\".<ref>See earlier, [[LD Brandeis]], ''[[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It]]'' ([http://louisville.edu/law/library/special-collections/the-louis-d.-brandeis-collection/other-peoples-money-by-louis-d.-brandeis 1914]) an JS Taub, 'Able but Not Willing: The Failure of Mutual Fund Advisers to Advocate for Shareholders' Rights' (2009) 34(3) The Journal of Corporation Law 843, 876</ref> [[Investment management]] firms, such as [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]], [[Fidelity Investments|Fidelity]], [[Morgan Stanley]] or [[BlackRock]], are often delegated the task of trading fund assets from three main types of institutional investors: [[pension funds]], [[life insurance]] companies, and [[mutual funds]].<ref>See AA Berle, Property, Production and Revolution (1965) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1120512 65 Columbia Law Review 1]</ref> These are usually substitutes to save for retirement. Pensions are most important kind, but can be organized through different legal forms. Investment managers, who are subject to the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]], are then often delegated the task of investment management. Over time, investment managers have also vote on corporate shares, assisted by a \"proxy advice\" firm such as [[Institutional Shareholder Services|ISS]] or [[Glass Lewis]]. Under [[ERISA 1974]] \u00a71102(a),<ref>[[ERISA 1974]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1102&num=0&edition=prelim 29 USC \u00a71102]</ref> a plan must merely have named fiduciaries who have \"authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan\", selected by \"an employer or employee organization\" or both jointly. Usually these [[fiduciaries]] or [[trustees]], will delegate management to a professional firm, particularly because under \u00a71105(d), if they do so, they will not be liable for an investment manager's breaches of duty.<ref>[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1105&num=0&edition=prelim \u00a71105(d)]</ref> These investment managers buy a range of assets (e.g. [[government bonds]], [[corporate bonds]], [[commodities]], real estate or [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s) but particularly [[corporate stocks]] which have voting rights.\n\nThe largest form of retirement fund has become the [[401(k)]] [[defined contribution]] scheme. This is often an individual account that an employer sets up, named after the [[Internal Revenue Code]] \u00a7[[401(k)]], which allows employers and employees to defer tax on money that is saved in the fund until an employee retires.<ref>[[26 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section401&num=0&edition=prelim \u00a7401(k)]</ref> The individual invariably loses any voice over how shareholder voting rights that their money buys will be exercised.<ref>JS Taub, 'Able but Not Willing: The Failure of Mutual Fund Advisers to Advocate for Shareholders' Rights' (2009) 34(3) The Journal of Corporation Law 843, 876</ref> Investment management firms, that are regulated by the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]], the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] and [[ERISA 1974]], will almost always take shareholder voting rights. By contrast, larger and collective pension funds, many still [[defined benefit]] schemes such as [[CalPERS]] or [[TIAA]], organize to take voting in house, or to instruct their investment managers. Two main types of pension fund to do this are labor union organized [[Taft-Hartley plan]]s,<ref>[[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]], [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section186&num=0&edition=prelim \u00a7186(c)(5)(B)]</ref> and [[Public employee pension plans in the United States|state public pension plans]].

[[Public employee pension plans in the United States|State public pensions]] are often larger, and have greater [[bargaining power]] to use on their members' behalf. State pension schemes usually disclose the way trustees are selected. In 2005, on average more than a third of trustees were elected by employees or beneficiaries.<ref>See D Hess, 'Protecting and Politicizing Public Pension Fund Assets: Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Governance Structures and Practices' (2005\u20132006) 39 UC Davis LR 187, 195.

First, rules can restrain or empower the directors in whose favor they exercise their discretion. While older corporate law judgments suggested directors had to promote \"[[shareholder value]]\", most modern state laws empower directors to exercise their own \"[[business judgment]]\" in the way they balance the claims of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Second, all state laws follow the historical pattern of [[fiduciary duties]] to require that directors avoid [[conflicts of interest]] between their own pursuit of profit, and the interests of the corporation. The exact standard, however, may be more or less strict. Third, many states require some kind of basic duty of care in performance of a director's tasks, just as minimum standards of care apply in any [[contract for services]]. However, Delaware has increasingly abandoned substantive objective duties, as it reinterpreted the content of the duty of care, allows liability waivers.\n\n===Stakeholder interests===\n{{main|Stakeholder theory|Corporate social responsibility|Shareholder value}}\n[[File:ARI at CHC 07-15-12 027.JPG|thumb|left|Most states follow the approach in ''[[Shlensky v Wrigley]]'',<ref name=\"237 N.E. 2d 776 Ill. App. 1968\">237 NE 2d 776 (Ill App 1968)</ref> that directors do not only need to maximize shareholder profits. They can balance the interests of all stakeholders, as in a decision to not put in floodlights to play nighttime baseball games, in the community's interest.]] \nMost corporate laws empower directors, as part of their management functions, to determine which strategies will promote a corporation's success in the interests of all stakeholders. Directors will periodically decide whether and how much of a corporation's [[revenue]] should be shared among directors' own pay, the pay for employees (e.g. whether to increase or not next financial year), the [[dividend]]s or other returns to shareholders, whether to lower or raise prices for consumers, whether to retain and reinvest earnings in the business, or whether to make charitable and other donations. Most states have enacted \"[[constituency statute]]s\",<ref>28 states in 1991. See C Hansen, 'Other Constituency Statutes: A Search for Perspective' (1991) 46(4) The Business Lawyer 1355, Appendix A for a list of laws. The Connecticut General Statute Ann. \u00a733-756 goes further than most in requiring directors take account of stakeholders.</ref> which state expressly that directors are empowered to balance the interests of all stakeholders in the way that their conscience, or [[good faith]] decisions would dictate. This discretion typically applies when making a decision about the distribution of corporate resources among different groups, or in whether to defend against a takeover bid. For example, in ''[[Shlensky v Wrigley]]''<ref name=\"237 N.E. 2d 776 Ill. App. 1968\"/> the president of the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball team was sued by stockholders for allegedly failing to pursue the objective of shareholder [[profit maximization]]. The president had decided the corporation would not install flood lights over the baseball ground that would have allowed games could take place at night, because he wished to ensure baseball games were accessible for families, before children's bed time. The Illinois court held that this decision was sound because even though it could have made more money, the director was entitled to regard the interests of the community as more important. Following a similar logic in ''[[AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow]]'' a New Jersey court held that the directors were entitled to make a charitable donation to [[Princeton University]] on the basis because there was \"no suggestion that it was made indiscriminately or to a pet charity of the corporate directors in furtherance of personal rather than corporate ends.\"<ref>39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953)</ref> So long as the directors could not be said to have conflicting interests, their actions would be sustained.\n\n[[File:Ford 1921.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dodge v Ford Motor Co]]'' notoriously held in 1919 that corporations had to be run \"primarily for the profit of the stockholders\" though most states, and the Supreme Court, have since followed the view that directors must balance all stakeholders' interests.<ref>See [[Lynn Stout]], ''Why We Should Stop Teaching Dodge v. Ford'', 3 Virginia Law and Business Review 163 (2008)</ref>]]\nDelaware's law has also followed the same general logic, even though it has no specific constituency or stakeholder statute.<ref>See ''[[Davis v Louisville Gas and Electric Co]]'', 16 Del Ch 157 (1928) 'the directors are chosen to pass upon such questions and their judgment unless shown to be tainted with fraud is accepted as final. The judgment the directors of the corporation enjoys the benefit of a presumption that it was formed in good faith, and was designed to promote the best interests of the corporation they serve.' See also ''[[Unocal Corp v Mesa Petroleum Co]]'', 493 A2d 946 (Del 1985)</ref> The standard is, however, contested largely among business circles which favor a view that directors should act in the sole interests of [[shareholder value]]. Judicial support for this aim is typically found in a case from Michigan in 1919, called ''[[Dodge v Ford Motor Company]]''.<ref>170 NW 668 (Mich 1919)</ref> Here, the [[Ford Motor Company]] president [[Henry Ford]] had publicly announced that he wished not merely to maximize shareholder returns but to raise employee wages, decrease the price of cars for consumers, because he wished, as he put it, \"to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number\". A group of shareholders sued, and the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] said in an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' that a \"business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end.\" However, in the case itself a damages claim against Ford did not succeed, and since then Michigan law has been changed.<ref>[[Michigan Business Corporation Act]] [http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28zvxq5i55n3aif145tywic155%29%29/printDocument.aspx?objectName=mcl-Act-284-of-1972&version=txt \u00a7\u00a7251 and 541a(1)(c)], and see ''[[Churella v Pioneer State Mutual Insurance Co]]'', 671 NW2d 125 (2003) distinguishing ''Dodge''.</ref> The US Supreme Court has also made it clear in ''[[Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc]]'' that shareholder value is not a default or overriding aim of corporate law,<ref>573 U.S. ___ (2014) at page 23, \"While it is certainly true that a central objective of for- profit corporations is to make money, modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives.\"</ref> unless a corporation's rules expressly opt to define such an objective. In practice, many corporations do operate for the benefit of shareholders, but this is less because of duties, and more because shareholders typically exercise a monopoly on the control rights over electing the board. This assumes, however, that directors do not merely use their office to further their own personal goals over the interests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.\n\n===Conflicts of interest===\n{{main|Conflict of interest|Corporate opportunity|Self-dealing}}\nSince the earliest corporations were formed, courts have imposed minimum standards to prevent directors using their office to pursue their own interests over the interests of the corporation. Directors can have no [[conflict of interest]]. In [[trusts law]], this core [[fiduciary duty]] was formulated after the collapse of the [[South Sea Company]] in 1719 in the United Kingdom. ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' held that people in fiduciary positions had to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, and this rule \"should be strictly pursued\".<ref>[1726] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1726/J76.html EWHC Ch J76]</ref> It was later held that no inquiry should be made into transactions where the fiduciary was interested in [[Self-dealing|both sides of the deal]].<ref>See ''[[Whelpdale v Cookson]]'' (1747) 27 ER 856</ref> These principles of equity were received into the law of the United States, and in a modern formulation [[Cardozo J]] said in ''[[Meinhard v Salmon]]'' that the law required \"the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive ... at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\"<ref>164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928)</ref>\n\nThe standards applicable to directors, however, began to depart significantly from traditional principles of equity that required \"no possibility\" of conflict regarding [[corporate opportunities]], and \"no inquiry\" into the actual terms of transactions if tainted by [[self-dealing]]. In a Delaware decision from 1939, ''[[Guth v Loft Inc]]'',<ref>5 A2d 503 (Del 1939)</ref> it was held that [[Charles Guth]], the president of a drink manufacturer named [[Loft Inc.]], had breached his duty to avoid conflicts of interest by purchasing the [[Pepsi company]] and its syrup recipe in his own name, rather than offering it to Loft Inc. However, although the duty was breached, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the court will look at the particular circumstances, and will not regard a conflict as existing if the company it lacked finances to take the opportunity, if it is not in the same line of business, or did not have an \"interest or reasonable expectancy\". More recently, in ''[[Broz v Cellular Information Systems Inc]]'',<ref name=\"637 A2d 148 Del Supr 1996\">637 A2d 148 (Del Supr 1996)</ref> it was held that a non-executive director of CIS Inc, a man named Mr Broz, had not breached his duty when he bought telecommunications licenses for the Michigan area for his own company, [[RFB Cellular Inc.]]. CIS Inc had been shedding licenses at the time, and so Broz alleged that he thought there was no need to inquire whether CIS Inc would be interested. CIS Inc was then taken over, and the new owners pushed for the claim to be brought. The Delaware Supreme Court held that because CIS Inc had not been financially capable at the time to buy licenses, and so there was no actual conflict of interest. In order to be sure, or at least avoid litigation, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] \u00a7144 provides that directors cannot be liable, and a transaction cannot be voidable if it was (1) approved by disinterested directors after full disclosure (2) approved by shareholders after disclosure, or (3) approved by a court as fair.<ref>See also the Revised [[Model Business Corporation Act]] \u00a78.61 and California Corporation Code \u00a7310</ref>\n\n*''[[Miller v Miller]]'', 222 NW.2d 71 (1974)\nCorporate officers and directors may pursue business transactions that benefit themselves as long as they can prove the transaction, although self-interested, was nevertheless intrinsically \"fair\" to the corporation. \n*''[[Lieberman v Becker]]'', 38 Del Ch 540, 155 A 2d 596 (Super Ct 1959)\n*DGCL \u00a7144 contains the rule that the burden for proving unfairness remains on plaintiff after disclosure\n*''[[Flieger v Lawrence]]'', 361 A2d 218 (Del 1976) the burden of proof shifts onto the plaintiff to show a transaction was conflicted if approval by disinterested stockholders or directors has been given to a transaction. Also ''[[Remillard Brick Co v Remillard-Dandini Co]]'', 109 Cal App2d 405 (1952)\n*''[[Oberly v Kirby]]'', 592 A2d 445, 467 (Del 1991)\n*''[[Cinerama Inc v Technicolor Inc]]'', 663 A2d 1156, 1170 (Del. 1995)\n*''[[Benihana of Tokyo Inc v Benihana Inc.]]'', 906 A2d 114 (Del. 2006)\n\n===Duty of care===\n{{Main|Duty of care}}\n[[File:New York Stock Exchange NYC.JPG|thumb|right|In ''[[Ultramares Corporation v Touche]]'',<ref>174 NE 441 (1932)</ref> a case concerning Touche, Niven & Company (now [[Deloitte]]) across from the [[NYSE]],<ref>At [[30 Broad Street]], New York City.</ref> [[Cardozo CJ]] held that the ordinary duty of care applicable to professionals performing services requires people to act \"with the care and caution proper to their calling\".]]\nThe [[duty of care]] that is owed by all people performing services for others is, in principle, also applicable to directors of corporations. Generally speaking, the duty of care requires an objective standard of diligence and skill when people perform services, which could be expected from a reasonable person in a similar position (e.g. auditors must act \"with the care and caution proper to their calling\",<ref>See ''[[Ultramares Corporation v Touche]]'', 174 N.E. 441 (1932)</ref> and builders must perform their work in line with \"industry standards\"<ref>See ''[[Terlinde v Neely]]'', 275 SC 395, 271 SE2d 768 (1980)</ref>). In a 1742 decision of the English [[Court of Chancery]], ''[[The Charitable Corporation v Sutton]]'',<ref>(1742) 26 ER 642</ref> the directors of the [[Charitable Corporation]], which gave out small loans to the needy, were held liable for failing to keep procedures in place that would have prevented three officers defrauding the corporation of a vast sum of money. [[Lord Hardwicke]], noting that a director's office was of a \"mixed nature\", partly \"of the nature of a public office\" and partly like \"agents\" employed in \"trust\", held that the directors were liable. Though they were not to be judged with [[hindsight]], Lord Hardwicke said he could \"never determine that frauds of this kind are out of the reach of courts of law or equity, for an intolerable grievance would follow from such a determination.\" Many states have similarly maintained an objective baseline duty of care for corporate directors, while acknowledging different levels of care can be expected from directors of small or large corporations, and from directors with executive or non-executive roles on the board.<ref>e.g. ''[[Barnes v Andrews]]'', 298 F 614 (SDNY 1924) A director of the [[Liberty Starter Co]], now insolvent, was accused of having contributed to the failure by being inattentive on the board. Acknowledging the duty of care, but distinguishing on these facts, [[Learned Hand J]] held, \"It is easy to say he should have done something, but that will not serve to harness upon him the whole loss, nor is it the equivalent of saying that, had he acted, the company would now flourish. An inattentive director or directors cannot be held liable for a corporate loss if it is shown that proper attentiveness to corporate affairs by all the directors would still not have prevented the loss complained of. In order words, it must be demonstrated that the accused director's slothfulness was a cause of the company's loss. This notion of causation is thus a critical element in any action brought against a poorly performing board of directors and has had a tremendous impact on the course of modern corporate governance.\"</ref> However, in Delaware, as in a number of other states,<ref>e.g. Indiana Code Ann \u00a723-1-35(1)(e)(2) requires willful misconduct or recklessness before any liability. c.f. [[Model Business Corporation Act]] \u00a78.30(a) which requires a director act in good faith and what he or she reasonably believes to be in the company's best interests.</ref> the existence of a duty of care has become increasingly uncertain.\n\n[[File:Flickr - paul bica - LA morning.jpg|thumb|left|''[[In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation]]''<ref name=\"964 A 2d 106 Del Ch 2009\">964 A 2d 106 (Del Ch 2009)</ref> ensured that no director of any major banking corporation could be held liable for breach of the [[duty of care]], even though its risky practices caused the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref>See further, JC Coffee, 'What went wrong? An initial inquiry into the causes of the 2008 financial crisis' (2009) 9(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 1</ref>]]\nIn 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court passed one of its most debated judgments, ''[[Smith v Van Gorkom]]''.<ref>488 A2d 858 (Sup Ct Del 1985) Before this, the leading case was ''[[Graham v Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co]]'', 188 A2d 125 (Del Supr 1963)</ref> The directors of [[TransUnion]], including [[Jerome W. Van Gorkom]], were sued by the shareholders for failing to adequately research the corporation's value, before approving a sale price of $55 per share to the [[Marmon Group]]. The Court held that to be a protected business judgment, \"the directors of a corporation [must have] acted on an [[Informed consent|informed basis]], in [[good faith]] and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.\" Failing to act on an informed basis, if it caused loss, would amount to [[gross negligence]], and here the directors were liable. The decision triggered a panic among corporate boards which believed they would be exposed to massive liability, and insurance firms who feared rising costs of providing [[directors and officers liability insurance]] to corporate boards. In response to lobbying, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] was amended to insert a new \u00a7102(b)(7). This allowed corporations to give directors immunity from liability for breach of the duty of care in their charter. However, for those corporations which did not introduce liability waivers, the courts subsequently proceeded to reduce the duty of care outright.<ref>See also ''[[Cinerama Inc v Technicolor, Inc]]'', 663 A.2d 1156 (1995) directors proved the 'entire fairness' of a merger, selling to MacAndrews & Forbes Group, even though directors failed to conduct an adequate market check to determine if other bidders would have given a higher price. ''Van Gorkom'' was distinguished.</ref> In 1996, ''[[In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation]]''<ref>698 A 2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996)</ref> required \"an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists\", and in 2003 ''[[In re Walt Disney Derivative Litigation]]''<ref>825 A 2d 275 (2003)</ref> went further. [[Chancellor Chandler]] held directors could only be liable for showing \"reckless indifference to or a deliberate disregard of the whole body of stockholders\" through actions that are \"without the bounds of reason\".<ref>See also, ''[[Brehm v Eisner]]'', 746 A.2d 244 (2000) Del Supreme Court, \"Due care in the decisionmaking context is process due care only. Irrationality is the outer limit of the business judgment rule. Irrationality may be the functional equivalent of the waste test or it may tend to show that the decision is not made in good faith, which is a key ingredient of the business judgment rule.\"</ref> In one of the cases that came out of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], the same line of reasoning was deployed in ''[[In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation]]''.<ref name=\"964 A 2d 106 Del Ch 2009\"/> [[Chancellor Chandler]], confirming his previous opinions in ''Re Walt Disney'' and the ''dicta'' of ''Re Caremark'', held that the directors of [[Citigroup]] could not be liable for failing to have a warning system in place to guard against potential losses from [[sub-prime mortgage debt]]. Although there had been several indications of the significant risks, and Citigroup's practices along with its competitors were argued to have contributed to crashing the international economy, Chancellor Chandler held that \"plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove bad faith conduct by the director defendants\". This suggested that Delaware law had effectively negated any substantive duty of care. This suggested that corporate directors were exempt from duties that any other professional performing services would owe. It remained unclear, with a change in the Chief Justice of the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] in 2014, whether this position would remain.\n\n===Derivative suits===\n{{main|Derivative suit}}\n{{Slist derivative suit}}\nBecause directors owe their duties to the corporation and not, as a general rule, to specific shareholders or stakeholders, the right to sue for breaches of directors duty rests by default with the corporation itself. The corporation is necessarily party to the suit.<ref>See generally ''[[Davenport v Dows]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|85|626|1873}} and ''[[Ross v Bernhard]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|396|531|1970}}</ref> This creates a difficulty because almost always, the right to litigate falls under the general powers of directors to manage the corporation day to day (e.g. [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] \u00a7141(a)). Often, cases arise (such as in ''[[Broz v Cellular Information Systems Inc]]''<ref name=\"637 A2d 148 Del Supr 1996\"/>) where an action is brought against a director because the corporation has been taken over and a new, non-friendly board is in place, or because the board has been replaced after bankruptcy. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a conflict of interest because directors will be reluctant to sue their colleagues, particularly when they develop personal ties. The law has sought to define further cases where groups other than directors can sue for breaches of duty. First, many jurisdictions outside the US allow a specific percentage of shareholders to bring a claim as of right (e.g. 1 per cent).<ref>e.g., the German [[Aktiengesetz]] 1965 [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aktg/__148.html \u00a7148]</ref> This solution may still entail significant [[collective action problems]] where shareholders are dispersed, like the US. Second, some jurisdictions give standing to sue to non-shareholder groups, particularly creditors, whose collective action problems are less.<ref>e.g. ''[[BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders]]'' [2008] [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc69/2008scc69.html 3 SCR 560]</ref> Otherwise, third, the main alternative is that any individual shareholder may \"derive\" a claim on the corporation's behalf to sue for breach of duty, but such a derivative suit will be subject to permission from the court.\n\n[[File:Larry Ellison in Oracle OpenWorld 2010.JPG|thumb|left|Increasingly courts have denied that the board should restrict derivative suits, as in the 2003 case ''[[In re Oracle Corp Derivative Litigation]]''<ref>824 A.2d 917 (2003)</ref> where it was held that an [[insider trading]] claim against [[Oracle Corp]] CEO [[Larry Ellison]] could proceed.<ref>The case was subsequently settled.

Accordingly, it is generally thought that oversight by the court is justified to ensure derivative suits match the corporation's interests as a whole because courts may be more independent. However, especially from the 1970s some states, and especially Delaware, began also to require that the board have a role. Most [[common law]] jurisdictions have abandoned role for the board in derivative claims,<ref>See for example, the UK [[Companies Act 2006]] ss [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/11 261\u2013263]</ref> and in most US states before the 1980s, the board's role was no more than a formality.<ref>See RM Buxbaum, 'Conflict-of-Interest Statutes and the Need for a Demand on Directors in Derivative Actions' (1980) 68 Californian Law Review 1122</ref> But then, a formal role for the board was reintroduced. In the procedure to bring a derivative suit, the first step is often that the shareholder had to make a \"demand\" on the board to bring a claim.<ref>Delaware Chancery Court Rules, Rule 23.1, requires exhaustion of internal remedies.</ref> Although it might appear strange to ask a group of directors who will be sued, or whose colleagues are being sued, for permission, Delaware courts took the view that the decision to litigate ought by default to lie within the legitimate scope of directors' business judgment. For example, in ''[[Aronson v Lewis]]''<ref>473 A 2d 805, 812 (Del 1984)</ref> a shareholder of the Meyers Parking System Inc claimed that the board had improperly wasted corporate assets by giving its 75-year-old director, Mr Fink, a large salary and bonus for consultancy work even though the contract did not require performance of any work. Mr Fink had also personally selected all of the directors. Nevertheless, [[Andrew G. T. Moore II|Moore J.]] held for the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] that there was still a requirement to make a demand on the board before a derivative suit could be brought. There was \"a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was taken in the best interests of the company\", even if they owed their jobs to the person being sued. A requirement to make a demand on the board will, however, be excused if it is shown that it would be entirely \"futile\", primarily because a majority of the board is alleged to have breached its duty. Otherwise it must be shown that all board members are in some very strong sense conflicted, but merely working with the accused directors, and the personal ties this potentially creates, is insufficient for some courts.<ref>e.g. in New York, see ''[[Barr v Wackman]]'' 329 NE.2d 180 (1975) and ''[[In re Kaufmann Mutual Fund Actions]]'', 479 F.2d 257 (1973) cert denied 414 US 857 (1973)</ref> This indicated a significant and controversial change in Delaware's judicial policy, that prevented claims against boards.\n\n[[File:1981 US Cabinet.jpg|right|thumb|In 1981, in ''[[Zapata Corp v Maldonado]]''<ref name=\"430 A 2d 779 Del Sup 1981\">430 A 2d 779 (Del Sup 1981)</ref> the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of [[Zapata Corp.]], founded by [[George H.W. Bush]], could not be sued for breach of fiduciary duty. An \"independent investigation committee\" was competent to reject the demand for a derivative suit, despite being appointed by the board.]]\nIn some cases corporate boards attempted to establish \"independent litigation committees\" to evaluate whether a shareholder's demand to bring a suit was justified. This strategy was used to pre-empt criticism that the board was conflicted. The directors would appoint the members of the \"independent committee\", which would then typically deliberate and come to the conclusion that there was no good cause for bringing litigation. In ''[[Zapata Corp v Maldonado]]''<ref name=\"430 A 2d 779 Del Sup 1981\"/> the Delaware Supreme Court held that if the committee acted in good faith and showed reasonable grounds for its conclusion, and the court could be \"satisfied [about] other reasons relating to the process\", the committee's decision to not allow a claim could not be overturned. Applying Connecticut law, the [[Second Circuit Federal Court of Appeals]] held in ''[[Joy v North]]''<ref>692 F.2d 880 (1982)</ref> that the court could substitute its judgment for the decisions of a supposedly independent committee, and the board, on the ground that there was scope for conflicting interests. Then, the substantive merits for bringing the derivative claim would be assessed. [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.|Winter J]] held overall that shareholders would have the burden \"to demonstrate that the action is more likely than not to be against the interests of the corporation\". This would entail a cost benefit analysis. On the benefit side would be \"the likely recoverable damages discounted by the probability of a finding of liability\", and the costs side would include \"attorney's fees and other out-of-pocket expenses\", \"time spent by corporate personnel\", \"the impact of distraction of key personnel\", and potential lost profits which may result from the publicity of a trial.\" If it is thought that the costs exceed the benefits, then the shareholders acquire the right to sue on the corporation's behalf. A substantive hearing on the merits about the alleged breach of director's duty may be heard. The tendency in Delaware, however, has remained to allow the board to play a role in restricting litigation, and therefore minimize the chances that it could be held accountable for basic breaches of duty.<ref>c.f. more recently, ''[[In re Oracle Corp Derivative Litigation]]'', 824 A.2d 917 (2003) concerning [[insider trading]], approving a derivative claim on the basis of the director's personal ties.</ref>\n\n==Minority shareholder protections==\n{{see also|Oppression remedy|Unfair prejudice}}\n*''[[Ivanhoe Partners v Newmont Mining Corp.]]'', 535 A.2d 1334 (Del. 1987) a shareholder owning over 50% of shares is a controlling shareholder; but actual control may also be present through other mechanisms\n*''[[Citron v Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp.]]'', 569 A.2d 53, 70 (Del. 1989) non-controlling shareholders do not owe duties to minority shareholders and may vote their shares for personal gain without concern\n*''[[In re Cysive, Inc.

The [[US Constitution]] was interpreted by the [[US Supreme Court]] to allow corporations to incorporate in the state of their choice, regardless of where their headquarters are.

Since the world's first [[stock market crash]] (the [[South Sea Bubble]] of 1720) corporations were perceived as dangerous. This was because, as the economist [[Adam Smith]] wrote in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), directors managed \"other people's money\" and this [[conflict of interest]] meant directors were prone to \"[[negligence]] and [[profusion]]\". Corporations were only thought to be legitimate in specific industries (such as [[Insurance in the United States|insurance]] or [[Banking in the United States|banking]]) that could not be managed efficiently through partnerships.<ref>cf [[Adam Smith|A Smith]], ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/119#Smith_0206-02_591 Book V, ch 1, \u00a7107]</ref> After the [[US Constitution]] was ratified in 1788, corporations were still distrusted, and were tied into debate about interstate exercise of sovereign power. The [[First Bank of the United States]] was chartered in 1791 by the [[US Congress]] to raise money for the government and create a common currency (alongside a [[Excise tax in the United States|federal excise tax]] and the [[US Mint]]). It had private investors (not government owned), but faced opposition from southern politicians who feared federal power overtaking state power. So, the First Bank's charter was written to expire in 20 years. State governments could and did also incorporate corporations through special legislation. In 1811, New York became the first state to have a simple public registration procedure to start corporations (not specific permission from the legislature) for manufacturing business.<ref>[[Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811]]</ref> It also allowed investors to have [[limited liability]], so that if the enterprise went bankrupt investors would lose their investment, but not any extra debts that had been run up to creditors. An early [[US Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward]]'',<ref name=\"ussc|periods=no|17|518|1819\">{{ussc|periods=no|17|518|1819}}</ref> went so far as to say that once a corporation was established a state legislature (in this case, New Hampshire) could not amend it. States quickly reacted by reserving the right to regulate future dealings by corporations.<ref>cf William A. Klein and [[John C.

Corporations were the subject of legal rights and duties: they could make contracts, hold [[property]] or commission [[torts]],<ref>See ''[[Louisville C&CR Co v Letson]]'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), a corporation is \"capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.\" ''[[Marshall v Baltimore & Ohio Railway Co]]'', 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854) \"those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,\" should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation.</ref> but there was no necessary requirement to treat a corporation as favorably as a real person.\n\n[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Bosses of the Senate\", corporate interests\u2013from steel, copper, oil, iron, sugar, tin, and coal to paper bags, envelopes, and salt\u2013as giant money bags looming over senators.<ref>[[Joseph Ferdinand Keppler|Joseph Keppler]], ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' (January 23, 1889)</ref>]]\nOver the late 19th century, more and more states allowed free incorporation of businesses with a simple registration procedure.<ref>See M Dodd, ''American Business Association Law a Hundred Years Ago and Today'' in ''Law: A Century of Progress: 1835\u20131935'' (Reppy 1937) 254 and Lawrence M.

However, the dominant trend led towards immense corporate groups where the standard rule was [[one-share, one-vote]]. At the end of the 19th century, \"[[Trust law|trust]]\" systems (where formal ownership had to be used for another person's benefit) were used to concentrate control into the hands of a few people, or a single person. In response, the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890 was created to break up big business conglomerates, and the [[Clayton Act]] of 1914 gave the government power to halt [[mergers and acquisitions]] that could damage the public interest. By the end of the [[First World War]], it was increasingly perceived that ordinary people had little voice compared to the \"financial oligarchy\" of bankers and industrial magnates.<ref>See [[L Brandeis]], ''[[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It]]'' (1914)</ref> In particular, employees lacked voice compared to shareholders, but plans for a post-war \"[[industrial democracy]]\" (giving employees votes for investing their labor) did not become widespread.<ref>The Massachusetts governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] passed \"An Act to enable manufacturing corporations to provide for the representation of their employees on the board of directors\" (April 3, 1919) Chap. 0070. This was a measure that allowed corporations to voluntarily give workers votes. It remains in the Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, \u00a723</ref> Through the 1920s, power concentrated in fewer hands as corporations issued shares with multiple voting rights, while other shares were sold with no votes at all. This practice was halted in 1926 by public pressure and the [[New York Stock Exchange]] refusing to list non-voting shares.<ref>See [[William Z. Ripley]], ''Wall Street and Main Street'' (1927). The practice began again in 1986.</ref> It was possible to sell voteless shares in the economic boom of the 1920s, because more and more ordinary people were looking to the stock market to save the new money they were earning, but the law did not guarantee good information or fair terms. New shareholders had [[Inequality of bargaining power|no power to bargain]] against large corporate issuers, but still needed a place to save. Before the [[Wall Street Crash]] of 1929, people were being sold shares in corporations with fake businesses, as accounts and business reports were not made available to the investing public.\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=24em|salign=right|quote=over the enterprise and over the physical property \u2013 the instruments of production \u2013 in which he has an interest, the [[Shareholder|owner]] has little control. At the same time he bears no responsibility with respect to the enterprise or its physical property. It has often been said that the owner of a horse is responsible. If the horse lives he must feed it. If the horse dies he must bury it. No such responsibility attaches to a share of stock. The owner is practically powerless through his own efforts to affect the underlying [[property]] ... Physical property capable of being shaped by its owner could bring to him direct satisfaction apart from the income it yielded in more concrete form. It represented an extension of his own personality. With the corporate revolution, this quality has been lost to the property owner much as it has been lost to the worker through the [[industrial revolution]].|source= \u2014[[AA Berle]] and [[GC Means]], ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932) Book I, ch IV, 64}}\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash]] saw the total collapse of stock market values, as shareholders realized that corporations had become overpriced. They sold shares ''en masse'', meaning meant companies found it hard to get finance. The result was that thousands of businesses were forced to close, and they laid off workers. Because workers had less money to spend, businesses received less income, leading to more closures and lay-offs. This downward spiral began the [[Great Depression]]. Berle and Means argued that under-regulation was the primary cause in their foundational book in 1932, ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]''. They said directors had become too unaccountable, and the markets lacked basic transparency rules. This led directly to the [[New Deal]] reforms of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]]. A new [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] was empowered to require corporations disclose all material information about their business to the investing public. Because many shareholders were physically distant from corporate headquarters where meetings would take place, new rights were made to allow people to cast votes via proxies, on the view that this and other measures would make directors more accountable. Given these reforms, a major controversy still remained about the duties that corporations also owed to employees, other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, and the rest of society.<ref>[[AA Berle]], 'Corporate Powers As Powers in Trust' (1931) 44 Harvard Law Review 1049, [[EM Dodd]], 'For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?' (1932) 45 Harvard Law Review 1145 and [[AA Berle]], 'For Whom Corporate Managers Are Trustees: A Note' (1932) 45 Harvard Law Review 1365</ref> After [[World War II]], a general consensus emerged that directors were not bound purely to pursue \"[[shareholder value]]\" but could exercise their discretion for the good of all stakeholders, for instance by increasing wages instead of dividends, or providing services for the good of the community instead of only pursuing profits, if it was in the interests of the enterprise as a whole.<ref>e.g. ''[[AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow]]'', 13 N.J. 145, 98 A.2d 581, 39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953) and ''[[Shlensky v Wrigley]]'', 237 N.E. 2d 776 (Ill. App. 1968)</ref> However, different states had different corporate laws. To increase revenue from [[corporate tax]], individual states had an incentive to lower their standards in a \"[[race to the bottom]]\" to attract corporations to set up their headquarters in the state, particularly where directors controlled the decision to incorporate. \"[[Charter competition]]\", by the 1960s, had led Delaware to become home to the majority of the largest US corporations. This meant that the case law of the [[Delaware Chancery Court|Delaware Chancery]] and [[Delaware Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] became increasingly influential. During the 1980s, a huge takeover and merger boom decreased directors' accountability. To fend off a takeover, courts allowed boards to institute \"[[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]]s\" or \"[[shareholder rights plan]]s\", which allowed directors to veto any bid \u2013 and probably get a payout for letting a takeover happen. More and more people's retirement savings were being invested into the stock market, through [[pension fund]]s, [[life insurance]] and [[mutual funds]]. This resulted in a vast growth in the [[asset management]] industry, which tended to take control of voting rights. Both the financial sector's share of income, and executive pay for chief executive officers began to rise far beyond real wages for the rest of the workforce. The [[Enron scandal]] of 2001 led to some reforms in the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (on separating auditors from consultancy work). The [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] of 2007 led to minor changes in the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] (on soft regulation of pay, alongside [[derivative]] markets). However, the basic shape of corporate law in the United States has remained the same since the 1980s.\n\n==Corporations and civil law==\n{{see also|UK company law|Canadian corporate law|South African company law|German company law|European company law}}\n[[File:DMB-007-Small.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The state of Delaware is the place of incorporation for over 60 per cent of [[Fortune 500]] corporations.<ref>See [http://corplaw.delaware.gov/eng/why_delaware.shtml corplaw.delaware.gov].</ref> In 1999, from 6,530 publicly traded nonfinancial firms in the US, 3,771 (57.75%) were incorporated in Delaware, 283 (4.33%) in California, and 226 (3.46%) in New York.<ref>See L Bebchuk, A Cohen and A Ferrell, ''Does the Evidence Favor State Competition in Corporate Law?'' [http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/corp_gov/papers/No352.02.Bebchuk-Cohen-Ferrell.pdf 90 California LR 1775], 1809\u20131810 (2002)</ref>]]\nCorporations are invariably classified as \"[[legal persons]]\" by all modern systems of law, meaning that like [[natural person]]s, they may acquire rights and duties. A corporation may be chartered in any of the 50 states (or the District of Columbia) and may become authorized to do business in each jurisdiction it does business within, except that when a corporation sues or is sued over a contract, the court, regardless of where the corporation's headquarters office is located, or where the transaction occurred, will use the law of the jurisdiction where the corporation was chartered (unless the contract says otherwise). So, for example, consider a corporation which sets up a concert in Hawaii, where its headquarters are in Minnesota, and it is chartered in Colorado, if it is sued over its actions involving the concert, whether it was sued in Hawaii (where the concert is located), or Minnesota (where its headquarters are located), the court in that state will still use Colorado law to determine how its corporate dealings are to be performed.\n\nAll major public corporations are also characterized by holding [[limited liability]] and having a centralized management.<ref>c.f. [[RC Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' (Aspen 1986) 2, who defines the modern public corporation by four main features: separate legal personality, limited liability, centralized management, and freely transferable shares.</ref> When a group of people go through the procedures to incorporate, they will acquire rights to make [[United States contract law|contracts]], to possess [[property]], to sue, and they will also be responsible for [[United States tort law|tort]]s, or other wrongs, and be sued. The federal government does not charter corporations (except National Banks, Federal Savings Banks, and Federal Credit Unions) although it does regulate them. Each of the 50 states plus DC has its own corporation law. Most large corporations have historically chosen to incorporate in Delaware, even though they operate nationally, and may have little or no business in Delaware itself. The extent to which corporations should have the same rights as real people is controversial, particularly when it comes to the [[fundamental rights]] found in the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. As a matter of law, a corporation acts through real people that form its board of directors, and then through the officers and employees who are appointed on its behalf. Shareholders can in some cases make decisions on the corporation's behalf, though in larger companies they tend to be passive. Otherwise, most corporations adopt [[limited liability]] so that generally shareholders cannot be sued for a corporation's commercial debts. If a corporation goes bankrupt, and is unable to pay debts to commercial creditors as they fall due, then in some circumstances state courts allow the so-called \"veil of incorporation\" to be pierced, and so to hold the people behind the corporation liable. This is usually rare and in almost all cases involves non-payment of [[trust fund tax]]es or willful misconduct, essentially amounting to fraud.\n\n===Incorporation and charter competition===\n{{main|Incorporation (business)|Regulatory competition}}\n{{Slist corporate acts}}\nAlthough every state will have slight differences in their requirements, the process of forming a new corporation is usually quick.<ref>See generally, WA Klein and JC Coffee, ''Business Organization and Finance: Legal and Economic Principles'' (9th edn Foundation 2004) 137\u2013140</ref> A corporation is not the only kind of business organization that can be chosen. People may wish to register a partnership or a [[Limited Liability Company]], depending on the precise [[Partnership taxation in the United States|tax status]] and organizational form that is sought.<ref>See also [[Limited liability limited partnership]]</ref> Most frequently, however, people will choose corporations which have [[limited liability]] for those who become the shareholders: if the corporation goes [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]] the default rule is that shareholders will only lose the money they paid for their shares, even if debts to commercial creditors are still unpaid. A state office, perhaps called the \"Division of Corporations\" or simply the \"Secretary of State\",<ref>e.g. in Delaware see the Division of Corporations at [http://corp.delaware.gov/howtoform.shtml corp.delaware.gov], in New York see the Division of Corporations at [http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/ dos.ny.gov/corps], and in California see the \"Business Entities\" section of the Secretary of State website at [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/ sos.ca.gov/business]</ref> will require the people who wish to incorporate to file \"[[articles of incorporation]]\" (sometimes called a \"charter\") and pay a fee. The articles of incorporation typically record the corporation's name, if there are any limits to its powers, purposes or duration, identify whether all shares will have the same rights. With this information filed with the state, a new corporation will come into existence, and be so be subject to legal rights and duties that the people involved create on its behalf. The incorporators will also have to adopt \"[[bylaws]]\" which identify many more details such as the number of directors, the arrangement of the board, requirements for corporate meetings, duties of officer holders and so on. The certificate of incorporation will have identified whether the directors or the shareholders, or both have the competence to adopt and change these rules. All of this is typically achieved through the corporation's first meeting.\n\n[[File:Corporate Income Tax as a Share of GDP, 1946 - 2009.png|left|thumb|[[Corporate tax in the United States|Corporate income tax]] as a share of GDP, 1946\u20132009.]]\nOne of the most important things that the articles of incorporation determine is the state of incorporation. Different states can have different levels of [[Corporate tax in the United States|corporate tax]] or [[franchise tax]], different qualities of shareholder and stakeholder rights, more or less stringent [[directors' duties]], and so on. However, it was held by the Supreme Court in ''[[Paul v Virginia]]'' that in principle states ought to allow corporations incorporated in a different state to do business freely.<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|75|168|1869}} and see Henry N. Butler, ''Nineteeth century jurisdictional competition in the granting of corporate privileges'' (1985) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/724319 14(1) Journal of Legal Studies 129]</ref> This appeared to remain true even if another state (e.g. Delaware) required significantly worse internal protections for shareholders, employees, creditors than the state in which the corporation operated (e.g. New York). So far, federal regulation has affected more issues relating to the securities markets than the balance of power and duties among directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that one state's laws will govern the \"[[Internal affairs doctrine|internal affairs]]\" of a corporation, to prevent conflicts among state laws.<ref>See ''[[Edgar v MITE Corp]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|457|624|1982}} White J., citing [[Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws]] \u00a7 302, Comment b, pp. 307\u2013308 (1971) Also ''[[VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996 v Examen Inc]]'', 871 A2d 1108, 1113 (2005) 'The internal affairs doctrine applies to those matters that pertain to the relationships among or between the corporation and its officers, directors, and shareholder.'</ref> So on the present law, regardless of where a corporation operates in the 50 states, the rules of the state of incorporation (subject to federal law) will govern its operation.<ref>Contrast the European Union decisions, including ''[[Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd]]'' (2003) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62001J0167:EN:HTML C-167/01] and see [[Simon Deakin]], ''Two Types of Regulatory Competition: Competitive Federalism versus Reflexive Harmonisation.

Over the 20th century, the problem of a \"[[race to the bottom]]\" was increasingly thought to justify Federal regulation of corporations. The contrasting view was that [[regulatory competition]] among states could be beneficial, on the assumption that shareholders would choose to invest their money with corporations that were well governed. Thus the state's corporation regulations would be \"priced\" by efficient markets. In this way it was argued to be a \"race to the top\".<ref>See [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.|RK Winter]], 'State Law, Shareholder Protection, and the Theory of the Corporation' (1977) 6 J Leg Studies 251</ref> An intermediate viewpoint in the academic literature,<ref>This is vast. See K Kocaoglu, 'A Comparative Bibliography: Regulatory Competition on Corporate Law' (2008) Georgetown University Law Center Working Paper, on [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1103644 SSRN]</ref> suggested that regulatory competition could in fact be either positive or negative, and could be used to the advantage of different groups, depending on which stakeholders would exercise most influence in the decision about which state to incorporate in.<ref>e.g. W Bratton, 'Corporate Law's Race to Nowhere in Particular' (1994) 44 U Toronto LJ 401. See also</ref> Under most state laws, directors hold the exclusive power to allow a vote on amending the articles of incorporation, and shareholders must approve directors' proposals by a majority, unless a higher threshold is in the articles.\n\n===Corporate personality===\n{{Slist personality}}\n{{see also|Separate legal personality}}\nIn principle a duly incorporated business acquires \"[[legal personality]]\" that is separate from the people who invest their capital, and their labor, into the corporation. Just as the [[common law]] had for municipal and church corporations for centuries,<ref>e.g. ''[[Case of Sutton's Hospital]]'' (1612) 77 Eng Rep 960</ref> it was held by the Supreme Court in ''[[Bank of the United States v Deveaux]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|9|61|1809}}</ref> that in principle corporations had [[legal capacity]]. At its center, corporations being \"legal persons\" mean they can make contracts and other obligations, hold property, sue to enforce their rights and be sued for breach of duty. Beyond the core of private law rights and duties the question has, however, continually arisen about the extent to which corporations and real people should be treated alike. The meaning of \"person\", when used in a statute or the [[US Bill of Rights]] is typically thought to turn on the construction of the statute, so that in different contexts the legislature or founding fathers could have intended different things by \"person\". For example, in an 1869 case named ''[[Paul v Virginia]]'', the [[US Supreme Court]] held that the word \"citizen\" in the [[privileges and immunities clause]] of the [[US Constitution]] (article IV, section 2) did not include corporations.<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|75|168|1869}}</ref> This meant that the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] was entitled to require that a New York [[fire insurance]] corporation, run by Mr Samuel Paul, acquired a license to sell policies within Virginia, even though there were different rules for corporations incorporated within the state.<ref>The larger consequence was that insurance regulation remained state based, as the Court also held that insurance did not generally affect interstate commerce. This latter ruling was, however, overturned by ''[[United States v South-Eastern Underwriters Association]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|322|533|1944}}</ref> By contrast, in ''[[Santa Clara County v Southern Pacific Railroad Co]]'',<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|118|394|1886}}</ref> a majority of the Supreme Court hinted that a corporation might be regarded as a \"person\" under the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad Company]] had claimed it should not be subject to differential tax treatment, compared to natural persons, set by the [[State Board of Equalization]] acting under the [[Constitution of California]]. However, in the event [[John Marshall Harlan|Harlan J]] held that the company could not be assessed for tax on a technical point: the state county had included too much property in its calculations. Differential treatment between natural persons and corporations was therefore not squarely addressed.\n\n[[File:Supreme Court US 2010.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Citizens United v FEC]]'', the [[US Supreme Court]] in a 5 to 4 decision removed the power of state and federal legislatures to control unlimited spending by corporations on political campaigns, reasoning that corporations are \"persons\" under the [[First Amendment]].<ref name=\"usr|558|310|2010\">{{ussc|periods=no|558|310|2010}}</ref>]]\nIn the late 20th century, however, the issue of whether a corporation counted as a \"person\" for all or some purposes acquired political significance. Initially, in ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|424|1|1976}}</ref> a slight majority of the [[US Supreme Court]] had held that natural persons were entitled to spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their political campaigns. Over a strong dissent, the majority therefore held that parts of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] of 1974 were unconstitutional since spending money was, in the majority's view, a manifestation of the right to [[freedom of speech]] under the [[First Amendment]]. This did not affect corporations, though the issue arose in ''[[Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce]]''.<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|494|652|1990}}</ref> A differently constituted [[US Supreme Court]] held, with three dissents, that the Michigan Campaign Finance Act could, compatibly with the First Amendment, prohibit political spending by corporations. However, by 2010, the Supreme Court had a different majority. In a five to four decision, ''[[Citizens United v Federal Election Commission]]''<ref name=\"usr|558|310|2010\"/> held that corporations were persons that should be protected in the same was as natural people under the First Amendment, and so they were entitled to spend unlimited amounts of money in donations to political campaigns. This struck down the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002, so that an anti-[[Hillary Clinton]] advertisement (\"[[Hillary: The Movie]]\") could be run by a pro-business lobby group. Subsequently, the same Supreme Court majority decided in 2014, in ''[[Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc]]''<ref>573 US ___ (2014)</ref> that corporations were also persons for the protection of religion under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. Specifically, this meant that a corporation had to have a right to opt out of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010, which could require giving [[Health care in the United States|health care]] to employees that the board of directors of the corporation might have religious objections to. It did not specifically address an alternative claim under the [[First Amendment]]. The dissenting four judges emphasized their view that previous cases provided \"no support for the notion that free exercise [of religious] rights pertain to for-profit corporations.\"<ref>per Ginsburg J (dissenting), at page 14 of the dissent [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf 573 US ___] (2014)</ref> Accordingly, the issue of corporate personality has taken on an increasingly political character. Because corporations are typically capable of commanding greater economic power than individual people, and the actions of a corporation may be unduly influenced by directors and the largest [[shareholders]], it raises the issue of the corruption of democratic politics.<ref>cf Kennedy J (dissenting) ''[[Citizens United v Federal Election Commission]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|558|310|2010}}</ref>\n\n===Delegated management and agents===\n{{main|Employment contract|Agency (law)|US labor law}}\nAlthough a corporation may be considered a separate legal person, it physically cannot act by itself. There are, therefore, necessarily rules from the corporation statutes and the [[law of agency]] that attribute the acts of real people to the corporation, to make contracts, deal with property, commission torts, and so on. First, the board of directors will be typically appointed at the first corporate meeting by whoever the [[articles of incorporation]] identify as entitled to elect them. The board is usually given the collective power to direct, manage and represent the corporation. This power (and its limits) is usually delegated to directors by the state's law, or the articles of incorporation.<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] [http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml \u00a7141(a)], \"The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.\" [[California Corporations Code]] [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&group=00001-01000&file=300-318 \u00a7300(a)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113085241/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&group=00001-01000&file=300-318 |date=November 13, 2012 }}.

See further [[A Cox]], DC Bok, RA Gorman and MW Finkin, ''Labor Law Cases and Materials'' (14th edn 2006) 92\u201397</ref> If the state law, or the corporation's bylaws are silent, the terms of these contracts will define in further detail the role of the directors and officers. Third, directors and officers of the corporation will usually have the authority to delegate tasks, and hire employees for the jobs that need performing. Again, the terms of the employment contracts will shape the express terms on which employees act on behalf of the corporation.\n\n[[File:BaristaCountingTips.jpg|thumb|left|The actions of all employees, in the course of employment become those of the corporation, when it goes right or wrong because it is thought that if a corporation takes the benefits of an employee's work, it should also take the burdens.<ref>cf ''[[Turberville v Stampe]]'' (1697) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1792/2684.pdf 91 ER 1072], per [[Lord Holt CJ]]</ref>]]\nToward the outside world, the acts of directors, officers and other employees will be binding on the corporation depending on the [[law of agency]] and principles of [[vicarious liability]] (or ''[[respondeat superior]]''). It used to be that the common law recognized constraints on the total capacity of the corporation. If a director or employee acted beyond the purposes or powers of the corporation (''[[ultra vires]]''), any contract would be ''ex ante'' void and unenforceable. This rule was abandoned in the earlier 20th century,<ref>See RS Stevens, 'A Proposal as to the Codification and Restatement of the Ultra Vires Doctrine' (1927) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/788703 36(3) Yale Law Journal 297] and MA Schaeftler, 'Ultra Vires \u2013 Ultra Useless: The Myth of State Interest in Ultra Vires Acts of Business Corporations' (1983\u20131984) Journal of Corporation Law 81</ref> and today corporations generally have unlimited capacity and purposes.<ref>Revised [[Model Business Corporation Act|MBCA]] \u00a73.01(a) presumption that a corporation's purpose is to 'engage in any lawful business unless a more limited purpose is set forth in the articles of incorporation.' Also \u00a73.04, precludes a corporation from asserting ''ultra vires'' as a defense from having contracts enforced against it.</ref> However, not all actions by corporate agents are binding. For instance, in ''[[South Sacramento Drayage Co v Campbell Soup Co]]''<ref>220 Cal App2d 851, (3d Dist 1963)</ref> it was held that a traffic manager who worked for the [[Campbell Soup Company]] did not (unsurprisingly) have authority to enter a 15-year exclusive dealing contract for intrastate hauling of tomatoes. Standard principles of commercial agency apply (\"[[apparent authority]]\"). If a reasonable person would not think that an employee (given his or her position and role) has authority to enter a contract, then the corporation cannot be bound.<ref>See further, [[Restatement of the Law of Agency]] (3rd edn 2006)</ref> However, corporations can always expressly confer greater authority on officers and employees, and so will be bound if the contracts give express or implied [[actual authority]]. The treatment of liability for contracts and other consent based obligations, however, differs to [[torts]] and other wrongs. Here the objective of the law to ensure the internalization of \"[[externalities]]\" or \"[[enterprise risks]]\" is generally seen to cast a wider scope of liability.\n\n===Shareholder liability for debts===\n{{See also|Enterprise liability|Limited liability|Piercing the corporate veil}}\n{{Slist piercing}}\nOne of the basic principles of modern corporate law is that people who invest in a corporation have [[limited liability]]. For example, as a general rule shareholders can only lose the money they invested in their shares. Practically, limited liability operates only as a [[default rule]] for creditors that can adjust their risk.<ref>LA Bebchuk and JM Freid, 'The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy' (1996) 105 Yale LJ 857, 881\u2013890</ref> Banks which lend money to corporations frequently contract with a corporation's directors or shareholders to get personal [[guarantee]]s, or to take [[security interest]]s their personal assets, or over a corporation's assets, to ensure their debts are paid in full. This means much of the time, shareholders are in fact liable beyond their initial investments. Similarly [[trade creditors]], such as suppliers of raw materials, can use [[title retention clause]] or other device with the equivalent effect to security interests, to be paid before other creditors in bankruptcy.<ref>All such interests need to be registered to take effect under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/9/ art 9]</ref> However, if creditors are unsecured, or for some reason guarantees and security are not enough, creditors cannot (unless there are exceptions) sue shareholders for outstanding debts. Metaphorically speaking, their liability is limited behind the \"corporate veil\". The same analysis, however has been rejected by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Davis v Alexander]]'',<ref>{{ussc|269|114|1925}}</ref> where a railroad subsidiary company caused injury to cattle that were being transported. As [[Brandeis J]] put it, when one \"company actually controls another and operates both as a single system, the dominant company will be liable for injuries due to the [[negligence]] of the subsidiary company.\"\n\n[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The [[International Court of Justice]] in ''[[Re Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co, Ltd]]''<ref>[1970] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1970/1.html ICJ 1]</ref> acknowledged that there is invariably a principle of piercing the veil to prevent abuse of the corporate form.]]\nThere are a number of exceptions, which differ according to the law of each state, to the principle of limited liability. First, at the very least, as is recognized in [[public international law]],<ref>See ''[[Re Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co, Ltd]]'' [1970] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1970/1.html ICJ 1]</ref> courts will \"pierce the corporate veil\" if a corporation is being used evade obligations in a dishonest manner. Defective organization, such as a failure to duly file the articles of incorporation with a state official, is another universally acknowledged ground.<ref>e.g. [[Model Business Corporation Act|MBCA]] \u00a72.04</ref> However, there is considerable diversity in state law, and controversy, over how much further the law ought to go. In ''[[Kinney Shoe Corp v Polan]]''<ref>939 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1991)</ref> the [[Fourth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals]] held that it would also pierce the veil if (1) the corporation had been inadequately capitalized to meet its future obligations (2) if no corporate formalities (e.g. meetings and minutes) had been observed, or (3) the corporation was deliberately used to benefit an associated corporation. However, a subsequent opinion of the same court emphasized that piercing could not take place merely to prevent an abstract notion of \"unfairness\" or \"injustice\".<ref>See ''[[Perpetual Real Estate Services Inc v Michaelson Properties Inc]]'', 974 F2d 545 (4th Cir 1992)</ref> A further, though technically different, equitable remedy is that according to the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Taylor v Standard Gas Co]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|306|307|1939}} known as the \"Deep Rock doctrine\"</ref> corporate insiders (e.g. directors or major shareholders) who are also creditors of a company are subordinated to other creditors when the company goes bankrupt if the company is inadequately capitalized for the operations it was undertaking.\n\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 100506-N-6070S-230.jpg|thumb|right|The trend in US corporate tort cases, particularly in oil spill disasters, as with ''[[The Amoco Cadiz]]'' case and in the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' [[Deepwater Horizon litigation|litigation]], is to either pierce the corporate veil or hold parent corporations directly liable for the harm their enterprise causes.]]\n[[Tort]] victims differ from commercial creditors because they have no ability to contract around limited liability, and are therefore regarded differently under most state laws. The theory developed in the mid-20th century that beyond the corporation itself, it was more appropriate for the law to recognize the economic \"enterprise\", which usually composes [[groups of corporations]], where the parent takes the benefit of a subsidiary's activities and is capable of exercising decisive influence.<ref>See generally [[AA Berle]], 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1118398 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343]</ref> A concept of \"[[enterprise liability]]\" was developed in fields such tax law, accounting practices, and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]] that were gradually received into the courts' jurisprudence. Older cases had suggested that there was no special right to pierce the veil in favor of tort victims, even where pedestrians had been hit by a tram owned by a bankrupt-subsidiary corporation,<ref>''[[Berkey v Third Avenue Railway]]'', 244 NY 602 (1927)</ref> or by taxi-cabs that were owned by undercapitalized subsidiary corporations.<ref>e.g. ''[[Walkovszky v Carlton]]'' 223 NE2d 6 (NY 1966). Contrast the dissent of [[Kenneth Keating|Keating J]] and the Californian decision ''[[Minton v Cavaney]]'', 56 Cal2d 576 (1961). [[Roger Traynor|Traynor J]] held the veil would be pierced when shareholders \"provide inadequate capitalization and actively participate in the conduct of corporate affairs.\" This meant the family of a girl who drowned in a swimming pool would be compensated.</ref> More modern authority suggested a different approach. In a case concerning one of the worst [[oil spill]]s in history, caused by the ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'' which was owned through subsidiaries of the [[Amoco Corporation]], the Illinois court that heard the case stated that the parent corporation was liable by the fact of its group structure.<ref>''[[In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz off the Coast of France on March 16, 1978]]'', 1984 AMC 2123 (ND Ill 1984), McGarr J, at 2191, \"As an integrated multinational corporation which is engaged through a system of subsidiaries in the exploration, production, refining, transportation and sale of petroleum products throughout the world, Standard is responsible for the tortious acts of its wholly owned subsidiaries and instrumentalities, AIOC and Transport.\"</ref> The courts therefore \"usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases\" because tort claimants do not voluntarily accept limited liability.<ref>''[[Perpetual Real Estate Services Inc v Michaelson Properties Inc]]'', 974 F2d 545 (4th Cir 1992) citing WM Fletcher, ''Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations'' (1990) \u00a7 41.85 at 71, \"courts usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases. This is because the party seeking relief in a contract case is presumed to have voluntarily and knowingly entered into an agreement with a corporate entity, and is expected to suffer the consequences of the limited liability associated with the corporate business form, while this is not the situation in tort cases.\" c.f. ''[[Fletcher v Atex Inc]]'' 8 F.3d 1451 (2d Cir. 1995)</ref> Under the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980]], the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v Bestfoods]]''<ref>{{ussc|periods=no|524|51|1998}}</ref> held if a parent corporation \"actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of\" a subsidiary's facilities it \"may be held directly liable\". This leaves the question of the nature of the common law, in absence of a specific statute, or where a state law forbids piercing the veil except on very limited grounds.<ref>e.g. Texas Business Corporation Act of 1997, art 2.21(2)</ref> One possibility is that tort victims go uncompensated, even while a parent corporation is solvent and has insurance. A second possibility is that a compromise liability regime, such as [[pro rata]] rather than [[joint and several liability]] is imposed across all shareholders regardless of size.<ref>Henry Hansmann and Reiner Kraakman, ''Towards Unlimited Liability for Corporate Torts'' 100(7) Yale Law Journal 1879, 1900\u20131901 (1991)</ref> A third possibility, and one that does not interfere with the basics of corporate law, is that a direct duty of care could be owed in [[tort]] to the injured person by parent corporations and major shareholders to the extent they could exercise control. This route means corporate enterprise would not gain a subsidy at the expense of other people's health and environment, and that there is no need to pierce the veil.\n\n==Corporate governance==\n{{see also|Corporate governance}}\n[[File:NYSE127.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[New York Stock Exchange]], along with Federal and state laws, is a significant regulator of corporate governance for listed corporations, particularly on shareholder voting rights and board structures.]]\n[[Corporate governance]], though used in many senses, is primarily concerned with the balance of power among the main actors in a corporation: directors, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.<ref>See [[Peter Gourevitch]] and James Shinn, ''Political Power and Corporate Control'' (Princeton 2005) 4</ref> A combination of a state's corporation law, case law developed by the courts, and a corporation's own [[articles of incorporation]] and [[bylaws]] determine how power is shared. In general, the rules of a corporation's constitution can be written in whatever way its incorporators choose, or however it is subsequently amended, so long as they comply with the minimum compulsory standards of the law. Different laws seek to protect the corporate [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s to different degrees. Among the most important are the voting rights they exercise against the board of directors, either to elect or remove them from office. There is also the right to sue for breaches of duty, and rights of information, typically used to buy, sell and associate, or disassociate on the market.<ref>See [[Robert C. Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' 86 (Aspen 1986)</ref> The federal [[Securities and Exchange Act]] of 1934, requires minimum standards on the process of voting, particularly in a \"[[proxy contest]]\" where competing groups attempt to persuade shareholders to delegate them their \"[[Proxy voting|proxy]]\" vote. Shareholders also often have rights to amend the corporate constitution, call meetings, make business proposals, and have a voice on major decisions, although these can be significantly constrained by the board. Employees of US corporations have often had a voice in corporate management, either indirectly, or sometimes directly, though unlike in many major economies, express \"[[codetermination]]\" laws that allow participation in management have so far been rare.\n\n===Corporate constitutions===\n{{Slist constitution}}\n{{main|Articles of Incorporation|Corporate constitution}}\nIn principle, a corporation's constitution can be designed in any way so long as it complies with the compulsory rules set down by the state or federal legislature. Most state laws, and the federal government, give a broad freedom to corporations to design the relative rights of directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders in the [[articles of incorporation]] and the [[by-laws]]. These are written down during incorporation, and can usually be amended afterwards according to the state law's procedures, which sometimes place obstacles to amendment by a simple majority of shareholders.<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] \u00a7242(b)(1) requires a resolution by the directors, and then a majority vote of shareholders, and the affected classes of shareholder.</ref> In the early 1819 case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward]]''<ref name=\"ussc|periods=no|17|518|1819\"/> the [[US Supreme Court]] held by a majority that there was a presumption that once a corporate charter was made, the corporation's constitution was subject to \"no other control on the part of the Crown than what is expressly or implicitly reserved by the charter itself.\"<ref>cf William A. Klein and [[John C. Coffee]], ''Business Organization and Finance'' 113\u2013114 (9th edn 2004) \"The decision evoked much contemporary protest, because to many it seemed to imply that once a corporate charter was granted, the corporation was beyond legislative control. In fact, its significance was more limited than this because, as Justice Story pointed out ... the state could insert a provision in any charter that it granted reserving its right to amend or further condition the charter.\"</ref> On the facts, this meant that because [[Dartmouth College]]'s charter could not be amended by the New Hampshire legislature, though subsequent state corporation laws subsequently included provisions saying that this could be done. Today there is a general presumption that whatever balance of powers, rights and duties are set down in the constitution remain binding like a [[Contract law in the United States|contract]] would.<ref>cf, the English Court of Appeal case, ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34, cited in Jesse H. Choper, [[John C. Coffee]] and Ronald J. Gilson, ''Cases and Materials on Corporations'' (8th Edition 2012)</ref> Most corporation statutes start with a presumption (in contrast to old ''[[ultra vires]]'' rules) that corporations may pursue any purpose that is lawful,<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] \u00a7102(b)</ref> whether that is running a profitable business, delivering services to the community, or any other objects that people involved in a corporation may choose. By default, the common law had historically suggested that all decisions are to be taken by a majority of the incorporators,<ref>''[[Attorney General v Davy]]'' (1741) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1741/14.pdf 26 ER 531], per [[Lord Hardwicke LC]]</ref> and that by default the board could be removed by a majority of shareholders for a reason they themselves determined.<ref>''[[R v Richardson]]'' (1758) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1758/158.pdf 97 ER 426], per [[Lord Mansfield]]</ref> However these default rules will take subject to the constitution that incorporators themselves define, which in turn take subject to state law and federal regulation.\n\n[[File:NASDAQ stock market display.jpg|thumb|left|The [[NASDAQ]] is the second biggest stock in the US, after the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. It specializes in IT sector, that saw its first major crash with the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000.]]\nAlthough it is possible to structure corporations differently, the two basic organs in a corporate constitution will invariably be the [[general meeting]] of its members (usually shareholders) and the board of directors.<ref>cf ''[[Manson v Curtis]]'', 223 NY 313, 119 NE 559 (1918) holding that the board of directors could not be effectively abolished so as to allow large shareholders to dominate.</ref> Boards of directors themselves have been subject in modern regulation to a growing number of requirements regarding their composition, particularly in federal law for public corporations. Particularly after the [[Enron scandal]], companies listed on the major stock exchanges (the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the [[NASDAQ]], and [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]]) were required to adopt minimum standards on the number of [[independent director]]s, and their functions. These rules are enforced through the threat of delisting by the exchange, while the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] works to ensure ultimate oversight. For example, the [[NYSE Listed Company Manual]] Rule 303A.01 requires that listed companies have a majority of \"independent\" directors.<ref>See also NASDAQ Rule 4350(c)(1)</ref> \"Independence\" is in turn defined by Rule 303A.02 as an absence of material business relationship with the corporation, not having worked for the last three years for the corporation as an employee, not receiving over $120,000 in pay, or generally having family members who are.<ref>See [[NYSE Listed Company Manual]] [http://nysemanual.nyse.com/LCMTools/PlatformViewer.asp?selectednode=chp_1_4&manual=%2Flcm%2Fsections%2Flcm-sections%2F Rule 303A.02]</ref> The idea here is that \"independent\" directors will exercise superior oversight of the executive board members, and thus decrease the likelihood of abuse of power. Specifically, the [[nominations committee]] (which makes future board appointments), [[compensation committee]] (which sets director pay), and [[audit committee]] (which appoints the auditors), are required to be composed of independent directors, as defined by the Rules.<ref>NYSE Rule 303A.04-06. See also NASDAQ Rule 4350(c)(3)-(4) allows one of three directors to lack \"independence\" if he or she is not an officer or family member of an officer.</ref> Similar requirements for boards have proliferated across many countries,<ref>This is generally thought to have begun with the UK [[Cadbury Report]].</ref> and so exchange rules allow foreign corporations that are listed on an American exchange to follow their home jurisdiction's rules, but to disclose and explain how their practices differ (if at all) to the market.<ref>e.g. NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.11</ref> The difficulty, however, is that oversight of executive directors by independent directors still leaves the possibility of personal relationships that develop into a conflict of interest. This raises the importance of the rights that can be exercised against the board as a whole.\n\n===Shareholder rights===\n{{Slist shareholder rights}}\n{{see also|Institutional investor|Shareholder}}\nWhile the board of directors is generally conferred the power to manage the day-to-day affairs of a corporation, either by the statute, or by the [[articles of incorporation]], this is always subject to limits, including the rights that [[shareholders]] have. For example, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] \u00a7141(a) says the \"business and affairs of every corporation ... shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.\"<ref>[[DGCL]] [http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml#TopOfPage \u00a7141(a)] Also see [[DGCL]] \u00a7350, shareholder agreements may only affect a board's discretion in close corporations, and ''[[Galler v Galler]]'', 32 Ill2d 16 (1964)</ref> However, directors themselves are ultimately accountable to the general meeting through the vote. Invariably, shareholders hold the voting rights,<ref>This is not inevitable, as in corporations without shareholders, or those which may choose to give a voice to employees, e.g. Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, ch 156 Business Corporations, [https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156/Section23 \u00a723]</ref> though the extent to which these are useful can be conditioned by the constitution. The [[DGCL]] \u00a7141(k) gives an option to corporations to have a unitary board that can be removed by a majority of members \"without cause\" (i.e. a reason determined by the [[general meeting]] and not by a court), which reflects the old default common law position.<ref>''[[Attorney General v Davy]]'' (1741) 2 Atk 212 and ''[[R v Richardson]]'' (1758) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1758/158.pdf 97 ER 426]</ref> However, Delaware corporations may also opt for a [[classified board of directors]] (e.g. where only a third of directors come up for election each year) where directors can only be removed \"with cause\" scrutinized by the courts.<ref>The case law on the meaning of \"with cause\" is conflicting. In New York, see ''[[Fox v Cody]]'', 141 Misc 552, 252 NYS 395 (Sup Ct 1930) and ''[[Auer v Dressel]]'', 306 NY 427, 118 NE 2d 590, 593 (1954) and in Delaware, see ''[[Campbell v Loew's Inc]]'', 36 Del Ch 563, 134 A 2d 852 (Ch 1957) referring back to ''Auer''.</ref> More corporations have classified boards after [[initial public offerings]] than a few years after going public, because [[institutional investors]] typically seek to change the corporation's rules to make directors more accountable.<ref>Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock, ''Embattled CEOs'', 88(5) Texas Law Review 987, 1008 (2010)</ref> In principle, shareholders in Delaware corporations can make appointments to the board through a majority vote,<ref>[[DGCL]] \u00a7211(b)</ref> and can also act to expand the size of the board and elect new directors with a majority.<ref>[[DGCL]] \u00a7228</ref> However, directors themselves will often control which candidates can be nominated to be appointed to the board. Under the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010, \u00a7971 empowered the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to write a new SEC Rule 14a-11 that would allow shareholders to propose nominations for board candidates. The Act required the SEC to evaluate the economic effects of any rules it wrote, however when it did, the [[Business Roundtable]] challenged this in court. In ''[[Business Roundtable v SEC]]'',<ref>647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011)</ref> [[Douglas H. Ginsburg|Ginsburg J]] in the [[DC Circuit Court of Appeals]] went as far to say that the SEC had \"acted arbitrarily and capriciously\" in its rule making. After this, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] failed to challenge the decision, and abandoned drafting new rules. This means that in many corporations, directors continue to have a monopoly on nominating future directors.\n\n[[File:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] has a statutory duty to regulate some aspects of director elections and shareholder voting rights, though its rule-making authority has continually been challenged by the [[Business Roundtable]].<ref>See ''[[Business Roundtable v Securities and Exchange Commission (2011)|Business Roundtable v SEC]]'', 647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011) and ''[[Business Roundtable v Securities and Exchange Commission (1990)|Business Roundtable v SEC]]'', 905 F2d 406 (DC Cir 1990)</ref>]]\nApart from elections of directors, shareholders' entitlements to vote have been significantly protected by federal regulation, either through stock exchanges or the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Beginning in 1927, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] maintained a \"[[one share, one vote]]\" policy, which was backed by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] from 1940.<ref>See [[Joel Seligman]], ''Equal Protection in Shareholder Voting Rights: The One Common Share, One Vote Controversy'', 54 George Washington Law Review 687 (1986)</ref> This was thought to be necessary to halt corporations issuing non-voting shares, except to banks and other influential corporate insiders.<ref>See [[William Z. Ripley]], ''Two Changes in the Nature and Conduct of Corporations'' 11(4) Trade Associations and Business Combinations 143 (1926); or Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York 695</ref> However, in 1986, under competitive pressure from [[NASDAQ]] and [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]], the NYSE sought to abandon the rule, and the SEC quickly drafted a new Rule 19c-4, requiring the one share, one vote principle. In ''[[Business Roundtable v SEC]]''<ref>905 F 2d 406 (DC Cir 1990)</ref> the [[DC Circuit Court of Appeals]] struck the rule down, though the exchanges and the SEC subsequently made an agreement to regulate shareholder voting rights \"proportionately\". Today, many corporations have unequal shareholder voting rights, up to a limit of ten votes per share.<ref>e.g. [[NYSE Listed Company Manual]] \u00a7313.00</ref> Stronger rights exist regarding shareholders ability to delegate their votes to nominees, or doing \"[[proxy voting]]\" under the [[Securities and Exchange Act]] of 1934. Its provisions were introduced to combat the accumulation of power by directors or management friendly [[voting trusts]] after the [[Wall Street Crash]]. Under SEC Rule 14a-1, proxy votes cannot be solicited except under its rules. Generally, one person soliciting others' proxy votes requires disclosure, although SEC Rule 14a-2 was amended in 1992 to allow shareholders to be exempt from filing requirements when simply communicating with one another,<ref>See, SEC Release No. 34-31326 (October 16, 1992) changing rules so that (1) preparing and filing proxy statements are not needed if a person is not seeking to obtain voting authority from another person, but owners of over $5m are required. (2) no prior review of preliminary proxy solicitation materials (3) proxies are required to unbundle proposals so there are separate votes on each.</ref> and therefore to take [[collective action]] against a board of directors more easily. SEC Rule 14a-9 prohibits any false or misleading statements being made in soliciting proxies. This all matters in a [[proxy contest]], or whenever shareholders wish to change the board or another element of corporate policy. Generally speaking, and especially under Delaware law, this remains difficult. Shareholders often have no rights to call meetings unless the constitution allows,<ref>e.g. [[DGCL]] \u00a7211(d).

Generally state laws give the right for shareholders to vote on decision by the corporation to sell off \"all or substantially all assets\" of the corporation.<ref>DGCL \u00a7271, and cf ''[[Katz v Bregman]]'', 431 A2d 1274 (1981) includes assets under 50% of the company's value.</ref> However fewer states give rights to shareholder to veto political contributions made by the board, unless this is in the articles of incorporation.<ref>cf the United Kingdom [[Companies Act 2006]] ss 366\u2013368 and 378</ref> One of the most contentious issues is the right for shareholders to have a \"[[say on pay]]\" of directors. As executive pay has grown beyond inflation, while average worker wages remained stagnant, this was seen important enough to regulate in the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010 \u00a7951. This provision, however, simply introduced a non-binding vote for shareholders, though better rights can always be introduced in the articles of incorporation. While some [[institutional shareholders]], particularly [[pension funds]], have been active in using shareholder rights, [[asset managers]] regulated by the [[Investment Advisers Act]] of 1940 have tended to be mute in opposing corporate boards, as they are often themselves disconnected from the people whose money they are voting upon.\n\n===Investor rights===\n{{see also|Institutional investor|Pension fund|401(k)|Investment manager}}\nMost state corporate laws require shareholders have governance rights against [[boards of directors]], but fewer states guarantee governance rights to the real investors of capital.

First, rules can restrain or empower the directors in whose favor they exercise their discretion. While older corporate law judgments suggested directors had to promote \"[[shareholder value]]\", most modern state laws empower directors to exercise their own \"[[business judgment]]\" in the way they balance the claims of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Second, all state laws follow the historical pattern of [[fiduciary duties]] to require that directors avoid [[conflicts of interest]] between their own pursuit of profit, and the interests of the corporation. The exact standard, however, may be more or less strict. Third, many states require some kind of basic duty of care in performance of a director's tasks, just as minimum standards of care apply in any [[contract for services]]. However, Delaware has increasingly abandoned substantive objective duties, as it reinterpreted the content of the duty of care, allows liability waivers.\n\n===Stakeholder interests===\n{{main|Stakeholder theory|Corporate social responsibility|Shareholder value}}\n[[File:ARI at CHC 07-15-12 027.JPG|thumb|left|Most states follow the approach in ''[[Shlensky v Wrigley]]'',<ref name=\"237 N.E. 2d 776 Ill. App. 1968\">237 NE 2d 776 (Ill App 1968)</ref> that directors do not only need to maximize shareholder profits. They can balance the interests of all stakeholders, as in a decision to not put in floodlights to play nighttime baseball games, in the community's interest.]] \nMost corporate laws empower directors, as part of their management functions, to determine which strategies will promote a corporation's success in the interests of all stakeholders. Directors will periodically decide whether and how much of a corporation's [[revenue]] should be shared among directors' own pay, the pay for employees (e.g. whether to increase or not next financial year), the [[dividend]]s or other returns to shareholders, whether to lower or raise prices for consumers, whether to retain and reinvest earnings in the business, or whether to make charitable and other donations. Most states have enacted \"[[constituency statute]]s\",<ref>28 states in 1991. See C Hansen, 'Other Constituency Statutes: A Search for Perspective' (1991) 46(4) The Business Lawyer 1355, Appendix A for a list of laws. The Connecticut General Statute Ann. \u00a733-756 goes further than most in requiring directors take account of stakeholders.</ref> which state expressly that directors are empowered to balance the interests of all stakeholders in the way that their conscience, or [[good faith]] decisions would dictate. This discretion typically applies when making a decision about the distribution of corporate resources among different groups, or in whether to defend against a takeover bid. For example, in ''[[Shlensky v Wrigley]]''<ref name=\"237 N.E. 2d 776 Ill. App. 1968\"/> the president of the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball team was sued by stockholders for allegedly failing to pursue the objective of shareholder [[profit maximization]]. The president had decided the corporation would not install flood lights over the baseball ground that would have allowed games could take place at night, because he wished to ensure baseball games were accessible for families, before children's bed time. The Illinois court held that this decision was sound because even though it could have made more money, the director was entitled to regard the interests of the community as more important. Following a similar logic in ''[[AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow]]'' a New Jersey court held that the directors were entitled to make a charitable donation to [[Princeton University]] on the basis because there was \"no suggestion that it was made indiscriminately or to a pet charity of the corporate directors in furtherance of personal rather than corporate ends.\"<ref>39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953)</ref> So long as the directors could not be said to have conflicting interests, their actions would be sustained.\n\n[[File:Ford 1921.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dodge v Ford Motor Co]]'' notoriously held in 1919 that corporations had to be run \"primarily for the profit of the stockholders\" though most states, and the Supreme Court, have since followed the view that directors must balance all stakeholders' interests.<ref>See [[Lynn Stout]], ''Why We Should Stop Teaching Dodge v. Ford'', 3 Virginia Law and Business Review 163 (2008)</ref>]]\nDelaware's law has also followed the same general logic, even though it has no specific constituency or stakeholder statute.<ref>See ''[[Davis v Louisville Gas and Electric Co]]'', 16 Del Ch 157 (1928) 'the directors are chosen to pass upon such questions and their judgment unless shown to be tainted with fraud is accepted as final. The judgment the directors of the corporation enjoys the benefit of a presumption that it was formed in good faith, and was designed to promote the best interests of the corporation they serve.' See also ''[[Unocal Corp v Mesa Petroleum Co]]'', 493 A2d 946 (Del 1985)</ref> The standard is, however, contested largely among business circles which favor a view that directors should act in the sole interests of [[shareholder value]]. Judicial support for this aim is typically found in a case from Michigan in 1919, called ''[[Dodge v Ford Motor Company]]''.<ref>170 NW 668 (Mich 1919)</ref> Here, the [[Ford Motor Company]] president [[Henry Ford]] had publicly announced that he wished not merely to maximize shareholder returns but to raise employee wages, decrease the price of cars for consumers, because he wished, as he put it, \"to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number\". A group of shareholders sued, and the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] said in an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' that a \"business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end.\" However, in the case itself a damages claim against Ford did not succeed, and since then Michigan law has been changed.<ref>[[Michigan Business Corporation Act]] [http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28zvxq5i55n3aif145tywic155%29%29/printDocument.aspx?objectName=mcl-Act-284-of-1972&version=txt \u00a7\u00a7251 and 541a(1)(c)], and see ''[[Churella v Pioneer State Mutual Insurance Co]]'', 671 NW2d 125 (2003) distinguishing ''Dodge''.</ref> The US Supreme Court has also made it clear in ''[[Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc]]'' that shareholder value is not a default or overriding aim of corporate law,<ref>573 U.S. ___ (2014) at page 23, \"While it is certainly true that a central objective of for- profit corporations is to make money, modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives.\"</ref> unless a corporation's rules expressly opt to define such an objective. In practice, many corporations do operate for the benefit of shareholders, but this is less because of duties, and more because shareholders typically exercise a monopoly on the control rights over electing the board. This assumes, however, that directors do not merely use their office to further their own personal goals over the interests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.\n\n===Conflicts of interest===\n{{main|Conflict of interest|Corporate opportunity|Self-dealing}}\nSince the earliest corporations were formed, courts have imposed minimum standards to prevent directors using their office to pursue their own interests over the interests of the corporation. Directors can have no [[conflict of interest]]. In [[trusts law]], this core [[fiduciary duty]] was formulated after the collapse of the [[South Sea Company]] in 1719 in the United Kingdom. ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' held that people in fiduciary positions had to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, and this rule \"should be strictly pursued\".<ref>[1726] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1726/J76.html EWHC Ch J76]</ref> It was later held that no inquiry should be made into transactions where the fiduciary was interested in [[Self-dealing|both sides of the deal]].<ref>See ''[[Whelpdale v Cookson]]'' (1747) 27 ER 856</ref> These principles of equity were received into the law of the United States, and in a modern formulation [[Cardozo J]] said in ''[[Meinhard v Salmon]]'' that the law required \"the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive ... at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\"<ref>164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928)</ref>\n\nThe standards applicable to directors, however, began to depart significantly from traditional principles of equity that required \"no possibility\" of conflict regarding [[corporate opportunities]], and \"no inquiry\" into the actual terms of transactions if tainted by [[self-dealing]]. In a Delaware decision from 1939, ''[[Guth v Loft Inc]]'',<ref>5 A2d 503 (Del 1939)</ref> it was held that [[Charles Guth]], the president of a drink manufacturer named [[Loft Inc.]], had breached his duty to avoid conflicts of interest by purchasing the [[Pepsi company]] and its syrup recipe in his own name, rather than offering it to Loft Inc. However, although the duty was breached, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the court will look at the particular circumstances, and will not regard a conflict as existing if the company it lacked finances to take the opportunity, if it is not in the same line of business, or did not have an \"interest or reasonable expectancy\". More recently, in ''[[Broz v Cellular Information Systems Inc]]'',<ref name=\"637 A2d 148 Del Supr 1996\">637 A2d 148 (Del Supr 1996)</ref> it was held that a non-executive director of CIS Inc, a man named Mr Broz, had not breached his duty when he bought telecommunications licenses for the Michigan area for his own company, [[RFB Cellular Inc.]]. CIS Inc had been shedding licenses at the time, and so Broz alleged that he thought there was no need to inquire whether CIS Inc would be interested. CIS Inc was then taken over, and the new owners pushed for the claim to be brought. The Delaware Supreme Court held that because CIS Inc had not been financially capable at the time to buy licenses, and so there was no actual conflict of interest. In order to be sure, or at least avoid litigation, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] \u00a7144 provides that directors cannot be liable, and a transaction cannot be voidable if it was (1) approved by disinterested directors after full disclosure (2) approved by shareholders after disclosure, or (3) approved by a court as fair.<ref>See also the Revised [[Model Business Corporation Act]] \u00a78.61 and California Corporation Code \u00a7310</ref>\n\n*''[[Miller v Miller]]'', 222 NW.2d 71 (1974)\nCorporate officers and directors may pursue business transactions that benefit themselves as long as they can prove the transaction, although self-interested, was nevertheless intrinsically \"fair\" to the corporation. \n*''[[Lieberman v Becker]]'', 38 Del Ch 540, 155 A 2d 596 (Super Ct 1959)\n*DGCL \u00a7144 contains the rule that the burden for proving unfairness remains on plaintiff after disclosure\n*''[[Flieger v Lawrence]]'', 361 A2d 218 (Del 1976) the burden of proof shifts onto the plaintiff to show a transaction was conflicted if approval by disinterested stockholders or directors has been given to a transaction.

Generally speaking, the duty of care requires an objective standard of diligence and skill when people perform services, which could be expected from a reasonable person in a similar position (e.g. auditors must act \"with the care and caution proper to their calling\",<ref>See ''[[Ultramares Corporation v Touche]]'', 174 N.E. 441 (1932)</ref> and builders must perform their work in line with \"industry standards\"<ref>See ''[[Terlinde v Neely]]'', 275 SC 395, 271 SE2d 768 (1980)</ref>). In a 1742 decision of the English [[Court of Chancery]], ''[[The Charitable Corporation v Sutton]]'',<ref>(1742) 26 ER 642</ref> the directors of the [[Charitable Corporation]], which gave out small loans to the needy, were held liable for failing to keep procedures in place that would have prevented three officers defrauding the corporation of a vast sum of money. [[Lord Hardwicke]], noting that a director's office was of a \"mixed nature\", partly \"of the nature of a public office\" and partly like \"agents\" employed in \"trust\", held that the directors were liable. Though they were not to be judged with [[hindsight]], Lord Hardwicke said he could \"never determine that frauds of this kind are out of the reach of courts of law or equity, for an intolerable grievance would follow from such a determination.\" Many states have similarly maintained an objective baseline duty of care for corporate directors, while acknowledging different levels of care can be expected from directors of small or large corporations, and from directors with executive or non-executive roles on the board.<ref>e.g. ''[[Barnes v Andrews]]'', 298 F 614 (SDNY 1924) A director of the [[Liberty Starter Co]], now insolvent, was accused of having contributed to the failure by being inattentive on the board. Acknowledging the duty of care, but distinguishing on these facts, [[Learned Hand J]] held, \"It is easy to say he should have done something, but that will not serve to harness upon him the whole loss, nor is it the equivalent of saying that, had he acted, the company would now flourish. An inattentive director or directors cannot be held liable for a corporate loss if it is shown that proper attentiveness to corporate affairs by all the directors would still not have prevented the loss complained of. In order words, it must be demonstrated that the accused director's slothfulness was a cause of the company's loss. This notion of causation is thus a critical element in any action brought against a poorly performing board of directors and has had a tremendous impact on the course of modern corporate governance.\"</ref> However, in Delaware, as in a number of other states,<ref>e.g. Indiana Code Ann \u00a723-1-35(1)(e)(2) requires willful misconduct or recklessness before any liability. c.f. [[Model Business Corporation Act]] \u00a78.30(a) which requires a director act in good faith and what he or she reasonably believes to be in the company's best interests.</ref> the existence of a duty of care has become increasingly uncertain.\n\n[[File:Flickr - paul bica - LA morning.jpg|thumb|left|''[[In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation]]''<ref name=\"964 A 2d 106 Del Ch 2009\">964 A 2d 106 (Del Ch 2009)</ref> ensured that no director of any major banking corporation could be held liable for breach of the [[duty of care]], even though its risky practices caused the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref>See further, JC Coffee, 'What went wrong? An initial inquiry into the causes of the 2008 financial crisis' (2009) 9(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 1</ref>]]\nIn 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court passed one of its most debated judgments, ''[[Smith v Van Gorkom]]''.<ref>488 A2d 858 (Sup Ct Del 1985) Before this, the leading case was ''[[Graham v Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co]]'', 188 A2d 125 (Del Supr 1963)</ref> The directors of [[TransUnion]], including [[Jerome W. Van Gorkom]], were sued by the shareholders for failing to adequately research the corporation's value, before approving a sale price of $55 per share to the [[Marmon Group]]. The Court held that to be a protected business judgment, \"the directors of a corporation [must have] acted on an [[Informed consent|informed basis]], in [[good faith]] and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.\" Failing to act on an informed basis, if it caused loss, would amount to [[gross negligence]], and here the directors were liable. The decision triggered a panic among corporate boards which believed they would be exposed to massive liability, and insurance firms who feared rising costs of providing [[directors and officers liability insurance]] to corporate boards. In response to lobbying, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] was amended to insert a new \u00a7102(b)(7). This allowed corporations to give directors immunity from liability for breach of the duty of care in their charter. However, for those corporations which did not introduce liability waivers, the courts subsequently proceeded to reduce the duty of care outright.<ref>See also ''[[Cinerama Inc v Technicolor, Inc]]'', 663 A.2d 1156 (1995) directors proved the 'entire fairness' of a merger, selling to MacAndrews & Forbes Group, even though directors failed to conduct an adequate market check to determine if other bidders would have given a higher price. ''Van Gorkom'' was distinguished.</ref> In 1996, ''[[In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation]]''<ref>698 A 2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996)</ref> required \"an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists\", and in 2003 ''[[In re Walt Disney Derivative Litigation]]''<ref>825 A 2d 275 (2003)</ref> went further. [[Chancellor Chandler]] held directors could only be liable for showing \"reckless indifference to or a deliberate disregard of the whole body of stockholders\" through actions that are \"without the bounds of reason\".<ref>See also, ''[[Brehm v Eisner]]'', 746 A.2d 244 (2000) Del Supreme Court, \"Due care in the decisionmaking context is process due care only. Irrationality is the outer limit of the business judgment rule. Irrationality may be the functional equivalent of the waste test or it may tend to show that the decision is not made in good faith, which is a key ingredient of the business judgment rule.\"</ref> In one of the cases that came out of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], the same line of reasoning was deployed in ''[[In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation]]''.<ref name=\"964 A 2d 106 Del Ch 2009\"/> [[Chancellor Chandler]], confirming his previous opinions in ''Re Walt Disney'' and the ''dicta'' of ''Re Caremark'', held that the directors of [[Citigroup]] could not be liable for failing to have a warning system in place to guard against potential losses from [[sub-prime mortgage debt]]. Although there had been several indications of the significant risks, and Citigroup's practices along with its competitors were argued to have contributed to crashing the international economy, Chancellor Chandler held that \"plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove bad faith conduct by the director defendants\". This suggested that Delaware law had effectively negated any substantive duty of care. This suggested that corporate directors were exempt from duties that any other professional performing services would owe. It remained unclear, with a change in the Chief Justice of the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] in 2014, whether this position would remain.\n\n===Derivative suits===\n{{main|Derivative suit}}\n{{Slist derivative suit}}\nBecause directors owe their duties to the corporation and not, as a general rule, to specific shareholders or stakeholders, the right to sue for breaches of directors duty rests by default with the corporation itself. The corporation is necessarily party to the suit.<ref>See generally ''[[Davenport v Dows]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|85|626|1873}} and ''[[Ross v Bernhard]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|396|531|1970}}</ref> This creates a difficulty because almost always, the right to litigate falls under the general powers of directors to manage the corporation day to day (e.g. [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] \u00a7141(a)). Often, cases arise (such as in ''[[Broz v Cellular Information Systems Inc]]''<ref name=\"637 A2d 148 Del Supr 1996\"/>) where an action is brought against a director because the corporation has been taken over and a new, non-friendly board is in place, or because the board has been replaced after bankruptcy. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a conflict of interest because directors will be reluctant to sue their colleagues, particularly when they develop personal ties. The law has sought to define further cases where groups other than directors can sue for breaches of duty. First, many jurisdictions outside the US allow a specific percentage of shareholders to bring a claim as of right (e.g. 1 per cent).<ref>e.g., the German [[Aktiengesetz]] 1965 [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aktg/__148.html \u00a7148]</ref> This solution may still entail significant [[collective action problems]] where shareholders are dispersed, like the US. Second, some jurisdictions give standing to sue to non-shareholder groups, particularly creditors, whose collective action problems are less.<ref>e.g. ''[[BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders]]'' [2008] [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc69/2008scc69.html 3 SCR 560]</ref> Otherwise, third, the main alternative is that any individual shareholder may \"derive\" a claim on the corporation's behalf to sue for breach of duty, but such a derivative suit will be subject to permission from the court.\n\n[[File:Larry Ellison in Oracle OpenWorld 2010.JPG|thumb|left|Increasingly courts have denied that the board should restrict derivative suits, as in the 2003 case ''[[In re Oracle Corp Derivative Litigation]]''<ref>824 A.2d 917 (2003)</ref> where it was held that an [[insider trading]] claim against [[Oracle Corp]] CEO [[Larry Ellison]] could proceed.<ref>The case was subsequently settled. See 'Oracle's Chief in Agreement to Settle Insider Trading Lawsuit' (September 12, 2005) [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/12/technology/12oracle.html?_r=0 NY Times]</ref>]]\nThe risk of allowing individual shareholders to bring derivative suits is usually thought to be that it could encourage costly, distracting litigation, or \"[[strike suit]]s\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yehezkel|first1=Ariel|last2=Ackerman|first2=Amanda|title=Court Sets Forth Road Map for Defending \"Strike Suits\"|url= https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/court-sets-forth-road-map-defending-strike-suits|publisher=Transaction Advisors|issn=2329-9134}}</ref> \u2013 or simply that litigation (even if the director is guilty of a breach of duty) could be seen as counterproductive by a majority of shareholders or stakeholders who have no conflicts of interest. Accordingly, it is generally thought that oversight by the court is justified to ensure derivative suits match the corporation's interests as a whole because courts may be more independent. However, especially from the 1970s some states, and especially Delaware, began also to require that the board have a role. Most [[common law]] jurisdictions have abandoned role for the board in derivative claims,<ref>See for example, the UK [[Companies Act 2006]] ss [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/11 261\u2013263]</ref> and in most US states before the 1980s, the board's role was no more than a formality.<ref>See RM Buxbaum, 'Conflict-of-Interest Statutes and the Need for a Demand on Directors in Derivative Actions' (1980) 68 Californian Law Review 1122</ref> But then, a formal role for the board was reintroduced. In the procedure to bring a derivative suit, the first step is often that the shareholder had to make a \"demand\" on the board to bring a claim.<ref>Delaware Chancery Court Rules, Rule 23.1, requires exhaustion of internal remedies.</ref> Although it might appear strange to ask a group of directors who will be sued, or whose colleagues are being sued, for permission, Delaware courts took the view that the decision to litigate ought by default to lie within the legitimate scope of directors' business judgment. For example, in ''[[Aronson v Lewis]]''<ref>473 A 2d 805, 812 (Del 1984)</ref> a shareholder of the Meyers Parking System Inc claimed that the board had improperly wasted corporate assets by giving its 75-year-old director, Mr Fink, a large salary and bonus for consultancy work even though the contract did not require performance of any work. Mr Fink had also personally selected all of the directors. Nevertheless, [[Andrew G. T. Moore II|Moore J.]] held for the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] that there was still a requirement to make a demand on the board before a derivative suit could be brought. There was \"a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was taken in the best interests of the company\", even if they owed their jobs to the person being sued. A requirement to make a demand on the board will, however, be excused if it is shown that it would be entirely \"futile\", primarily because a majority of the board is alleged to have breached its duty. Otherwise it must be shown that all board members are in some very strong sense conflicted, but merely working with the accused directors, and the personal ties this potentially creates, is insufficient for some courts.<ref>e.g. in New York, see ''[[Barr v Wackman]]'' 329 NE.2d 180 (1975) and ''[[In re Kaufmann Mutual Fund Actions]]'', 479 F.2d 257 (1973) cert denied 414 US 857 (1973)</ref> This indicated a significant and controversial change in Delaware's judicial policy, that prevented claims against boards.\n\n[[File:1981 US Cabinet.jpg|right|thumb|In 1981, in ''[[Zapata Corp v Maldonado]]''<ref name=\"430 A 2d 779 Del Sup 1981\">430 A 2d 779 (Del Sup 1981)</ref> the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of [[Zapata Corp.]], founded by [[George H.W. Bush]], could not be sued for breach of fiduciary duty. An \"independent investigation committee\" was competent to reject the demand for a derivative suit, despite being appointed by the board.]]\nIn some cases corporate boards attempted to establish \"independent litigation committees\" to evaluate whether a shareholder's demand to bring a suit was justified. This strategy was used to pre-empt criticism that the board was conflicted. The directors would appoint the members of the \"independent committee\", which would then typically deliberate and come to the conclusion that there was no good cause for bringing litigation. In ''[[Zapata Corp v Maldonado]]''<ref name=\"430 A 2d 779 Del Sup 1981\"/> the Delaware Supreme Court held that if the committee acted in good faith and showed reasonable grounds for its conclusion, and the court could be \"satisfied [about] other reasons relating to the process\", the committee's decision to not allow a claim could not be overturned. Applying Connecticut law, the [[Second Circuit Federal Court of Appeals]] held in ''[[Joy v North]]''<ref>692 F.2d 880 (1982)</ref> that the court could substitute its judgment for the decisions of a supposedly independent committee, and the board, on the ground that there was scope for conflicting interests. Then, the substantive merits for bringing the derivative claim would be assessed. [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.|Winter J]] held overall that shareholders would have the burden \"to demonstrate that the action is more likely than not to be against the interests of the corporation\". This would entail a cost benefit analysis. On the benefit side would be \"the likely recoverable damages discounted by the probability of a finding of liability\", and the costs side would include \"attorney's fees and other out-of-pocket expenses\", \"time spent by corporate personnel\", \"the impact of distraction of key personnel\", and potential lost profits which may result from the publicity of a trial.\" If it is thought that the costs exceed the benefits, then the shareholders acquire the right to sue on the corporation's behalf. A substantive hearing on the merits about the alleged breach of director's duty may be heard. The tendency in Delaware, however, has remained to allow the board to play a role in restricting litigation, and therefore minimize the chances that it could be held accountable for basic breaches of duty.<ref>c.f. more recently, ''[[In re Oracle Corp Derivative Litigation]]'', 824 A.2d 917 (2003) concerning [[insider trading]], approving a derivative claim on the basis of the director's personal ties.</ref>\n\n==Minority shareholder protections==\n{{see also|Oppression remedy|Unfair prejudice}}\n*''[[Ivanhoe Partners v Newmont Mining Corp.]]'', 535 A.2d 1334 (Del. 1987) a shareholder owning over 50% of shares is a controlling shareholder; but actual control may also be present through other mechanisms\n*''[[Citron v Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp.]]'', 569 A.2d 53, 70 (Del. 1989) non-controlling shareholders do not owe duties to minority shareholders and may vote their shares for personal gain without concern\n*''[[In re Cysive, Inc.

The game was a departure from the rest of the ''[[Dead or Alive (series)|Dead or Alive]]'' series which otherwise consisted of [[fighting game]]s. It also marked the first game in the series to have a Mature rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]].\n\nThe game is set immediately after the tournament in ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' ended. Gameplay revolves around the women of the ''DOA'' series playing various mini-games in the many locations of Zack Island, a reclusive private resort on an island owned by [[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]], the only male character from the series to appear anywhere in the game. This installment features no fighting engine, instead being much like a simulation game that encourages the player to establish relationships with the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] of characters, and eventually make a two-person team to compete in volleyball competitions. Currency earned from completing mini-games and gambling in the island's casino allows the player to purchase hundreds of different swimsuits to wear in the game.\n\nIts sequel, ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 2]]'', was released on November 13, 2006, exclusively for the [[Xbox 360]]. The next sequel, ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 3]]'', was released on March 24, 2016 in Asian countries exclusively for  [[Sony]]'s [[video game console]]s, [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn the main story mode, players select a woman to play as for the duration of their two-week period. Since the [[volleyball]] matches in the game are always two on two, the player automatically begins with a partner. Each day, players can select one activity in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. While players do have an opportunity to simply relax during these time periods, they are generally used to either court new partners, or to challenge existing partnerships to a game of volleyball. Winning a match provides money which can be used to buy swimsuits and accessories, either for oneself, or as gifts to bestow upon the other women. Alternatively, players can also earn money through [[gambling]] at a casino located on the island.\n\nPlaying volleyball is done primarily through the use of two buttons, one designated for [[volleyball jargon|spiking]] and blocking, and the other for receiving or setting. As many of the actions happen automatically (e.g., jumping up to spike the ball), the game forces the player to focus on timing; a poorly timed press of a button results in a weak hit or a smash into the net. While it is possible to manually direct one's partner towards or away from the net, she will generally move to cover whichever area the player has left empty. The game is one of the few to make use of the analog sensitivity of the face buttons on the Xbox controller, with a softer touch allowing one to barely hit the ball over the net.\n\nIn addition to the core volleyball mechanic, the game features a relationship system between the various women on the island. Through gifts and skillful play, players can induce other characters to increase their esteem and positive feelings toward the character being played. A positive relationship with one's partner can translate into better performance during a volleyball match, while strong relationships with the other women leads to opportunities for new partners. Conversely, negative feelings from a partner can lead to missteps on the court, or can lead to gifts being thrown away unopened.\n\nAll money carries over between vacations, so that unspent \"Zack bucks\" can be used by a different character selected on the next play-through. Similarly, all swimsuits acquired by a given character remain with that character for all future play sessions. Since each character has access to a different set of swimsuits at the shop, the majority of suits for each character can only be acquired as gifts. Many of the costumes are very revealing and make the women appear almost nude in some instances. This, coupled with the suggestive poses the women present themselves in (which can be viewed and zoomed in on from almost any angle, as controlled by the player) led to the first Mature rating in the series' history.\n\n== Characters ==\nThe playable characters consist of seven females from the previous ''Dead or Alive'' titles, plus Lisa, who makes her first appearance in this title. [[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]] (voiced by [[Dennis Rodman]]) is not a playable character but appears in the game's beginning and ending cinematics, with small appearances throughout the game. His girlfriend, [[Nikki (Dead or Alive character)|Niki]], appears only in cutscenes. As such, the volleyball players consist of:\n\n* [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] \u2013 Japanese ninja and rival (as well as half-sister) of Kasumi.\n* [[Christie (Dead or Alive)|Christie]] \u2013 British assassin and automobile enthusiast.\n* [[Helena Douglas|Helena]] \u2013 French opera singer fond of walking her dog.\n* [[Hitomi (Dead or Alive)|Hitomi]] \u2013 German/Japanese high-school student and aspiring chef.\n* [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]] \u2013 Japanese runaway ninja who enjoys fortune-telling and [[origami]].\n* [[Leifang]] \u2013 Chinese college student with an interest in [[aromatherapy]].\n* [[List of Dead or Alive characters#La Mariposa/Lisa Hamilton|Lisa]] \u2013 American stock broker and amateur surfer.\n* [[Tina Armstrong|Tina]] \u2013 American wrestler and daughter of [[Bass Armstrong]].\n\nEach of the playable characters has her own likes and dislikes (documented in the game manual), which influence how likely she is to accept or be impressed by certain gifts. Favorable gifts include those based on her favorite food, favorite color, and hobbies. In order to suit the lighter, more playful nature of the game, the ''Dead or Alive'' characters' previous rivalries were reduced to just a general dislike in this title. As a result, even characters who would normally try to kill another (such as Ayane and Kasumi, or Christie and Helena) can become fast friends through a brief exchange of gifts.\n\n==Plot==\nZack gambles his winnings from the ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' tournament at a casino. In the process, he hits the jackpot, earning a ridiculously large sum of money. The money is used to purchase a private island, which he promptly turns into a resort named after himself (\"Zack Island\"). He then invites the women from the previous tournament (along with one newcomer &mdash; his girlfriend, Niki) to his island under the pretense that the next Dead or Alive tournament will be held there. The women arrive and after discovering the truth, (namely that it was merely a hoax) decide to make the best of the situation by spending two weeks vacationing on the island.\n\nAt the end of the two-week time period, the ladies depart, leaving only Zack and Niki on the island. Shortly thereafter, a volcano, previously thought to be inactive, spontaneously erupts, threatening to destroy Zack's island. In the chaos, Niki escapes using Zack's jetpack. Zack survives the volcanic eruption, but the island itself is completely destroyed. While not part of the game itself, Zack's later ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'' ending shows the pair robbing an ancient tomb and escaping with a truck filled with gold, suggesting a possible financing source for a sequel. In the sequel, it is confirmed that this is indeed the source for financing \"New Zack Island\".\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 5px;\"\n|-\n!

The game was a departure from the rest of the ''[[Dead or Alive (series)|Dead or Alive]]'' series which otherwise consisted of [[fighting game]]s. It also marked the first game in the series to have a Mature rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]].\n\nThe game is set immediately after the tournament in ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' ended. Gameplay revolves around the women of the ''DOA'' series playing various mini-games in the many locations of Zack Island, a reclusive private resort on an island owned by [[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]], the only male character from the series to appear anywhere in the game. This installment features no fighting engine, instead being much like a simulation game that encourages the player to establish relationships with the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] of characters, and eventually make a two-person team to compete in volleyball competitions. Currency earned from completing mini-games and gambling in the island's casino allow the player to purchase hundreds of different swimsuits to wear in the game.\n\nIts sequel, ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 2]]'', was released on November 13, 2006, exclusively for the [[Xbox 360]]. The next sequel, ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 3]]'', was released on March 24, 2016 in Asian countries exclusively for  [[Sony]]'s [[video game console]]s, [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn the main story mode, players select a woman to play as for the duration of their two-week period. Since the [[volleyball]] matches in the game are always two on two, the player automatically begins with a partner. Each day, players can select one activity in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. While players do have an opportunity to simply relax during these time periods, they are generally used to either court new partners, or to challenge existing partnerships to a game of volleyball. Winning a match provides money which can be used to buy swimsuits and accessories, either for oneself, or as gifts to bestow upon the other women. Alternatively, players can also earn money through [[gambling]] at a casino located on the island.\n\nPlaying volleyball is done primarily through the use of two buttons, one designated for [[volleyball jargon|spiking]] and blocking, and the other for receiving or setting. As many of the actions happen automatically (e.g., jumping up to spike the ball), the game forces the player to focus on timing; a poorly timed press of a button results in a weak hit or a smash into the net. While it is possible to manually direct one's partner towards or away from the net, she will generally move to cover whichever area the player has left empty. The game is one of the few to make use of the analog sensitivity of the face buttons on the Xbox controller, with a softer touch allowing one to barely hit the ball over the net.\n\nIn addition to the core volleyball mechanic, the game features a relationship system between the various women on the island. Through gifts and skillful play, players can induce other characters to increase their esteem and positive feelings toward the character being played. A positive relationship with one's partner can translate into better performance during a volleyball match, while strong relationships with the other women leads to opportunities for new partners. Conversely, negative feelings from a partner can lead to missteps on the court, or can lead to gifts being thrown away unopened.\n\nAll money carries over between vacations, so that unspent \"Zack bucks\" can be used by a different character selected on the next play-through. Similarly, all swimsuits acquired by a given character remain with that character for all future play sessions. Since each character has access to a different set of swimsuits at the shop, the majority of suits for each character can only be acquired as gifts. Many of the costumes are very revealing and make the women appear almost nude in some instances. This, coupled with the suggestive poses the women present themselves in (which can be viewed and zoomed in on from almost any angle, as controlled by the player) led to the first Mature rating in the series' history.\n\n== Characters ==\nThe playable characters consist of seven females from the previous ''Dead or Alive'' titles, plus Lisa, who makes her first appearance in this title. [[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]] (voiced by [[Dennis Rodman]]) is not a playable character but appears in the game's beginning and ending cinematics, with small appearances throughout the game. His girlfriend, [[Nikki (Dead or Alive character)|Niki]], appears only in cutscenes. As such, the volleyball players consist of:\n\n* [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] \u2013 Japanese ninja and rival (as well as half-sister) of Kasumi.\n* [[Christie (Dead or Alive)|Christie]] \u2013 British assassin and automobile enthusiast.\n* [[Helena Douglas|Helena]] \u2013 French opera singer fond of walking her dog.\n* [[Hitomi (Dead or Alive)|Hitomi]] \u2013 German/Japanese high-school student and aspiring chef.\n* [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]] \u2013 Japanese runaway ninja who enjoys fortune-telling and [[origami]].\n* [[Leifang]] \u2013 Chinese college student with an interest in [[aromatherapy]].\n* [[List of Dead or Alive characters#La Mariposa/Lisa Hamilton|Lisa]] \u2013 American stock broker and amateur surfer.\n* [[Tina Armstrong|Tina]] \u2013 American wrestler and daughter of [[Bass Armstrong]].\n\nEach of the playable characters has her own likes and dislikes (documented in the game manual), which influence how likely she is to accept or be impressed by certain gifts. Favorable gifts include those based on her favorite food, favorite color, and hobbies. In order to suit the lighter, more playful nature of the game, the ''Dead or Alive'' characters' previous rivalries were reduced to just a general dislike in this title. As a result, even characters who would normally try to kill another (such as Ayane and Kasumi, or Christie and Helena) can become fast friends through a brief exchange of gifts.\n\n==Plot==\nZack gambles his winnings from the ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' tournament at a casino. In the process, he hits the jackpot, earning a ridiculously large sum of money. The money is used to purchase a private island, which he promptly turns into a resort named after himself (\"Zack Island\"). He then invites the women from the previous tournament (along with one newcomer &mdash; his girlfriend, Niki) to his island under the pretense that the next Dead or Alive tournament will be held there. The women arrive and after discovering the truth, (namely that it was merely a hoax) decide to make the best of the situation by spending two weeks vacationing on the island.\n\nAt the end of the two-week time period, the ladies depart, leaving only Zack and Niki on the island. Shortly thereafter, a volcano, previously thought to be inactive, spontaneously erupts, threatening to destroy Zack's island. In the chaos, Niki escapes using Zack's jetpack. Zack survives the volcanic eruption, but the island itself is completely destroyed. While not part of the game itself, Zack's later ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'' ending shows the pair robbing an ancient tomb and escaping with a truck filled with gold, suggesting a possible financing source for a sequel. In the sequel, it is confirmed that this is indeed the source for financing \"New Zack Island\".\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 5px;\"\n|-\n!
