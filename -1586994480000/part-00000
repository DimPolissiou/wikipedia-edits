This allowed Jessen to steer a course that brought ''Lougen'' under the protection of the shore batteries and then into St Thomas. The Danish government awarded Captain Jessen a presentation sword made of gold, a medal and 400 [[rixdollar]]s (the equivalent of a whole year's salary for a captain in the Danish Navy) for his actions<ref>[https://www.navalhistory.dk/English/History/1801_1814/Lougen_WestKay_1801.htm Balsved - Battle of West Kay]</ref>.\n\n==Fate==\nBritish naval and military activity in the area could not be countered. British forces took ''Lougen'' as a prize when they occupied the Danish West Indies in March. One year later, in 1802, the British returned ''Lougen'' to Denmark when peace was restored. The Danes later decommissioned the brig and she was broken up.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n<br>\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{in lang|da}} The Danish Naval Museum is building [http://www.orlogsbasen.dk a new website] at which many details, drawings and models may be available.

He is the grandson of [[Konosuke Matsushita]], founder of [[Panasonic]]. His father [[Masaharu Matsushita]] who served as the second President of [[Panasonic]] for sixteen years beginning in 1961. His elder brother Masayuki Matsushita is the current Vice Chairman of [[Panasonic]]. His relationship has allowed him to receive financial backing from Panasonic throughout his racing career.\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Early career===\nMatsushita started his career racing motorcycles in his home country between 1977 and 1979, before making the switch to four wheels. With Panasonic backing, he then moved to the [[United States]] and entered his first [[Formula Ford]] race in 1986. He came second at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and third at the [[Sebring 12 Hours]] in 1988. Matsushita began to make his name known by winning 1989 [[Champ Car Atlantic Championship|Toyota Atlantic]] championship (Pacific division) with the largest point margin of all time.\n\n===CART Champ Car===\n[[File:Hiro Matshishita in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hiro Matsushita in 1991]]\nHe graduated to Champ Car in 1990, scoring one point in his debut season. Inexplicably, he never showed the pace that took him to four Atlantic victories; instead, he quickly earned a reputation for being at the tail end of the grid, always outperformed by his teammates. Nonetheless, he became the first Japanese driver to race in the [[Indianapolis 500]]<ref>http://open-wheels.com/indycar-flashback-1991-indianapolis-500/ IndyCar Flashback: 1991 Indianapolis 500</ref> in [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]], and followed that achievement with a top ten finish at [[Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee]]. Matsushita missed the [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992 Indy 500]] after suffering a broken leg during a practice crash. He was sidelined for several weeks and missed the next six events as well.\n\nAt the [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]] race in 1994, Matsushita endured a horrific crash in which his car was cut in half by [[Jacques Villeneuve]]'s car traveling at full speed. He emerged from his destroyed car unscathed. The same year, he earned his best career finish of 6th position at the Marlboro 500 at [[Michigan International Speedway]]. This result was made possible by an extraordinarily high rate of attrition that saw only 8 cars finish the race. Matsushita was 11 laps behind the leader at the drop of the checkered flag.\n\nBy the time he retired in 1998, Matsushita had started 117 Champ Car races for [[Dick Simon Racing]], [[Walker Racing]], Arciero/Wells Racing and [[Dale Coyne Racing|Payton/Coyne]]. He holds the record for most starts in [[American Championship Car Racing]] history without scoring a Top 5.\n\nIn 2001, Matsushita competed in the [[Baja 1000]] off-road race in a [[Mitsubishi Montero]].\n\n===Nickname===\nMatsushita earned the nickname \"King Hiro\" from [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who was complaining about Matsushita's reluctance to cede track position when getting lapped by the leaders.<ref>{{cite news | last = Oreovicz | first = John | title = Tora Finding His Form | publisher = ChampCarWorldSeries.com | date = 2001-08-22 | URL = http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=1678 | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214010/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=1678 | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The nickname came about as a result of the [[Voice-operated switch|voice-activated microphone]] (\"vox\") Roger Penske's team was using.

He is the grandson of [[Konosuke Matsushita]], founder of [[Panasonic]]. His father [[Masaharu Matsushita]] who served as the second President of [[Panasonic]] for sixteen years beginning in 1961. His elder brother Masayuki Matsushita is the current Vice Chairman of [[Panasonic]]. His relationship has allowed him to receive financial backing from Panasonic throughout his racing career.\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Early career===\nMatsushita started his career racing motorcycles in his home country between 1977 and 1979, before making the switch to four wheels. With Panasonic backing, he then moved to the [[United States]] and entered his first [[Formula Ford]] race in 1986. He came second at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and third at the [[Sebring 12 Hours]] in 1988. Matsushita began to make his name known by winning 1989 [[Champ Car Atlantic Championship|Toyota Atlantic]] championship (Pacific division) with the largest point margin of all time.\n\n===CART Champ Car===\n[[File:Hiro Matshishita in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hiro Matsushita in 1991]]\nHe graduated to Champ Car in 1990, scoring one point in his debut season. Inexplicably, he never showed the pace that took him to four Atlantic victories; instead, he quickly earned a reputation for being at the tail end of the grid, always outperformed by his teammates. Nonetheless, he became the first Japanese driver to race in the [[Indianapolis 500]]<ref>http://open-wheels.com/indycar-flashback-1991-indianapolis-500/ IndyCar Flashback: 1991 Indianapolis 500</ref> in [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]], and followed that achievement with a top ten finish at [[Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee]]. Matsushita missed the [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992 Indy 500]] after suffering a broken leg during a practice crash. He was sidelined for several weeks and missed the next six events as well.\n\nAt the [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]] race in 1994, Matsushita endured a horrific crash in which his car was cut in half by [[Jacques Villeneuve]]'s car traveling at full speed. He emerged from his destroyed car unscathed. The same year, he earned his best career finish of 6th position at the Marlboro 500 at [[Michigan International Speedway]]. This result was made possible by an extraordinarily high rate of attrition that saw only 8 cars finish the race. Matsushita was 11 laps behind the leader at the drop of the checkered flag.\n\nBy the time he retired in 1998, Matsushita had started 117 Champ Car races for [[Dick Simon Racing]], [[Walker Racing]], Arciero/Wells Racing and [[Dale Coyne Racing|Payton/Coyne]]. He holds the record for most starts in [[American Championship Car Racing]] history without scoring a Top 5.\n\nIn 2001, Matsushita competed in the [[Baja 1000]] off-road race in a [[Mitsubishi Montero]].\n\n===Nickname===\nMatsushita earned the nickname \"King Hiro\" from [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who was complaining about Matsushita's reluctance to cede track position when getting lapped by the leaders.<ref>{{cite news | last = Oreovicz | first = John | title = Tora Finding His Form | publisher = ChampCarWorldSeries.com | date = 2001-08-22 | URL = http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=1678 | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214010/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=1678 | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The nickname came about as a result of the [[Voice-operated switch|voice-activated microphone]] (\"vox\") Roger Penske's team was using. Fittipaldi's epithet was said so quickly that the circuit cut off the first syllable of the first word he used. Fittipaldi, allegedly, had intended to say \"Fucking Hiro!\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Motor Sports Dictionary - K| work=Dictionary of Gambling | url=http://www.dictionaryofgambling.com/gambling_terms/motor_sports/k/ | accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===American open\u2013wheel racing results===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]])\n\n====Indy Lights====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!
