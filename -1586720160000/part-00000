In 1943 however, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] agreed in the [[Declaration of Moscow]] that Austria would instead be regarded as [[Austria \u2014 the Nazis' first victim|the first victim of Nazi aggression]], and treated as a liberated and independent country after the war.\n\nIn the immediate [[aftermath of World War II]], Austria was divided into four occupation zones and jointly occupied by the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Fourth French Republic|France]]. [[Vienna]] was similarly subdivided but the central district was collectively administered by the [[Allied Control Council]].\n\nWhereas Germany was divided into [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] in 1949, Austria remained under joint occupation of the Western Allies and of the Soviet Union until 1955; its status became a controversial subject in the [[Cold War]] until the warming of relations known as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. After Austrian promises of perpetual neutrality, Austria was accorded full independence on 15 May 1955 and the last occupation troops left on 25 October that year.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Moscow Conference (1943)}}\n\nAt the 1943 Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union, United States, and the United Kingdom had jointly decided that the German annexation of Austria in 1938 would be considered \"null and void\". As well, all administrative and legal measures since 1938 would be ignored. The conference declared the intent to create a free and independent Austria after the war, but also stated that Austria had a responsibility for \"participation in the war at the side of Hitlerite Germany\" which could not be evaded.{{sfn|Conference delegates|1944|pp=3\u20138}}\n\n==1945\u20131946: first year of occupation==\n\n===Soviet rule and reestablishing Austrian government===\n{{further|Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet occupations|Austrian resistance}}\n\nOn 29 March 1945, Soviet commander [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]]'s troops crossed the former Austrian border at [[Klostermarienberg]] in [[Burgenland]].<ref name=E190>Eisterer 2009, p. 190.</ref> On 3 April, at the beginning of the [[Vienna Offensive]], the Austrian politician [[Karl Renner]], then living in southern [[Lower Austria]], established contact with the Soviets.

At first, Austria had to pay the whole occupation bill; in 1946 occupation costs were capped at 35% of Austrian state expenditures, equally split between the Soviets and the Western allies.<ref name=E201/>\n\nCoincidentally with the Second Control Agreement, the Soviets changed their economic policy from outright plunder to running expropriated Austrian businesses for a profit. Austrian communists advised Stalin to nationalize the whole economy, but he deemed the proposal to be too radical.<ref name=BO/> Between February and June 1946, the Soviets expropriated hundreds of businesses left in their zone.<ref name=S177/> On 27 June 1946, they amalgamated these assets into the [[Administration for Soviet Property in Austria|USIA]], a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of over 400 enterprises.<ref name=S75>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 75</ref> It controlled not more than 5% of Austrian economic output but possessed a substantial, or even monopolistic, share in the glass, steel, oil, and transportation industries.<ref name=S76>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 76.</ref> The USIA was weakly integrated with the rest of the Austrian economy; its products were primarily shipped to the East, its profits de facto confiscated and its taxes left unpaid by the Soviets. The Austrian government refused to recognize USIA [[legal title]] over its possessions; in retaliation, the USIA refused to pay Austrian taxes and tariffs.<ref name=S767>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> This competitive advantage helped to keep USIA enterprises afloat despite their mounting obsolescence. The Soviets had no intention to reinvest their profits, and USIA assets gradually decayed and lost their competitive edge.<ref>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 80; Komlosy 2000, p. 124.</ref> The Austrian government feared paramilitary communist gangs sheltered by the USIA<ref name=L146>Lewis 2000, p. 146.</ref> and scorned it for being \"an economy of exploitation in colonial style.\"<ref>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 77.</ref> The economy of the Soviet zone eventually reunited with the rest of the country.\n\n[[South Tyrol]] was returned to [[Italy]]. The \"thirty-second decision\" of the [[Council of Foreign Ministers]] to grant South Tyrol to Italy (4 September 1945) disregarded popular opinion in Austria and the possible effects of a [[expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced repatriation]] of 200,000 German-speaking Tyroleans.<ref>Steininger 2003, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> The decision was arguably motivated by the British desire to reward Italy, a country far more important for the [[containment]] of world communism. Renner's objections came in too late and carried too little weight to have effect.<ref>Steininger 2003, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Popular and official protests continued through 1946. The signatures of 150,000 South Tyroleans did not alter the decision.<ref>Steininger 2003, p. 83.</ref> South Tyrol is today an Italian autonomous province ([[South Tyrol|Bolzano/Bozen]]) with a German-speaking majority.\n\n==Hunger==\nIn 1947, the Austrian economy, including USIA enterprises, reached 61% of pre-war levels, but it was disproportionately weak in consumer goods production (42% of pre-war levels).<ref>Lewis 2000, pp. 141\u2013142, used 1937 as a base year, and wrote that \"1937 itself was a poor year\".</ref> Food remained the worst problem. The country, according to American reports, survived 1945 and 1946 on \"a near-starvation diet\" with [[rationing|daily rations]] remaining below 2000&nbsp;calories until the end of 1947.<ref>Lewis 2000, p. 142.</ref> 65% of Austrian agricultural output and nearly all oil was concentrated in the Soviet zone, complicating the Western Allies' task of feeding the population in their own zones.<ref name=Y148>Bailey, p. 148, wrote \"65% of pre-war yield\", not actual post-war output.</ref>\n\nFrom March 1946 to June 1947, 64% of these rations were provided by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|UNRRA]].<ref name=L143>Lewis 2000, p. 143.</ref> Heating depended on supplies of German coal shipped by the U.S. on lax credit terms.<ref name=G163>Gimbel 1976, p. 163.</ref> A 1946 drought further depressed farm output and [[hydroelectric power]] generation. Figl's government, the Chambers of Labor, Trade and Agriculture, and the [[Austrian Trade Union Federation]] (\u00d6GB) temporarily resolved the crisis in favor of tight regulation of food and labor markets. Wage increases were limited and locked to commodity prices through annual price-wage agreements.

In 1943 however, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] agreed in the [[Declaration of Moscow]] that Austria would instead be regarded as [[Austria \u2014 the Nazis' first victim|the first victim of Nazi aggression]], and treated as a liberated and independent country after the war.\n\nIn the immediate [[aftermath of World War II]], Austria was divided into four occupation zones and jointly occupied by the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Fourth French Republic|France]]. [[Vienna]] was similarly subdivided but the central district was collectively administered by the [[Allied Control Council]].\n\nWhereas Germany was divided into [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] in 1949, Austria remained under joint occupation of the Western Allies and of the Soviet Union until 1955; its status became a controversial subject in the [[Cold War]] until the warming of relations known as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. After Austrian promises of perpetual neutrality, Austria was accorded full independence on 15 May 1955 and the last occupation troops left on 25 October that year.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Moscow Conference (1943)}}\n\nAt the 1943 Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union, United States, and the United Kingdom had jointly decided that the German annexation of Austria in 1938 would be considered \"null and void\". As well, all administrative and legal measures since 1938 would be ignored. The conference declared the intent to create a free and independent Austria after the war, but also stated that Austria had a responsibility for \"participation in the war at the side of Hitlerite Germany\" which could not be evaded.{{sfn|Conference delegates|1944|pp=3\u20138}}\n\n==1945\u20131946: first year of occupation==\n\n===Soviet rule and reestablishing Austrian government===\n{{further|Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet occupations|Austrian resistance}}\n\nOn 29 March 1945, Soviet commander [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]]'s troops crossed the former Austrian border at [[Klostermarienberg]] in [[Burgenland]].<ref name=E190>Eisterer 2009, p. 190.</ref> On 3 April, at the beginning of the [[Vienna Offensive]], the Austrian politician [[Karl Renner]], then living in southern [[Lower Austria]], established contact with the Soviets.

The French and American zones bordered those countries' zones in Germany, and the Soviet zone bordered future [[Warsaw Pact]] states. Vienna was divided among all four Allies. The [[Innere Stadt|historical center of Vienna]] was declared an [[international zone]], in which occupation forces changed every month.

It refused to recognize Renner's claim of a national government but did not prevent him from extending influence into the Western zones. Renner appointed vocal anti-communist [[Karl Gruber]] as Foreign Minister and tried to reduce Communist influence. On 20 October 1945, Renner's reformed cabinet was recognized by the Western allies and received a go-ahead for the first legislative election.<ref name=S176>Bischof 2009, p. 176.</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Four-in-a-jeep allied patrol in Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|\"Four in a [[Jeep]]\" international patrol in the [[Innere Stadt]] of Vienna.]] -->\n\n===First general elections after the war===\n[[Austrian legislative election, 1945|The election held on 25 November 1945]] was a blow for the [[Communist Party of Austria]] which received a bit more than 5% of the vote.

Kennan]]'s ''[[X Article|The Long Telegram]]'', supported Truman's tough stance against the Soviets.<ref>Bischof 2009, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref> Thus, according to Bischof, the [[Cold War]] in Austria began in the spring of 1946, one year before [[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|the outbreak of the global Cold War]].<ref name=S177/>\n\nOn 28 June 1946, the Allies signed the Second Control Agreement that loosened their dominance over the Austrian government. The [[Parliament of Austria|Parliament]] was ''[[de facto]]'' relieved of Allied control. From now on its decision could be overturned only by unanimous vote by all four Allies.<ref name=S172>Bischof 2009, p. 172.</ref> Soviet [[veto]]es were routinely voided by Western opposition.<ref name=S172/> For the next nine years the country was gradually emancipated from foreign control, and evolved from a \"nation under tutelage\" to full independence.<ref name=S173>Bischof 2009, p. 173.</ref> The government possessed its own independent vision of the future, reacting to adverse circumstances and at times turning them to their own benefit.<ref>Lewis 2000, p. 139.</ref> The first allied talks on Austrian independence were held in January 1947, and deadlocked over the issue of \"German assets\" in Soviet possession.<ref name=S178/>\n\n==Mounting losses==\n{{further|Administration for Soviet Property in Austria{{!}}USIA|History of South Tyrol}}\n\nIn late 1945 and early 1946 the Allied occupation force peaked at around 150,000 Soviet, 55,000 British, 40,000 American, and 15,000 French troops.<ref name=E201/> The costs of keeping these troops were levied on the Austrian government. At first, Austria had to pay the whole occupation bill; in 1946 occupation costs were capped at 35% of Austrian state expenditures, equally split between the Soviets and the Western allies.<ref name=E201/>\n\nCoincidentally with the Second Control Agreement, the Soviets changed their economic policy from outright plunder to running expropriated Austrian businesses for a profit. Austrian communists advised Stalin to nationalize the whole economy, but he deemed the proposal to be too radical.<ref name=BO/> Between February and June 1946, the Soviets expropriated hundreds of businesses left in their zone.<ref name=S177/> On 27 June 1946, they amalgamated these assets into the [[Administration for Soviet Property in Austria|USIA]], a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of over 400 enterprises.<ref name=S75>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 75</ref> It controlled not more than 5% of Austrian economic output but possessed a substantial, or even monopolistic, share in the glass, steel, oil, and transportation industries.<ref name=S76>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 76.</ref> The USIA was weakly integrated with the rest of the Austrian economy; its products were primarily shipped to the East, its profits de facto confiscated and its taxes left unpaid by the Soviets. The Austrian government refused to recognize USIA [[legal title]] over its possessions; in retaliation, the USIA refused to pay Austrian taxes and tariffs.<ref name=S767>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> This competitive advantage helped to keep USIA enterprises afloat despite their mounting obsolescence. The Soviets had no intention to reinvest their profits, and USIA assets gradually decayed and lost their competitive edge.<ref>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 80; Komlosy 2000, p. 124.</ref> The Austrian government feared paramilitary communist gangs sheltered by the USIA<ref name=L146>Lewis 2000, p. 146.</ref> and scorned it for being \"an economy of exploitation in colonial style.\"<ref>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 77.</ref> The economy of the Soviet zone eventually reunited with the rest of the country.\n\n[[South Tyrol]] was returned to [[Italy]]. The \"thirty-second decision\" of the [[Council of Foreign Ministers]] to grant South Tyrol to Italy (4 September 1945) disregarded popular opinion in Austria and the possible effects of a [[expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced repatriation]] of 200,000 German-speaking Tyroleans.<ref>Steininger 2003, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> The decision was arguably motivated by the British desire to reward Italy, a country far more important for the [[containment]] of world communism. Renner's objections came in too late and carried too little weight to have effect.<ref>Steininger 2003, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Popular and official protests continued through 1946. The signatures of 150,000 South Tyroleans did not alter the decision.<ref>Steininger 2003, p. 83.</ref> South Tyrol is today an Italian autonomous province ([[South Tyrol|Bolzano/Bozen]]) with a German-speaking majority.\n\n==Hunger==\nIn 1947, the Austrian economy, including USIA enterprises, reached 61% of pre-war levels, but it was disproportionately weak in consumer goods production (42% of pre-war levels).<ref>Lewis 2000, pp. 141\u2013142, used 1937 as a base year, and wrote that \"1937 itself was a poor year\".</ref> Food remained the worst problem. The country, according to American reports, survived 1945 and 1946 on \"a near-starvation diet\" with [[rationing|daily rations]] remaining below 2000&nbsp;calories until the end of 1947.<ref>Lewis 2000, p. 142.</ref> 65% of Austrian agricultural output and nearly all oil was concentrated in the Soviet zone, complicating the Western Allies' task of feeding the population in their own zones.<ref name=Y148>Bailey, p. 148, wrote \"65% of pre-war yield\", not actual post-war output.</ref>\n\nFrom March 1946 to June 1947, 64% of these rations were provided by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|UNRRA]].<ref name=L143>Lewis 2000, p. 143.</ref> Heating depended on supplies of German coal shipped by the U.S. on lax credit terms.<ref name=G163>Gimbel 1976, p. 163.</ref> A 1946 drought further depressed farm output and [[hydroelectric power]] generation. Figl's government, the Chambers of Labor, Trade and Agriculture, and the [[Austrian Trade Union Federation]] (\u00d6GB) temporarily resolved the crisis in favor of tight regulation of food and labor markets. Wage increases were limited and locked to commodity prices through annual price-wage agreements. The negotiations set a model of [[consensus decision-making|building consensus]] between elected and non-elected political elites that became the basis of post-war Austrian democracy,<ref name=L149>Lewis 2000, p. 149.</ref> known as ''Austrian Social Partnership'' and ''[[Corporatism|Austro-corporatism]]''.<ref>For a review of evolution of Austrian Social Partnership see Bischof et al. 1996.</ref>\n\nThe severe winter of 1946\u20131947 was followed by the disastrous summer of 1947, when the [[potato]] harvest barely reached 30% of pre-war output.<ref name=L143/> The food shortages were aggravated by the withdrawal of UNRRA aid, spiraling inflation, and the demoralizing failure of State Treaty talks.<ref name=L143/> In April 1947, the government was unable to distribute any rations, and on 5 May Vienna was shaken by a violent food riot.<ref name=L147>Lewis 2000, p. 147.</ref> Unlike earlier protests, the demonstrators, led by the Communists, called to curb the westernisation of Austrian politics.<ref name=L148>Lewis 2000, p. 148.</ref> In August, a food riot in [[Bad Ischl]] turned into a [[pogrom]] of local Jews.<ref>Berg 2000, p. 165.</ref> In November, the food shortage sparked workers' strikes in British-occupied [[Styria]].<ref name=L148/> Figl's government declared that the food riots were a failed communist [[coup d'etat|putsch]], although later historians said this was an exaggeration.<ref name=S178>Bischof 2009, p. 178.</ref><ref name=L148/>\n\nIn June 1947, the month when the UNRRA stopped shipments of food to Austria, the extent of the food crisis compelled the U.S. government to issue $300 million in food aid. In the same month Austria was invited to discuss its participation in the [[Marshall Plan]].<ref name=L145>Lewis 2000, p. 145.</ref> Direct aid and subsidies helped Austria to survive the hunger of 1947. On the other hand, they depressed food prices and thus discouraged local farmers, delaying the rebirth of Austrian agriculture.<ref name=L143>Lewis 2000, p. 143.</ref>\n\n==Marshall Plan==\nAustria finalized its [[Marshall Plan]] program in the end of 1947 and received the first [[tranche]] of Marshall Plan aid in March 1948.<ref name=L144>Lewis 2000, p. 144.</ref> Heavy industry (or what was left of it) was concentrated around [[Linz]], in the American zone, and in British-occupied [[Styria]].

This was the only case where Marshall Plan funds were distributed in Soviet-occupied territory.<ref>Fraberger, Stiefel 2000, p. 83.</ref>\n\nThe Marshall Plan was not universally popular, especially in its initial phase.<ref name=L138>Lewis 2000, p. 138.</ref> It benefited some trades such as metallurgy but depressed others such as agriculture. Heavy industries quickly recovered, from 74.7% of pre-war output in 1948 to 150.7% in 1951.<ref>Bader, p. 160, uses 1937 as the base year (100%).</ref> American planners deliberately neglected consumer goods industries, construction trades, and small business. Their workers, almost half of the industrial workforce, suffered from rising unemployment.<ref name=BA1601>Bader, pp. 160\u2013161.</ref> In 1948\u20131949, a substantial share of Marshall Plan funds was used to subsidize imports of food.
